Reporting fall in lung function and putting in negative figures is the old convention, but as there are no pooled results I have not changed this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS&lt;br&gt;This is very interesting to me but far too long and technical for a lay reader. Please replace with a single headline summary sentence and one paragraph summary of the condition and results in lay terms!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS&lt;br&gt;Vast amount of detail about excluded studies has been put into this review.

Azathioprine and Interferon were studied as additional theray, whilst colchicine was compared with oral corticosteroids.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have amended the above as it was not correct to say that no trials were placebo controlled (the first one is a placebo controlled add on trial).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are concerns about the generalisability of this trial which used subjects&amp;quot; Partial sentence removed from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluded Study details&lt;br&gt;In view of all the data collected here Toby will kindly paste the details from the previous version into an additional table. It would be a shame to lose all this work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Those trials incorporating control arms used standard oral corticosteroid treatment. There were no true placebo arms incorporated into any reviewed study.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;From the description of studies it appears that there is a placebo comparison in at least the first study (but both arms were given steroids as additional treatment). I have therefore altered this to no studies compared with placebo alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent back to Toby for Additional table and then can go on for Copy Editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: =Immunomodulatory agents for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Welsh 5th July 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have generated a risk of bias table and referenced it in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent use of interferon gamma-1B/beta?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors ask for quality of life to be measured in trials - perhaps this should be included in a future update?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-07-29 11:39:24 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="IMM-OTH " REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.24" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="5.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a form of progressive lung disease which ultimately leads to death. The cause is unknown, but the disease is characterised by scar tissue in the lungs. This prevents the lungs from working effectively. Standard treatment uses oral corticosteroids in association with immunosuppressors, but there is uncertainty as to whether this treatment is effective. Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide have been used to treat the disease because it is thought they might prevent inflammation. The review found 15 high quality trials of non-steroid drugs tested in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Notwithstanding the encouraging results of a first small study included in the first version of this review, the effects of interferon gamma-1beta, as assessed by combining two subsequent large trials, were disappointing and failed to show an effect on improving survival. Four studies did evaluate pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic oral drug, on a large number of patients: although two of these studies have only been presented in conferences,combining the published and unpublished data showed a significant improvement of pirfenidone on progression-free survival and a small increase in pulmonary function. Current evidence suggests a possible role for pirfenidone in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, though data on survival are now needed. However, trials with other non-steroid agents are currently ongoing and new evidence may become available soon.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (30 March 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2010), Ovid MEDLINE to March week 5, 2010, EMBASE to week 13, 2010 and PubMed to April 2010, with additional handsearching, including abstracts of international conferences.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Fifteen trials involving 10 different drugs were included. Two trials enrolling 1156 patients compared interferon gamma-1beta with placebo: interferon gamma-1beta did not significantly improve survival (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.64; P = 0.68). Four trials involving 1155 patients compared pirfenidone with placebo. Three trials, conducted in 1046 patients, provided data on progression-free survival: pirfenidone significantly reduced the risk of disease progression by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88, P = 0.002). Data on the effect of pirfenidone on pulmonary function could only be assessed for two studies analysing 314 patients. Forced vital capacity or vital capacity was significantly improved by pirfenidone (mean difference 0.08 L, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.13, P = 0.0006).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Based on available data, partly still unpublished, pirfenidone appears to improve progression-free survival and, to a lesser extent, pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. More data are needed on overall survival and quality of life on treatment. From the studies in this review, interferon gamma-1beta has not been shown to affect survival. Other agents evaluated in single studies either failed to provide evidence for a benefit or need to be assessed in larger randomised controlled trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease occurring primarily in older adults, characterised by a chronic course and a generally poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2002</LINK>). It is a specific form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia limited to the lung, associated with the pathological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on surgical lung biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Visscher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visscher 2006</LINK>). The diagnosis of IPF also requires the exclusion of other forms of interstitial pneumonia, including those associated with environmental exposure, drugs or systemic disease (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of IPF is currently unknown, although a number of possible mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis have been described. Among factors potentially associated with IPF pathogenesis, cigarette smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iwai-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwai 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steele-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taskar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taskar 2006</LINK>), environmental exposures (including metal and wood dusts, <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 2005</LINK>), microbial agents (mostly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsukamoto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsukamoto 2000</LINK>) and hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Arase-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arase 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meliconi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meliconi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 2005</LINK>), and gastro-oesophageal reflux (<LINK REF="REF-Raghu-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raghu 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1998</LINK>) are those most studied. Genetic factors have also been associated with susceptibility to develop IPF, in both familial (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steele-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 2005</LINK>) and sporadic forms (<LINK REF="REF-Checa--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Checa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falfan_x002d_Valencia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falfan-Valencia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zuo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuo 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The underlying process in IPF is thought to be fibroproliferative in nature: it seems likely that the pathogenic process involves repeated episodes of acute lung injury caused by a yet unidentified stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Bois-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Bois 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of IPF has not been evaluated in large studies, but available data estimate IPF incidence at 10.7 cases per 100,000 per year for men and 7.4 cases per 100,000 per year for women (<LINK REF="REF-Coultas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coultas 1994</LINK>). Moreover, some data indicate the incidence rate of IPF to be increasing in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Gribbin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gribbin 2006</LINK>). A recent study from the US calculated an incidence between 6.8 and 16.3 per 100,000 people (<LINK REF="REF-Raghu-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raghu 2006b</LINK>). Prevalence estimates ranged  from 2 to 29 cases per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Iwai-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwai 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karakatsani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karakatsani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>). Recent data provided a prevalence estimate between 14.0 and 42.7 per 100,000 persons depending on the diagnostic criteria applied (<LINK REF="REF-Raghu-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raghu 2006b</LINK>). Comparing incidence and prevalence data gives an estimate of survival with IPF of just two to three years.</P>
<P>IPF follows a variable clinical course in which periods of relative stability are mixed with episodes of accelerated decline, possibly resulting in respiratory failure and death (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2005</LINK>): this makes the natural history of the disease unpredictable in the individual patient (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Bois-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Bois 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2008</LINK>). IPF has been reported as the primary cause of death in 89% of patients who died in a cohort of 168 IPF patients in the placebo group of a large randomised trial (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Episodes of acute respiratory worsening occur in a minority (5% to 10%) of IPF patients (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BUILD-1" TYPE="STUDY">BUILD 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collard 2007</LINK>). When a cause cannot be identified for the acute respiratory decline, the term acute exacerbation of IPF is used (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Churg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kondoh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondoh 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondoh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kondoh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kubo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2005</LINK>). Although it is still unclear whether acute exacerbations represent an acceleration in the pathological processes involved in IPF, these clinical events are important in the natural history of the disease since mortality after an acute exacerbation exceeds 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Collard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collard 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The histological features of IPF/UIP characteristically include lesions of different age and location, showing some preference for the peripheral subpleural parenchyma. In this context, the pathologic hallmark and the main diagnostic criterion on lung pathology is the heterogeneous appearance at low magnification in which areas of fibrosis with scarring and honeycomb change alternate with areas of less affected or normal parenchyma (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>;<U> </U>
<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2002</LINK>). Within the fibrotic regions there may be areas of chronic lung injury with scar formation and patches of acute injury with proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts occurring at sites of recent alveolar damage. Inflammation is usually mild, while fibrotic zones are composed of dense collagen: foci of proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (the fibroblast foci) are a consistent finding and a key diagnostic element.</P>
<P>According to current guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>), the diagnosis of IPF is based on (i) the exclusion of other causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD), (ii) abnormal pulmonary function tests showing a restrictive pattern and/or decreased diffusion lung capacity (DLCO) and (iii) a radiologic pattern on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest showing bibasilar reticular abnormalities, honeycombing and minimal 'ground glass' opacity (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>). These features in association with a typical clinical presentation are usually adequate for diagnostic purposes and biopsy is generally considered unnecessary in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hunninghake-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunninghake 2001</LINK>). Approximately 30% of cases show atypical features clinically or on HRCT chest scan (extensive 'ground glass' opacity), which are usually considered to be an indication for surgical lung biopsy (SLB) (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raghu-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raghu 1999a</LINK>). Transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimens generally provide unreliable material for diagnostic purposes in IPF and the other 'alphabet soup interstitial pneumonitides' (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shure-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shure 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shure-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shure 1989</LINK>). A revision of the current diagnostic criteria is expected to be published very soon and a major emphasis will be put on the role of chest HRCT. The typical HRCT UIP pattern will be defined as the presence of reticular opacities, often associated with traction bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Johkoh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johkoh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 1992</LINK>) and honeycombing (<LINK REF="REF-Hansell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansell 2008</LINK>) in the absence of extensive ground glass opacities: the distribution of HRCT lesions in IPF is typically basal and peripheral, though often patchy. The presence of a typical HRCT pattern and the exclusion of other causes for interstitial lung disease will be the main factors for IPF diagnosis, therefore reducing the role of pulmonary function and bronchoscopy.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Soon after the publication of the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>), a number of basic research studies on the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis led to translational studies exploring innovative approaches to the treatment of IPF. A variety of biological factors and complex pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and in particular of IPF (<LINK REF="REF-Hardie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardie 2009</LINK>). Although most of the pharmacologic agents used in IPF trials have proved to be effective in animal models of lung fibrosis, unfortunately currently available animal models of pulmonary fibrosis do not seem to provide an exact copy of IPF pathogenesis and appear to be of limited utility in predicting the results in clinical IPF trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gauldie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauldie 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moeller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moeller 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only studies investigating treatment in IPF/UIP have been included in this systematic review. In contrast to the previous version of this review, when many of the included studies were carried out using less stringent diagnostic criteria for IPF, the new studies included in the present review have been conducted on a more homogeneous population of patients, and more vigorous inclusion criteria based on American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.</P>
<P>Optimal treatment of IPF remains contentious and at the moment there are no clear-cut recommendations on how to treat patients affected by IPF. Although this might be regarded as bad news for patients and physicians, nonetheless, major advances have occurred since the compilation of the previous version of this systematic review. A Cochrane Review investigating the role of corticosteroids in IPF (UIP) has failed to find any evidence that corticosteroids are of proven benefit in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Richeldi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richeldi 2003</LINK>). As a consequence, treatment of IPF with corticosteroid alone or corticosteroid in combination with azathioprine is no longer recommended: this is reflected also in the recent guidelines released by the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008</LINK>). However, some controversial findings have arisen from some large randomised trials of potentially efficacious drugs in IPF and the scope of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential benefits of these treatments. Given the rapidly increasing number of trials suitable for inclusion in a systematic analysis, in this review it has been possible for the first time to perform meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Much discussion is currently ongoing about the appropriate endpoints and outcome measures in clinical trials of IPF. Given the progressive nature of the disease, survival (or progression-free survival) should be regarded as the most appropriate endpoint for assessing drug efficacy in clinical trials. However, trials adequately powered for mortality outcomes require large cohorts of patients - which is quite challenging for a relatively rare disease, unless studies are conducted on a national/international basis - and mature follow up. A logical surrogate for mortality has been the use of change in FVC, as more rapid decline in FVC is associated with increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>). However, this measure is not yet unanimously accepted by regulatory agencies as an adequate stand-alone endpoint. On the other hand, exercise physiology measures, such as the 6MWT or oxygen desaturation during 6MWT are complicated and poorly reproducible. Composite indices of lung function tests have been shown to be predictive of outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2003</LINK>), but as yet there are no published studies of their use in randomised clinical trials. Combined pulmonary function end points may be more robust - with the possible incorporation of biomarkers, when more convincing data on their value in the prediction of outcome or the stratification of individuals in treatment groups will be available - and could represent a valid option to be considered for future trials. However, because IPF is a disease that tends to progress chronically, and is unlikely to improve substantially, disease stabilisation is probably the best outcome that can be expected, with important implications for the design of future clinical trials.</P>
<P>Only six years after the previous systematic search, nine new randomised controlled trials have been completed and published in full or reported at major international conferences. Although at the moment of writing this review only pirfenidone has been approved for IPF, and only in Japan, the currently available data and the rapidly growing number of ongoing and planned randomised trials make it likely that new drugs will be available in the future.</P>

<P>The measure of association chosen for combining the overall survival and progression-free survival was the hazard ratio (HR), estimated by dividing the hazard of mortality or progression in the treatment group by the hazard in the control one. Values less than one indicate that the experimental treatment is better than control, values equal to one indicate that the two treatments have similar efficacy, whereas values greater than one suggest that control is better than treatment. The HRs estimated were directly extracted from the original papers or provided by the authors or indirectly obtained by using Parmar's method (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In those studies comparing more than one dose and therefore with more than two arms the comparison used for the meta-analysis was conducted by selecting the arm in which the higher dose was administrated and comparing it with the control one.</P>

<P>There were 15 eligible trials conducted in 3033 patients.</P>
<P>Three RCTs investigating the effects of interferon gamma-1beta have been included; two of them (<LINK REF="STD-INSPIRE" TYPE="STUDY">INSPIRE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>), enrolling 1156 patients, compared the treatment arm versus placebo, while the third (<LINK REF="STD-Ziesche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ziesche 1999</LINK>) compared the combination of oral prednisolone and interferon gamma-1beta (given subcutaneously) versus oral prednisolone alone.</P>

<P>Among the 15 included studies, six trials were considered suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses, which have been performed for two drugs, interferon gamma-1beta and pirfenidone (partly using unpublished data).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy of interferon gamma-1beta</HEADING>
<P>Three trials assessing efficacy of interferon gamma-1beta were identified (<LINK REF="STD-INSPIRE" TYPE="STUDY">INSPIRE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziesche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ziesche 1999</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-INSPIRE" TYPE="STUDY">INSPIRE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>) provided the information about mortality by reporting the estimates of the hazard ratio (HR). The combination of the two estimates did not show any statistically significant differences in mortality between interferon and placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.64). The results do not provide evidence that interferon is more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>) observed that interferon gamma-1beta therapy did not significantly affect progression-free survival (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The two studies also did not show a significant difference with respect to the change in FVC (<LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>: -0.20 litres in the interferon gamma-1beta group versus -0.16 litres in the placebo group; <LINK REF="STD-INSPIRE" TYPE="STUDY">INSPIRE</LINK>: -15.3% versus -14.5%; P = 0.691). The <LINK REF="STD-Ziesche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ziesche 1999</LINK> study reported a significant increase in FVC with interferon gamma-1beta; however, the authors did not provide enough information to allow these results to be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy of pirfenidone</HEADING>
<P>Four trials assessing efficacy of pirfenidone were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK> did not report data on progression-free survival. Therefore three studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) were included in the meta-analysis of progression-free survival: <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK> reported the estimate of the hazard ratio as well as its 95% confidence interval; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK> did not provide the value of the hazard ratio, which was instead indirectly estimated by using the information reported by the authors on the survival curves, such as percentage of progression-free survival and number of patients at risk at different points in time, and the P value of the log rank test. Similar and significant differences were observed in progression-free survival time between the pirfenidone and the placebo arm for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>), while a non-significant effect was observed for <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The summary of the three estimates suggests that pirfenidone reduces the risk of progression by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies included FVC as a primary endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>) while two (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) used VC. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) reported the results in litres, whereas the other two (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>) reported the results in percent of predicted FVC at different points in time from baseline. Based on the unpublished data received from the sponsor, the mean decline from baseline in percent predicted FVC at week 72 did not differ between the pirfenidone and placebo groups in <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>, and in <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>, the higher dose group (pirfenidone 2403 mg/day) successfully met the change from baseline in percent predicted FVC with a significant reduction in the mean decline compared with placebo. The authors of the latter two studies analysed the results by using ANCOVA rank analysis. The heterogeneity of statistical methods across studies did not allow us to combine their results. In <LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK> significant differences were observed in terms of decline of VC between the pirfenidone and the placebo groups. The result of meta-analysis, analysing 314 patients, confirms the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on the change of VC compared to baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:52:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review represents a major update of the previous version. There has been a substantial increase in both the number and quality of randomised controlled trials on IPF treatment. In the last version of this review, the quality of the retrieved studies was generally poor and only three trials (assessing three different treatments) of suitable quality for inclusion were identified. Six years later, the number of included studies has increased to 15 (evaluating 10 drugs) and the methodological quality of these new studies was judged overall to be high. As a direct consequence, the findings of the review have changed substantially. The retrieved data allowed the combination of the results of single studies into two meta-analyses and improved the precision of the estimates from the available studies; improving our knowledge of IPF treatment. The willingness of two pharmaceutical companies (Shionogi in Japan and Intermune in USA) to provide us with unpublished data has permitted us to explore the evidence base more thoroughly than would otherwise have been possible based on the results reported in the current literature. </P>
<P>Two placebo randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-INSPIRE" TYPE="STUDY">INSPIRE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2004</LINK>) assessing subcutaneous interferon gamma-1beta, both of high quality and evaluating a total of 1156 IPF patients, did not confirm the initial finding of a small RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Ziesche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ziesche 1999</LINK>) and the results of a post hoc analysis on a sub-population of patients with early disease from the first of these two large studies. A meta-analysis of these two trials did not provide evidence of a beneficial effect for interferon gamma-1beta in improving the overall survival of IPF patients (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.64; P = 0.68).</P>
<P>Four placebo randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) explored the effect of pirfenidone on the decline of pulmonary function, as measured by means of decrease in FVC or VC; three of them (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) also assessed the effect on progression-free survival (as defined by the authors) which was obtained for 894 IPF patients. The combination of the estimates of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) showed that pirfenidone significantly reduced the risk of disease progression by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88). Although all four studies assessed the effect of pirfenidone on pulmonary function (by measuring either FVC or VC), differences in reporting results did not allow us to combine the data from all these studies. Whilst our decision not to combine these data from different RCTs may be justified on methodological grounds, they nevertheless assess similar functional endpoints and there is a need for future IPF trials to be rigorous and homogeneous in both their design and reporting. We emphasise the importance of accurate description of all methodological aspects to enable reliable appraisal and correct interpretation of results. Only the results on pulmonary function from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azuma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Azuma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniguchi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taniguchi 2010</LINK>) could be combined in a meta-analysis, involving 314 Japanese IPF patients: a positive effect of pirfenidone in slowing the reduction of pulmonary function was observed.</P>
<P>The findings of these meta-analyses on both progression-free survival (PFS) and lung function seem to indicate a clinically relevant effect of pirfenidone in patients with IPF. However, despite a significant effect on the combined endpoint of progression-free survival, some uncertainty applies to our findings, since the results of two large RCTs included in the meta-analysis have not been published yet in peer-reviewed journals (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>). The recent approval of pirfenidone for IPF treatment in Japan might suggest a potential relevance of the results of this drug in IPF. On the other hand, the FDA has recently declined approval of pirfenidone for treatment of IPF and asked for additional and stronger evidence of efficacy of pirfenidone in IPF. What are now needed are data on mortality and overall survival, as well as quality of life (QoL) on pirfenidone.</P>
<P>Data on single studies assessing eight other drugs have also been included in this updated version of the review. In particular, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-IFIGENIA" TYPE="STUDY">IFIGENIA</LINK> assessing the effects of N-acetylcysteine in combination with prednisone and azathioprine, as compared to combined prednisone and azathioprine, merit some discussion. With regard to study methodology, the findings of this trial are weakened by the lack of a true placebo arm, since patients in the placebo arm were all treated with a combination of prednisone and azathioprine: fortunately, a specifically designed RCT (the PANTHER trial) directly comparing N-acetylcysteine with placebo is currently ongoing in the United States in the context of the 'IPFnet' clinical trial network. On the other hand, a recently published analysis of the data set generated by the IFIGENIA trial (<LINK REF="REF-Behr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behr 2009</LINK>) suggests that, when considering the subgroup of patients who completed the trial, pulmonary function did not significantly change in the arm treated with N-acetylcysteine, whereas most functional indices deteriorated in the arm not including N-acetylcysteine and treated with prednisone and azathioprine only; in addition, many of the categorical analyses of VC and DLCO showed favourable changes with N-acetylcysteine. These findings, although interesting and likely to generate new hypotheses, are fully based on post hoc descriptive analyses and, as such, the body of evidence identified for N-acetylcysteine does not currently permit robust conclusions regarding its effect in modifying the natural history of the disease. However, since this appears to be a safe and well-tolerated drug, on the balance of probabilities it would be reasonable to offer it to patients until definitive trial data are available in the near future.</P>
<P>The efficacy and the safety of the anticoagulant drug warfarin has been assessed in a small randomised, multicentre clinical trial in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Kubo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kubo 2005</LINK>). The primary endpoints (overall survival and hospitalisation-free period) showed a significant difference in survival between the two study groups favouring anticoagulant therapy: mortality associated with acute exacerbations of IPF was significantly reduced in the anticoagulant group as compared to the non-anticoagulant group, while the two groups did not significantly differ in terms of hospitalisation-free periods. Although these findings look promising, some methodological issues prevented a precise assessment of the benefit of warfarin effect in IPF. In particular, the high rate of IPF exacerbations might reflect unusually high rates of hospitalisation of patients with different characteristics of IPF natural history in Japan. The considerable early withdrawal in the warfarin arm and its possible impact on the randomisation process (due to a lack of an intention-to-treat approach) as well as the lack of a true placebo arm may have biased the study result. As for N-acetylcysteine, the IPFnet is running a RCT assessing warfarin in a study with a placebo-controlled design, and given the potential side effects of anticoagulation it may be prudent to await these results before routinely offering warfarin to IPF patients.</P>
<P>The recombinant soluble human TNF-alpha receptor etanercept, a TNF antagonist, has been evaluated in a randomised, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raghu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 2008</LINK>): primary endpoints (change in the percentage of predicted FVC or DLCO, and in the P(A-a)O<SUB>2</SUB> at rest) were not affected and, as such, the trial did not provide evidence for an effect of this drug in physiological outcomes associated with IPF. Nonetheless, the study only enrolled a relatively small population and since the results suggest that this drug has a favourable safety profile, a larger study is justified before a positive effect can be ruled out definitively.</P>
<P>Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been evaluated in a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2010</LINK>) on 119 IPF patients. The primary outcome (a combined measure of disease progression or death) did not reach statistical significance. Other studies on multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing and the results of one phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are expected to be available in late 2010.</P>
<P>Bosentan is an antagonist of endothelin-1 A and B receptors, and because of the pro-fibrotic effects of endothelin-1 receptor activation, it has been hypothesised that bosentan might have beneficial effects in IPF. A double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-BUILD-1" TYPE="STUDY">BUILD 1</LINK>) assessed the effect of bosentan on change in exercise capacity, as measured by a modified six-minute walking test. Bosentan showed no superiority over placebo; however, an apparently rather arbitrary post hoc analysis showed a trend in favour of bosentan with respect to time to death or disease progression in patients diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy. Based upon these findings, a large phase III trial (BUILD 3) has been conducted: recently, the sponsor has released the preliminary results of this trial, showing that the primary endpoint (reduction in morbidity/mortality) was not significantly different between the two study groups (P = 0.21). Although the results of the BUILD trials do not provide evidence for an effect of bosentan in IPF, a further study on 150 IPF patients treated with the new endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan, is currently enrolling patients.</P>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Despite encouraging data from the original trial on interferon gamma-1beta included in the previous version of this systematic review, none of subsequent studies of this drug included in this updated review provided further evidence in support of the original findings. Evidence for the use of azathioprine remains limited to one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Raghu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 1991</LINK>) showing a small but statistically significant long-term survival advantage for azathioprine once allowance was made for age differences. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Douglas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 1998</LINK>) showed that colchicine is no more effective as a treatment than prednisone, with no significant difference in outcomes; cyclophosphamide continues to have very limited evidence for use in IPF patients (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>). The evidence available for any of these drugs is probably insufficient to support their clinical use.The most commonly used combination in IPF of azathioprine plus prednisolone has still not been tested against placebo therapy.</P>
<P>As outlined above, this review might be affected by some potential biases, although most of them are outside of control of the authors, being related to the data provided by the pharmaceutical companies sponsoring the pirfenidone trials. It is highly likely that all relevant studies were identified and included in the review, although probably not all relevant data has been obtained, especially on survival/mortality and QoL. Nonetheless, unpublished results on pirfenidone have also been publicly disclosed in the context of the FDA evaluation of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Sponsor_x0027_s-Briefing-Document-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sponsor's Briefing Document 2010</LINK>). We shall undertake a careful re-evaluation of the data on pirfenidone after full publication of the two currently unpublished trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-1" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPACITY-2" TYPE="STUDY">CAPACITY 2</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:53:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The meta-analyses performed in this updated review on non-steroid drugs to treat IPF showed no evidence for a beneficial effect of interferon gamma-1beta based on two large randomised trials. On the other hand, for pirfenidone, a meta-analysis of three large randomised trials showed evidence of a beneficial effect: in particular, the size of the effect on progression-free survival, a patient-important outcome, suggests a clinically relevant benefit for patients. However, our meta-analysis on pirfenidone for IPF was mainly based on unpublished data. In addition, based on available data, which include the full results of the CAPACITY 1 and 2 trials, the FDA has denied approval of pirfenidone for treatment of IPF and asked for an additional clinical trial: pirfenidone is also currently under evaluation in Europe. In any case, at this moment additional data on mortality and quality of life with pirfenidone are needed and should be considered in future systematic reviews.</P>
<P>The positive findings for N-acetylcysteine should be regarded as provisional considering the lack of a true placebo arm and the limited follow up of the study sample. Since at the time of this update pirfenidone has not been approved for clinical use in most countries, except Japan, enrolment in placebo-controlled clinical trials still remains a valid option for patients with IPF. The level of evidence available for other drugs, including warfarin, bosentan, imatinib and etanercept, is insufficient to allow any firm conclusion on their use in clinical practice, although some of these drugs merit further investigation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-19 11:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Further research is needed to clarify the natural history of IPF, with particular emphasis on different clinical phenotypes, based on differences in survival, rates of acute exacerbations, ethnicity and co-morbidities (e.g. pulmonary arterial hypertension). Research to assess the real burden of disease in different geographic regions will also be needed. In this context, the creation or the extension of supra-national research networks is certainly needed. Although continuously increasing, the current evidence to treat these patients is limited. There are no prognostic factors which have been extensively validated in prospective studies and therefore biomarkers cannot be used to select subgroups with different survival in randomised controlled trials. Since no new drugs have been approved for use at the moment, except for Japan, further trials need to be placebo-controlled and the use of 'routine care' only in the comparator arm should be discouraged. It has to be noted that the use of post hoc analyses to identify 'responder' groups to be included in future trials have largely been arbitrary and this practice should be avoided. Given the progressive nature of the disease, researchers will need to show improvements in overall survival or progression-free survival, although other surrogate markers (e.g. FVC) might help to assess potential efficacy in smaller and essentially pilot studies. For these surrogate endpoints it should become important and routine to report results using statistical analysis that may allow some informal assessment of replication if not combination of data in meta-analyses. Future research should focus on large suitably powered placebo-controlled trials assessing the effect of drugs on clinically relevant endpoints (ideally overall survival), with a duration of intervention of at least nine to 18 months and with pre-specified statistical analyses based on an intention-to-treat design. To obtain sufficient recruits in such studies national or even inter-national collaborative studies are necessary, and smaller studies should be discouraged by Ethics and Research Advisory committees.</P>
<P>The progressive nature of IPF implies that survival-related outcomes should be the focus of intense clinical research. In particular, attention should be drawn in the future to the effect of therapy on progression-free survival and categorical changes in functional indices: additional data need to be generated to assess whether such endpoints should become the standard measures in future IPF clinical trials.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fulmer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Fulmer 1978</LINK> was only ever reported in abstract form. This study examined the effects of the addition of azathioprine to prednisone in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled fashion. Twenty-six patients in the "mid-course" of IPF were enrolled. One group received prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, tapering to 0.25 mg/kg/day plus placebo: the other received prednisone in a similar schedule plus azathioprine at 2.5 mg/kg/day. The diagnostic, inclusion and exclusion criteria used were not described, nor were randomisation or blinding techniques described.</P>
<P>Follow up was at 6 and 12 months with review of "24 parameters derived from measurements of [PFTs and arterial blood gases]". Five patients developed drug toxicity, 2 in the placebo group and 3 in the azathioprine group. There were no significant differences reported in any measured or derived parameter at the end of 6 or 12 months. Patients were also ranked by the degree of cellularity and the severity of fibrosis seen in biopsy specimens, which however failed to unmask any significant differences. Some individual responses were seen but these were not significantly different between groups. The authors concluded that there was no difference in outcomes and considered that azathioprine was of no benefit.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: This study was excluded as there was inadequate data provided in the published abstract. After 24 years it is considered unlikely that additional meaningful information is available for this trial.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Winterbauer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Winterbauer 1978</LINK>. A prospective open-label uncontrolled trial that followed 20 patients with biopsy proven diffuse interstitial pneumonitis. The histological appearance varied, and UIP, DIP and LIP were all observed in tissue specimens. All subjects were treated with high-dose oral prednisone initially, tapering down to a maintenance dose of 10 to 20 mg daily after 7 weeks. All patients were commenced on azathioprine (3 mg/kg/day as single daily dose) after 3 months of corticosteroid therapy. Treatment was for a total of 12 months (9 months on azathioprine), following which it was discontinued in most patients. Azathioprine use was terminated early in 3 subjects due to adverse reactions.</P>
<P>5/20 subjects had evidence of multisystem disease despite the exclusion of patients with known collagen vascular diseases. Additionally 2 subjects had recently developed malignant lymphomas. There was also a history of chronic nitrofurantoin use in 2 other subjects. 5/20 also showed precipitating antibodies to allergic alveolitis antigens.</P>
<P>12/20 improved vital capacity by greater than 20%. Two out of this group of 12 died during a mean 30-month follow-up period (range 15 to 44 months). The deaths were from 1) recurrent lymphoma and 2) superimposed infections (TB and pulmonary aspergillosis). 7/8 of patients in the unimproved group died during a mean 13 month follow-up period, 6 from respiratory failure. The difference in death rates was highly significant (P = 0.0032).</P>
<P>In the 16 who survived 12 months or longer, there were statistically significant improvements in FVC, resting and exercise PaO<SUB>2</SUB>, P(A-a)O<SUB>2 </SUB>and anatomical shunt. Amongst clinical features, only duration of symptoms and extrapulmonary manifestations of disease correlated with therapeutic response, with most improvement in those with the briefest illness. Overall 60% improved with therapy. A statistical assessment of the effects of azathioprine was not performed due to the small sample size. Histological variation in appearance was more common in the treatment-responsive group.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: This study was excluded from statistical analysis as it was an uncontrolled, open-label trial. There were several subjects included with conditions other than UIP/IPF - histological appearances as described by the authors make it highly likely that a considerable number of patients would have DIP under modern classification schemes. Additionally a number of subjects with extra-pulmonary manifestations of disease may well have had an unrecognised multisystem disease process.<BR/>

Only patients with histologically proven (14/21) or clinically typical UIP were included in the reported results, although it is unclear whether this distinction was made prospectively or retrospectively.</P>
<P>Patients were treated with prednisone 0.6 mg/kg orally daily reducing over 12 weeks to 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg and either (1) azathioprine 3 mg/kg orally daily for 12 weeks reducing then to 2 mg/kg, or (2) D-penicillamine 5 mg/kg orally daily increasing weekly to 30 mg/kg/day; after 1 year this was reduced to 15 to 20 mg/kg/day. 21 patients were included, with one withdrawal from each arm due to side or adverse effects.</P>
<P>Follow up was for up to 8 years in the azathioprine group, with 5/11 subjects surviving this long.

However 15/51 also had evidence of connective tissue disorders in other systems making it likely that they in fact had another form of pulmonary fibrosis. Of the remaining 36, histological confirmation of the diagnosis was available in 30. 10/36 were already receiving immunosuppressive therapy in the form of prednisone. One subject was also taking penicillamine. BAL was performed at study commencement. The value of differential lavage cell counts as a predictor for maintained response to treatment was assessed.</P>
<P>Response to therapy with prednisone or other immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents was monitored over 12 months to determine initial (1 month) and maintained (12-month) response. Subjects not already on immunosuppressive therapy were commenced upon prednisone. Fifteen subjects were treated with other immunosuppressive agents, either instead of or in addition to prednisone. Eight of this latter group responded to therapy, 6 of whom responded to cyclophosphamide. The study suggested that the lymphocyte proportion in BAL fluid was important in predicting response to prednisone. The study failed to provide any more details of clinical, radiological or physiological outcomes, nor did it distinguish between patients with pulmonary fibrosis confined to the lung and those with other features of connective tissue disease.</P>

Patients were "usually" started on a combination of 3 drugs: prednisolone at 40 to 50 mg/day, tapering to 10 to 20 mg/day over 4 to 8 weeks; D-penicillamine at 300 mg/day, increasing by 300 mg weekly to a maximum dosage of 3.6 g/day for 6 months, then 1.8 g/day for 6 months; and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide at 2 to 3 mg/kg/day. Outcome was assessed in terms of improvement in VC and PaO<SUB>2</SUB>. Many required cessation of D-penicillamine due to side effects, but this was not recorded in a systematic fashion. There was no randomisation or blinding procedure in the protocol and no control group was incorporated into the study design.</P>
<P>6/15 were treated with prednisolone alone: one improved, "half of them" deteriorated and the rest remained stable. 4/15 were treated with prednisolone and D-penicillamine, with 3 remaining stable and the other improving. The group treated with prednisolone and azathioprine (6/15) showed improvement in 4/6 with only one worsening. Combined therapy with 3 drugs produced a significant number of side effects. This seems to have been predominantly due to D-penicillamine and cyclophosphamide. Azathioprine seemed to have been the best tolerated agent.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that the combination of azathioprine and prednisolone represented the best approach to therapy.</P>
<P>8/15 patients had serological evidence of a connective tissue disorder (Anti-nuclear antibodies [ANA], or rheumatoid factor [RhF]). Good histological verification of the diagnosis was only available in 8/15 and therapy appears to have been introduced or discontinued on an "ad hoc" basis.

<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1987</LINK>. In this non-randomised, prospective open-label parallel trial, patients with IPF referred to the Pulmonary Branch of NHLBI, Bethesda were enrolled into 4 study groups to receive one of 3 interventions; corticosteroids alone, cyclophosphamide alone or both corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Allocation to groups depended upon the results of an initial BAL. The study was designed to investigate the potential pharmacological modulation of the neutrophil component of the alveolitis seen in IPF. The patients had been previously diagnosed with IPF by (unspecified) "previously defined criteria". All were regarded as being in the "mid-course" of their disease. Patients enrolled in each group had a similar duration of disease. No other clinical information was provided.</P>
<P>The 4 study groups were:<BR/>Group 1. Untreated patients with a neutrophil count greater than 10% of total BAL cells. Treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, then tapering by 5 mg every 10 days to a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the trial.<BR/>Group 2. Untreated patients with a neutrophil count of less than 10% of total cells. Treated with prednisone as in group 1.<BR/>Group 3. Untreated patients with a neutrophil count greater than 10% of total cells. Treated with cyclophosphamide 1.5 mg/kg/day.<BR/>Group 4. Patients with a greater than 10% neutrophil count despite prednisone therapy (0.25 mg/kg/day) for at least 3 months. Treated with cyclophosphamide in similar doses to group 3 in addition to continuing prednisone.</P>
<P>Evaluation comprised repeat BAL at 3 and 6 months. Mean proportions of neutrophils at each stage were compared to baseline values.</P>
<P>Group 1 and 2 patients showed no significant change in BAL neutrophil proportions at 3 or 6 months. Group 3 patients showed a significant decrease in neutrophil proportions from baseline at 3 months, a change that was sustained at 6 months. This fall was also seen in Group 4 following the administration of cyclophosphamide. There were no significant complications associated with cyclophosphamide use in groups 3 and 4. There was no significant change in lung function in any of the study groups.</P>
<P>The study showed a significant change in neutrophil proportions in BAL fluid in the 2 groups treated with cyclophosphamide. From the limited data presented it would appear that this was not accompanied by any change in respiratory function or clinical status.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: The study was excluded as it failed to provide data for any of the desired primary outcomes. It is possible that subjects in the 4 study groups were not adequately matched as it is unclear as to why some patients were already on corticosteroid therapy. The description of patients as being in "mid-course" suggests that the subjects in this study may have been less severely affected by their disease at the time of enrolment than those in some other studies. There was no placebo or true control group included for comparison.<BR/>

Twenty-six subjects had IPF and the remaining 6 also suffered from associated connective tissue disorders. Histological confirmation of the presence of "CFA" was obtained in 27/32. Six subjects were on immunosuppressive therapy at study commencement and an additional 20 were started on treatment during the course of the study, 15 subjects received prednisolone and 11 received cyclophosphamide. Of this latter group 5 had already failed to respond to prednisolone and 6 were started on cyclophosphamide de novo. 16/32 were also involved in a prospective randomised trial of high-dose prednisolone versus low-dose prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, subsequently described in <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>.

All patients had previously received treatment in both arms of another therapeutic trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>) with high-dose prednisolone (60 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide (100 to 120 mg/day). Some had also received D-penicillamine or azathioprine and all had deteriorated while on such therapy. Cyclosporin was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. The mean duration of symptoms prior to commencement of cyclosporin was 3.9 years (range 1.5 to 9). Mean DLCO at commencement was 17% of predicted (no SD given). It is unclear whether and at what point other immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued. A control group of 7 patients matched for sex, age, duration of disease, lung function (mean DLCO 18%) and histology and who had been similarly treated with high-dose prednisolone and cyclophosphamide was used for the purposes of comparison. It is unclear whether treatment in this group was continued. "Baseline" values for PFTs were taken from tests performed 3 and 6 months prior to the commencement of cyclosporin.</P>
<P>Subjects were followed with monthly dyspnoea assessment, CXR and lung function. A change greater than 15% in FEV1, FVC or DLCO from the previous recording was considered to be significant. It is unclear whether standardised validated scoring scales were used for assessment of dyspnoea or CXR changes.</P>
<P>Three subjects were excluded from analysis, 2 due to super-added bronchogenic carcinoma discovered at post-mortem, and one due to drug intolerance. Six of the remaining 7 reported either an improvement or no change in dyspnoea after one month; 3 out of 7 showed a 15% improvement in PFTs at 1 month and CXRs showed no substantial change. These improvements were not sustained and all patients subsequently progressively declined in all outcome measures. Mean survival for treated patients was 5 months and 2.5 months for the control group. This difference was not statistically significant. It is not clear whether the 3 patients otherwise excluded from analysis were included in this outcome. Nine out of 10 subjects developed side effects from the cyclosporin. One patient was temporarily withdrawn from the trial due to the development of renal impairment which resolved following the cessation of cyclosporin. Although not explicitly stated it is assumed that the patient was then re-entered in the trial. Another subject stopped treatment and withdrew from the trial after 7 days due to side effects (facial flushing).</P>
<P>The authors concluded that the initial response to cyclosporin was encouraging and that this was unlikely to be due to a placebo effect. Survival time was doubled, a finding considered to be of potential significance for patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation for IPF. The subjects were at a very late stage of the disease process and it was felt that any substantial improvement would be unlikely. It was felt that therapy initiated earlier or in less severe disease may prove more effective.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: Insufficient data was provided to enable statistical assessment. There is some concern that the trial was not truly prospective as some baseline data appears to have been retrospectively collected. With regard to the survival analysis it is unclear as to whether the 3 otherwise excluded subjects were included in this calculation (e.g. on an intention-to-treat basis).<BR/>

This study was a retrospective review of 10 patients with progressive symptomatic interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology who were treated with cyclosporin A. Five of the 10 had histological features consistent with IPF and the other five had an atypical progressive restrictive lung disease which could not be classified precisely. Of those patients considered to have IPF, 1 also had mixed connective disease. Four of this group were on prednisone and 1 was additionally on cyclophosphamide. The fifth patient was untreated. Those on therapy were deteriorating despite treatment. The second group of patients had a histological pattern that was not consistent with a diagnosis of IPF, being a cellular, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrative process with minimal fibrosis. They are not described here in detail.</P>
<P>All subjects were treated with prednisone at 20 mg/day and cyclosporin A at 7 mg/kg/day for 8 to 10 weeks. Doses were then gradually reduced to 10 mg/day of prednisone and 3 mg/kg/day of cyclosporin. The combined treatment continued for 6 to 47 months (median 22). Clinical progress was monitored monthly, with FBC, LFTs, electrolytes, urea, creatinine and PFTs. CXRs were performed after 3 months and thereafter at 6-monthly intervals. Response was assessed by changes in symptomatology using New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria and by PFTs. A 10% change in pulmonary function was considered to be significant.</P>
<P>8/10 patients showed an improvement in symptoms or lung function, 3 of these were from the IPF group. Of the IPF group 2 died from infection, possibly contributed to by immunosuppression, one failed to respond to any immunosuppressive agent and died within a year, one relapsed after 11 months on combination treatment, then stabilised with the addition of azathioprine, and finally 1 developed severe and resistant hypertension necessitating the withdrawal of combination therapy after 17 months with subsequent relapse of IPF.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether any of the observed responses seen were due to cyclosporin or prednisone, although 4/5 had previously deteriorated whilst on prednisone. Toxic effects possibly due to cyclosporin were not infrequent in the study group.</P>

The subjects had either worsening disease or contraindications to corticosteroids. All had clinical features and PFTs consistent with IPF, 16/33 had HRCT scans, the results of which showed changes consistent with IPF; 2 had OLB and 1 a post-mortem biopsy all confirming IPF.</P>
<P>The chosen intervention was intravenous cyclophosphamide given second-weekly at an initial dose of 500 mg, escalating if WBC remained above 3000 per cubic millimetre to a maximum of 1000 to 1800 mg. Corticosteroid therapy was tapered as tolerated. If pulmonary function remained stable over a 4-month period then cyclophosphamide was given every 3 weeks.</P>
<P>Subjects were treated for at least 6 months or until death. The 18-month probability of survival was greater than 50%. For those surviving 6 months (24) there was a significant rise in VC from 1.6 +/- 0.61L (SD) to 1.8 +/- 0.52 L (P &lt; 0.01) which persisted for at least 8 months. There was an associated significant fall in average prednisone dose from 32 +/- 13.0 mg to 4 +/- 10.4 mg (P &lt; 0.01) by 12 months. 14/17 patients had discontinued prednisone by 12 months. Only 3/10 continued to receive prednisone at 18 months. Cyclophosphamide was considered to be well-tolerated. One patient required hospitalisation due to possible drug toxicity.</P>
<P>Three patients withdrew after 12 months. Thirteen died while receiving cyclophosphamide, 9 within 6 months. There were 11 deaths from respiratory failure, One from pulmonary malignancy and 1 from unrelated cardiac disease. "Early death" patients received significantly higher prednisone doses than survivors (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>The study authors concluded that intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy was associated with improved pulmonary function and reduced corticosteroid use in patients with IPF who survived 6 months after the institution of therapy.

At recruitment 18 were receiving no immunosuppressive therapy, 14 were on corticosteroids and 7 were on cyclophosphamide. Excess longitudinal declines in TLC were significantly associated with severe dyspnoea and cyclophosphamide therapy. Excess longitudinal declines in DLCO were significantly associated with moderate to severe dyspnoea, cyclophosphamide treatment, higher pack-years of cigarette smoking and higher BAL eosinophil concentrations.

A retrospective study that attempted to analyse the determinants of response to immunosuppressive therapy with either prednisone alone or with prednisone and cyclophosphamide in subjects with IPF. A group of 25 consecutive subjects with histologically confirmed IPF were reviewed. All were treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) after initial evaluation. Follow up was at 3-monthly intervals. Patients who failed to improve with prednisone at any 3-monthly review had cyclophosphamide added to their treatment. (100 mg/day). Response to treatment was defined as at least 10% improvement in FVC and/or DLCO from baseline 12 and 24 months after the commencement of therapy.</P>
<P>12/25 were considered to be responders at 24 months, 6/12 responding to prednisone alone, the other 6 to a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide, the cyclophosphamide being started after 6 or 9 months (mean 7+/- 1.4 months[SEM?]).</P>
<P>Of the 13 non-responders, 3 were commenced upon both prednisone and cyclophosphamide at the outset, 8 had cyclophosphamide added and 2 remained on prednisone alone (although this violated the treatment protocol).</P>
<P>A short duration of disease (less than 12 months) was related to response to therapy. Assessment (&gt; 10% increase in FVC) after 3 months treatment was predictive of sustained response. Cyclophosphamide appeared to be of benefit only in those who initially responded to corticosteroids. Patients with an initial FVC of greater than 90% were subsequently excluded from the analysis. With these excluded, responders appeared to have a lower initial FVC than non-responders.</P>
<P>The authors considered that (1) a short symptomatic period increased the likelihood of a response, (2) early assessment of changes in FVC predicted likelihood of response to therapy and that (3) a short-lived early response to corticosteroids could be sustained by the addition of cyclophosphamide.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Douglas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 1997</LINK>. This retrospective case review assessed the results of therapy with colchicine and prednisone as single agents. Medical records were reviewed to identify patients treated initially with either colchicine or prednisone. Patients were included if they had appropriate clinical findings, CXRs, PFT results and either HRCT scans showing typical changes of UIP/IPF or OLB specimens with changes of UIP. They were also required to have had at least 1 follow-up PFT within 2 years of diagnosis. They were excluded if there was a lack of characteristic x-ray or histological findings, if UIP was due to a specific cause, if initial treatment was with combination therapy, if additional drugs were added before a follow-up PFT was performed, if there was no follow-up PFT within 2 years or if there was documented drug intolerance necessitating discontinuation of therapy before the first follow-up PFT.</P>
<P>The colchicine group comprised 22 patients who met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria (out of a total 98 treated with colchicine at the Mayo Clinic), who were then compared with 22 patients from a group of 102 undergoing OLB at the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 1985 and previously coded as having histological evidence of IPF. These 102 specimens were reviewed and reclassified according to current guidelines. A total of 80 were excluded, 35 as review showed pathology other than UIP, 33 with inadequate follow up, 5 with prior therapy, 4 with non-diagnostic specimens, 2 with clinical evidence of disease other than IPF and 1 due to dual initial therapy. Two colchicine treated patients were also included in another study from the same institution (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparisons were made between the colchicine treated group and their historical prednisone treated counterparts. Time to treatment failure was defined as the interval in months between baseline PFTs and the first follow-up study to show a significant decline from baseline, 15% for FVC and 20% for DLCO. Follow-up was considered to end without PFT failure when a second drug was added to the regimen before documented PFT failure occurred. Patients remaining on monotherapy and without PFT failure were classified as non-failures when follow up ended at the last PFT. Follow up for all cases ended at 2 years due to inadequate further data.</P>
<P>There were significant differences at baseline between the 2 groups for the numbers undergoing OLB and HRCT, reflecting changes in clinical practice and available technology; and in year of baseline PFT, reflecting the historical nature of one group. There were no significant differences in demographics or baseline PFTs between groups. There was no significant difference between colchicine and prednisone groups for changes between baseline and first subsequent PFT. There was no significant difference in rate of change in PFTs over the follow-up period between the 2 groups. Failure curves for either FVC or DLCO, FVC alone and DLCO alone showed no significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>In a combined total of 25 patients (11 prednisone, 14 colchicine) there was no significant decline in pulmonary function. There was no significant difference in duration of follow up. Sustained improvement was considered difficult to assess as patients whose condition declined tended to drop-out. No statistical comparison was given. Frequency of complications was also felt difficult to compare and again no statistical comparison was given.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of decline of pulmonary function between groups. A trend towards more rapid decline with prednisone was suggested by the failure curves. There were a number of acknowledged problems with the study. Diagnosis was based on different criteria in the different historical epochs chosen. Only a small number of patients in the clinic registry had adequate follow-up data to allow for inclusion, possibly producing bias, as was the method of selection of patients.</P>
<P>Other, unrecognised criticisms of the study include the possibility that the disease itself has changed. Incidence is believed to be rising (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2000</LINK>) and the nature of the disease itself may have altered (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1998</LINK>). Other demographic considerations not explored in the published study include race, geographical location of patients and other environmental factors (air pollution, work exposure and practices etc) and differing patterns of possible predisposing infections (Hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus etc (<LINK REF="REF-Egan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 1997</LINK>)) all of which could affect the validity of the comparison. No non-treatment comparison was made in either period. It is not known whether the results from either prednisone or colchicine differed significantly in any way from no therapy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kolb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kolb 1998</LINK> investigated the effects of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in the management of IPF. The study retrospectively reviewed 18 patients with progressive IPF treated for 1 year with iv cyclophosphamide. Diagnosis was based upon clinical, x-ray and TBB findings in 13, with OLB in the other 5. Patients who had previously failed therapy with oral prednisolone were given an initial dose of 500 mg of cyclophosphamide iv, increased by 100 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 1000 to 1300 mg (15 mg/kg). This dose was given monthly for 1 year along with uro-protective adjuvant therapy with mesna. They were also given oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day, tapering after 6 weeks. After one year treatment was changed to oral prednisolone alone.</P>
<P>One patient was withdrawn from the study due to recurrent pneumonia. At one year, 6/17 showed improvement, 5/17 were stable, (all classified as "responders") and 6/17 had deteriorated. There was no significant difference in PFTs between groups after 1 year. Oral prednisolone dose was significantly reduced in all patients after one year, but dosage in the non-responder subgroup was not significantly reduced. The therapeutic benefit appeared to last for at least 3 months after ceasing cyclophosphamide. Seven patients died after starting cyclophosphamide therapy. Five died within 4 months of commencing pulse therapy although this was attributed to rapid disease progression rather than the agent. One subject died from pneumonia to which cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression may have contributed.</P>
<P>The authors claimed to have arrested the disease process in 11/17 patients with the use of intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide and oral prednisolone. Long-term cyclophosphamide-related toxicity was apparently minimal and the drug was well-tolerated.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: The trial was an uncontrolled and non-randomised study and as such failed to meet the the inclusion criteria.

<P>56 patients with clinical, x-ray and functional features of ILD and a biopsy proven diagnosis of IPF were enrolled between 1983 and 1990 from clinics at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Mexico. None had previously been treated with immunosuppressive agents.<BR/>Patients were allocated to one of 4 treatment groups.</P>
<P>Interventions were:<BR/>(1) prednisone alone (15 patients)<BR/>(2) colchicine and prednisone (19)<BR/>(3) D-penicillamine and prednisone (11)<BR/>(4) D-penicillamine, colchicine and prednisone (11)</P>
<P>Prednisone was commenced at 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month, followed by a taper biweekly to a maintenance dose of 15 mg/day. Colchicine was given at a dose of 1.0 mg daily and D-penicillamine 600 mg daily. Follow up was for 5 years, initially at 1 and 3 months, thereafter at 3-monthly intervals for 2 years and 6-monthly after that. Outcomes followed were changes in dyspnoea scores, PFT results (TLC and VC), resting arterial blood gas analysis and survival. All ABG testing was performed at an altitude of 2240 m and a mean barometric pressure of 583 mmHg. Appropriate methods of statistical analysis were used for continuous and categorical data. No details of the reasons for or the methods of allocation of patients to particular groups were provided.</P>
<P>Group 4 contained a significantly younger population (46 +/- 11 years) than groups 1 (55 +/- 10 years) or 2 (55 +/- 15 years) (P &lt; 0.05). There were no other significant differences between groups at baseline.</P>
<P>Five patients were lost to follow up, 13 died in the first 2 years and 29 were dead by the 5-year follow-up date. Comparison of survival curves showed no significant differences between groups. Women displayed a higher rate of mortality than men (23/36 versus 6/20, P &lt; 0.02). Age did not appear to be a prognostic factor.</P>
<P>Results of PFTs at 2 years showed no significant difference either within or between any of the groups but there was a non-significant trend to improvement in PFTs in several groups (all results +/- SD):</P>

<P>It is possible that the apparent improvement in PFTs after 2 years is due to a survivor effect, with the sicker patients (presumably with poorer lung function) dying during those first 2 years (13/56). Prednisone related side effects were common (90%) and more severe than those due to the other study medications which were well tolerated.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that neither colchicine or D-penicillamine contributed to a better clinical response than prednisone alone. This may reflect the relatively advanced stage of IPF seen in the study population (FVC &lt; 50%). There was a significant difference in mean age between some of the groups at baseline, notably group 4. Those in this group were on all 3 study agents suggesting that they may have been deliberately placed in that group on the basis of age, possibly in the hope of a better outcome. Whilst the authors did not consider that this affected their study, other authors (<LINK REF="STD-Raghu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Raghu 1991</LINK>) have found that when adjusted for age, a Cox regression model showed a significant survival advantage for azathioprine. It is possible that an age adjusted effect may have been present in this trial.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: The study was an open-label, non-randomised trial and as such failed to meet the inclusion criteria. No details were given regarding the details of patient assignment for each group and the suspicion must be that allocation may have been on the grounds of age or other factors. There are therefore concerns about the degree of generalisability or reproducibility of the study outcomes<BR/>

Pirfenidone is a pyridone molecule shown to inhibit TGF-beta in vitro and which appears to be effective in experimental animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with progressive deterioration despite therapy with prednisone with or without immunosuppressive agents or those unwilling or unable to tolerate conventional therapy were considered for inclusion. Diagnosis was based upon the presence of typical clinical, radiological and histological features on OLB of IPF. Patients over 65 with typical features were also included if a TBB specimen excluded the presence of malignancy, vasculitis, granuloma or infection. Other causes for deterioration were excluded as were other possible causes for pulmonary fibrosis.</P>
<P>Chosen study endpoints were OS and measurable change in lung function after 12 months of therapy. A significant change was defined as a 10% change in FVC or TLC or a 20% change in DLCO.</P>
<P>Pirfenidone was introduced over a period of 15 days, gradually increasing to a dose of 40 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 3600 mg in divided doses. Study medication was continued as long as the subject remained in the trial. Immunosuppressive therapy was stopped on day 1 and prednisone tapered off over 6 to 8 weeks. Patients were not allowed to take concurrent medications used in IPF (e.g. colchicine). Follow up was weekly for 2 weeks, monthly for 3 months, then 3-monthly. Appropriate statistical techniques were used in the evaluation of outcomes.</P>
<P>There were 54 subjects, 42 with IPF confirmed by OLB, 8 with clinical features and a compatible TBB and 4 on clinical and radiological features alone. There was no control group. Fourty one were able to complete PFTs at 6 months and 31 at 12 months. The rest had either died or were unable to complete such tests. One-year survival was 78% (95% CI 66% to 89%), 2-year survival 63% (95% CI 50% to 76%). Three patients underwent lung transplantation and were removed from further follow up.</P>
<P>38/46 patients on prednisone were able to cease therapy and the other 8 were all able to reduce their dose. All 32 patients on immunosuppressive agents were able to discontinue these.</P>
<P>In those able to be tested at 6 (41/54) and 12 months (31/54) the mean FVC and TLC stabilised after study entry. There was insufficient data to assess changes in DLCO accurately. Similarly, oxygen saturation remained stable during follow up. The apparent stability may had been due to a survivor effect.</P>
<P>At 6 months 29 had stabilised or improved FVC and 12 had deteriorated, 17 had established or improved TLC and 7 had deteriorated, 6 had died before 6 months and PFTs were not available for the remainder. At 1 year 22 had stable or improved FVC and 9 had deteriorated, 15 had stabilised or improved TLC and 8 had deteriorated, 20 had stable or improved DLCO and 7 had deteriorated.</P>
<P>Overall there was a total of 12 deaths and one lung transplantation. DLCO less than 30%, age greater than 65 and male sex were associated with decreased survival.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal side effects were common (64%) but only 2 patients had sufficiently severe symptoms to warrant discontinuation. Photosensitive skin reactions were also common (24%) and four (8%) discontinued therapy for this reason.

<LINK REF="STD-Douglas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 2000</LINK> was a retrospective review of all patients with pulmonary fibrosis seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, between 1994 and 1996. It followed on from previous studies that suggested a trend towards better outcome with colchicine when compared to high-dose prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Douglas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Douglas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1993</LINK>). This study assessed survival as a function of the different treatment programmes, on an intention-to-treat basis. All patients were considered to have IPF/UIP on clinical, radiological and/or histological criteria.</P>
<P>A total of 1901 patients with pulmonary fibrosis were identified, 34% of whom were considered to have IPF/UIP (581 patients). Treatment commenced at initial assessment was: none in 157 (32.2%), prednisone alone in 54 (11.1%), colchicine alone in 167 (34.3%), colchicine and prednisone in 71 (14.6%) and other treatments in 38 (7.8%). Oxygen therapy was also recommended in 133 (27.7%). Two hundred and fifty of these patients had received no drug therapy prior to their first Mayo Clinic visit (51.3%), 202 (41.5%) had previously received prednisone, 70 (14.4%) colchicine, 30 (6.2%) cyclophosphamide, 9 (1.8%) azathioprine, 3 (0.6%) hydroxychloroquine, one (0.2%) methotrexate and 3 (0.6%) received other unspecified agents. In 125 (25.3%) only prednisone had been used and only colchicine in 24 (4.9%). Seventy-four (15.6%) had previously received oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>Median survival was 3.2 years from the index visit, or 3.8 years if the initial diagnosis was made at the first visit. Univariate analysis showed survival was worse with increasing age, male sex, patient referral for interstitial lung disease, progressive disease as assessed by symptoms, CXR or pulmonary function, lower values of VC, VA, DLCO or resting SaO<SUB>2</SUB> and with previous treatment with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or oxygen. Survival was worse for those commenced on prednisone alone or prednisone and colchicine when compared to those in whom no therapy was advised.</P>
<P>Multivariate analysis also showed that older age, male sex, lower DLCO and VA, and evidence of disease progression on PFTs were all associated with a worse prognosis. After adjusting for age, sex, DLCO, VA and disease progression by PFT, there was no evidence to indicate that survival was associated with recommended pharmacological or oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that there was no evidence that colchicine had any additional benefit over no therapy in the treatment of IPF/UIP. They also found no evidence that maintenance therapy with prednisone produced any survival benefit. Colchicine appeared to be better tolerated than high-dose prednisone.</P>

<P>Patients had clinical and investigational features consistent with IPF. Patients were excluded if they were found to have a disease other than IPF. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline and at 3 months after the commencement of steroids and after 6 months or at discontinuation of cyclophosphamide therapy. Clinical severity was assessed using a 0 (best) to 100 (worst) point composite clinical radiographic and physiologic score (CRP score). HRCT were scored on a 0 to 5-point scale. All patients underwent bronchoscopy with BAL and TBB before undergoing OLB.</P>
<P>All patients were commenced on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 3 months. Changes in CRP score at 3 months were used to assess response. Responders, non-responders and stable individuals were identified. Non-responders, stable patients and those unable to tolerate high-dose steroids were commenced upon cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day for a 6-month trial of therapy. Prednisone was tapered over 4 weeks. Changes in CRP score were used to assess response to cyclophosphamide. Nine patients were unable to complete the exercise component of the CRP assessment and their progress was assessed by changes to TLC, FVC, DLCO or pulse oximetry.</P>
<P>Nineteen patients were enrolled in the study. All had UIP on OLB. Only one patient showed a significant improvement on the CRP score after 6 months of therapy. Seven remained stable, and this stability persisted after cyclophosphamide was stopped. Eleven patients were classified as non-responders to cyclophosphamide. After long-term follow up (4.2 +/- 0.4 years), 7 patients had died, all cyclophosphamide non-responders. This group appeared to have more severe disease, as assessed by baseline CRP score, HRCT and lung function findings. 68% (13) exhibited toxicity to cyclophosphamide, necessitating cessation in 9.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that cyclophosphamide therapy was of limited efficacy in patients with IPF who failed to respond to prednisone. There was a high incidence of side effects, often necessitating discontinuation of therapy.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: The trial was an uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomised study. As such it failed to meet the inclusion criteria. The CRP score that was used in patient assessment does not appear to be in widespread use and its external validity is uncertain. It is uncertain how generalisable the study findings are. The study population may have been heterogeneous.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Douglas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Douglas 2001</LINK> was a retrospective clinical record review of 487 patients with IPF confirmed by OLB or HRCT between 1994 and 1996. Survival was assessed as a function of the intention-to-treat at the time of initial clinic visit. Univariate analysis showed that survival was significantly worse for patients treated with prednisone than no therapy and for those receiving oxygen compared to no oxygen.</P>
<P>On multivariate analysis, reduced survival was associated with male sex, increasing age, lower DLCO, lower alveolar volume and a history of worsening pulmonary function. When these factors were also included in a multivariate analysis there was no significant difference in patients treated with prednisone or colchicine when compared to no therapy. Similarly, there was no difference between oxygen users and non-users in the multivariate model.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: This was an open-label, uncontrolled retrospective study which meant that this trial failed to meet the inclusion criteria. In addition it was only published in abstract form and lacked statistical detail.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Xaubet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Xaubet 2001</LINK>. This Spanish study prospectively examined the clinical course of untreated patients with IPF compared to those treated in an open-label, non-randomised prospective clinical trial utilising a variety of therapeutic interventions. Forty-three previously untreated patients with IPF were enrolled over 3 years. There were 31 men, the mean age was 66 years (SEM 1, range 47 to 88). Twelve were current smokers, 6 ex-smokers of at least 5 years standing and 25 lifelong non-smokers. Dyspnoea was present in 38/43 with a mean duration of symptoms of 12 months (SEM 2, range 1 to 36). All patients had IPF/UIP as defined by current clinical criteria and 18/43 (42%) had the diagnosis confirmed by OLB. Patients undergoing OLB were significantly younger than the remainder of the study population.</P>
<P>PFTs including TLC and DLCO were performed. Fifteen patients also underwent an exercise test to determine symptom-limited exercise capacity. 42/43 patients underwent HRCT. This was scored for the extent of parenchymal abnormalities using predefined criteria by 2 radiologists blinded to other patient data. These data was subjected to semi-quantitative analysis. BAL was also conducted although the results were not presented in any detail. Progression was defined as an increase in dyspnoea and/or &lt; 15% fall in FVC and/or DLCO. Response to therapy was defined as improvement in dyspnoea and/or &gt; 15% improvement in FVC and DLCO. Follow up with PFTs and CXR was performed at 3-monthly intervals or with clinical evidence of disease progression.</P>
<P>Treatment was initiated at diagnosis if the patient indicated a marked increase in dyspnoea over 12 months. Initial treatment was with oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day for 1 month), tapering by 10 mg every 2 weeks to a maintenance dose of 20 mg every second day. Azathioprine or cyclophosphamide were added in the presence of disease progression or steroid side effects.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine patients received treatment at diagnosis (Group I). Twenty-six were followed up for 24 +/- 4 months with 3 lost to follow up. Serial PFTs were available for 19, the other 7 being too sick to perform repeated PFTs. Eleven patients were commenced upon azathioprine (3 mg/kg/day) or cyclophosphamide (100 -150 mg/day) during the study at a mean time of 16 +/- 3 months. 13/26 died during the study, at a mean of 11 +/- 4 months after diagnosis; 10 due to disease progression, infection in 2 and pulmonary embolism in 1. Overall 9 progressed, 5 were stable and 5 improved.</P>
<P>Group II patients (14 subjects) received no immediate treatment. Follow up was of 13 patients for 23 +/- 3 months with 1 being lost to follow up. 8/13 were commenced upon therapy during the course of the study either with corticosteroids alone (7 patients) or corticosteroids and azathioprine (1 patient). All patients demonstrated a significant fall in FVC and/or DLCO before therapy was initiated. Treatment was initiated at a mean of 12 +/- 3 months after diagnosis. The other 6 patients remained stable during a follow-up period of 19 +/- 4 months (15% of all study patients). It is not known whether these 6 differed in any way from the other patients in Group II although the authors report no difference in "clinical, radiographical and HRCT findings". There were no deaths in Group II.</P>
<P>There were significant differences between the 2 groups at diagnosis. Group I patients were significantly more dyspnoeic, had a lower FVC and a greater extent of ground-glass opacity on HRCT than those in Group II. As these were the criteria for inclusion in Group I this finding is not unexpected. Group I patients had more severe disease at the onset of the study, although there was no evidence that the duration of symptomatic disease was any longer. There were no significant differences in duration of preceding symptomatic disease or other clinical and investigational findings.</P>
<P>The authors appeared to identify a subgroup of patients with "stable" or non-progressive IPF. How these patients differed from those who initially required no treatment but who later developed progressive disease is not known. The relatively short follow-up period may explain the apparent stability and a longer duration of follow up may have changed this finding. It is also not known whether any of the Group I patients would have remained stable without intervention.</P>
<P>Reasons for exclusion: The study was a non-randomised, open-label prospective trial with significant differences between the "control" group (Group II) and the initial treatment arm. As such it failed to meet the inclusion criteria.<BR/>

In this study the authors reviewed the clinical records, radiological features, and pulmonary function data of 21 patients treated with interferon gamma-1beta (200 &#956;g administered subcutaneously 3 times a week). Mean duration of treatment was 8.2 months. While one patient only showed symptomatic and functional improvement, 7 discontinued treatment because of a perceived lack of benefit. Furthermore, 11 patients (52%) died after a mean of 6.4 months of treatment, and follow-up pulmonary function data suggested continued worsening in all but one patient.

<LINK REF="STD-Collard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collard 2004</LINK>. This study retrospectively assessed whether combined corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy improves survival in patients with IPF. One hundred and sixty-four patients (82 treated and 82 untreated) matched by age at diagnosis (within 5 years) and baseline FVC % (within 5%) were included in the study. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids (initial starting dose 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day of oral prednisone or its equivalent) with the addition of oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day with a total dose &lt; 200 mg/day). Corticosteroids were tapered to lower doses after several weeks and continued for at least 6 months and commonly 12 months. No survival difference was found between patients who were treated (median survival: 1431 days) or untreated (median survival: 1665 days; P = 0.58).

<LINK REF="STD-Nadrous-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nadrous 2004</LINK>.<B> </B>This study retrospectively evaluated whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) improved survival of patients with IPF. The rationale of the study was that ACEI and statins have been shown to have antifibrotic properties in experimental models both in vitro and in vivo. Of 478 consecutive patients with IPF seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1994 through 1996, 52 (11%) received ACEI, 35 (7%) received statins, and 5 (1%) received both. Patients were on ACEI or statins for cardiovascular indications and lipid-lowering purposes.</P>
<P>For subjects receiving ACEI, the median survival from the index visit was 2.2 years, compared to 2.9 years for subjects not receiving ACEI (P = 0.088), while the median survival was 2.9 years irrespective of whether patients were receiving statins or not (P = 0.573).

<LINK REF="STD-Kondoh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kondoh 2005</LINK>. This study evaluated the efficacy of cyclophosphamide combined with low-dose prednisolone in patients with IPF (n = 27) as compared with patients with idiopathic fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 12). All patients were treated for 4 weeks with intermittent iv high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g<B>/</B>day for 3 days at 1-week intervals), followed by combination therapy for 1 year with cyclophosphamide (1 to 2 mg<B>/</B>day) plus low-dose prednisolone (20 mg on alternate days). After 1 year of combination therapy, 4 of 27 patients (15%) with IPF showed functional improvement (&#8805; 10% increase in VC % predicted), 14 (52%) remained unchanged, and 9 (33%) had worsened - which did not significantly differed from pre-treatment baseline data (70.8 ± 15.5% versus 72.1 ± 17.3%: P = 0.52). On the other hand, in the fibrosing NSIP group, 8 of 12 patients had improved, 4 remained unchanged, and none had worsened (56.7 ± 12.7% versus 77.2 ± 16.1%; P = 0.001). Median survival of IPF patients was 4.1 years, significantly worse than that of fibrosing NSIP patients (P = 0.002).</P>
<P>Adverse events attributable to cyclophosphamide - e.g. haemorrhagic cystitis, leukopenia, myelodysplastic syndrome, herpes zoster, alopecia and aspergilloma - were reported by 8 patients, with 5 (13%) requiring discontinuation of treatment.</P>

<P>This study had no pre-specified end-points. In the intention-to-treat population, 5/32 (16%) patients in the interferon gamma-1beta arm and 7/18 (39%) in the colchicine arm died after a median follow-up period of 25 months (P = 0.028). The hazard ratio for death in the interferon gamma-1beta group, compared with the colchicine group, was 0.30 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.86). In addition, 62% of patients in the interferon gamma-1beta arm had improved or stable disease compared with 17% in the colchicine arm (P = 0.014) after 24 months of therapy. Furthermore, the interferon gamma-1beta group exhibited a higher FVC % predicted at 24 months (P = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in resting arterial oxygen tension, TLC % predicted, DLCO % predicted and disease progression by HRCT patterns between the 2 treatment groups.
