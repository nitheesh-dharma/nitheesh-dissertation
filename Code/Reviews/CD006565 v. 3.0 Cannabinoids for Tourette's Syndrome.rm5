<P>Cannabinoid medication might be useful in the treatment of the symptoms in patients with Tourette's syndrome. At the present time only two relevant studies have been conducted. Both studies used tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC). In both studies &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC was associated with tic reduction. However the sample size was small and a large number of multiple comparisons were made . There were only 28 participants in total, since eight participants took part in both studies. Possibly the patients who derived the greatest benefit and experienced the least adverse effects would be the most inclined to participate in further studies. There were a high number of drop outs/exclusions in the six week study and it is unclear whether intention to treat analysis (ITT) was performed. The results that are reported are analyses done on the patients who remained in the study on the study medication at the correct dose. In reality, patients do opt not to continue treatment if there is limited efficacy or unpalatable side effects. This introduces attrition bias. Whilst there were some significant results, the authors themselves accept that very few of these results are significant if a Bonferroni correction is performed. It is possible that cannabinoid medication has a beneficial effect which is too weak to be detected using ITT and such a small sample size. There is some weak evidence that cannabinoid medication may have an effect on obsessive compulsive behaviour but the measure used was an addition to the TSSL which has not been validated.There were no data on the effect of &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC on quality of life.There is not enough evidence to support the use of cannabinoids in treating tics and obsessive compulsive behaviour in people with Tourette's syndrome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-31 16:21:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by the presence of chronic motor and phonic tics. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (<LINK REF="REF-DSM-1V-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM 1V 1994</LINK>) GTS is characterised by multiple motor and one or more vocal tics lasting more than a year, with an onset before the age of 18. Tics are recurrent, semivoluntary, brief movements that affect multiple muscle groups. Motor tics can be simple, rapidly executed movements or complex slower movements which appear more purposeful. Phonic tics can also be simple: consisting of meaningless sounds and noises such as grunts or sniffs, or complex: with linguistically meaningful utterances that can include coprolalia (an uncontrollable use of obscene language), echolalia (mechanical and meaningless repetition of the words of another person), or palilalia (words being rapidly and involuntarily repeated). Tics can be embarrassing or even painful to execute. Many patients with GTS experience a premonitory sensation preceding a tic, which is associated with an almost irresistible urge to perform the tic. There may be an overwhelming compulsion to do the same action a certain number of times, until it feels 'just right'. Tics vary in intensity over a period of weeks and months. In many cases they are associated with behavioural difficulties, which can include attention problems, motor hyperactivity, obsessive compulsive behaviours, lack of impulse control, anxiety, depression and self-injurious behaviour. The symptoms of GTS can be mild, moderate or severe according to their frequency, intensity and the degree to which they impair daily life.<BR/>
</P>
<P>It is important that treatment is individualised on the basis of the functional impairment caused by tics and the associated comorbid conditions. Medication should be reserved only for those problems that are functionally disabling and which are unable to be remedied by non-drug interventions. Some randomised controlled trials have shown that haloperidol and pimozide can be effective in reducing tics in many patients for much of the time (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1989</LINK>). However, only 20% to 30% of patients taking haloperidol or pimozide continue with the treatment owing to intolerable adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chappell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappell 1995</LINK>). The newer atypical neuroleptics show fewer adverse effects and of these, risperidone has been the most extensively studied.Risperidone is a treatment with good supporting evidence for short-term safety and efficacy derived from at least 2 randomised placebo controlled trials (RCT&#8217;s) with positive results. Other atypical neuroleptics which have been studied include; olanzapine, sulpiride. tiapride and quetiapine, but the evidence for their efficacy and safety is less well established comprising only one positive RCT; open label studies; or accumulated clinical experience. Available trials indicate that risperidone can improve tics for between 30% and 62% of patients with GTS (<LINK REF="REF-Bruggeman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruggeman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dion--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dion 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaffney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaffney 2002</LINK>). IIn an international, multicentre study of more than 3000 patients it was found that clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is the most frequently prescribed medication. The evidence for its efficacy is, however, inconsistent with other studies on clonidine which found no improvement in tics or behaviour when using objective measures (<LINK REF="REF-Gancher-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gancher 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goetz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetz 1987</LINK>). The treatment of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually the stimulant medication methylphenidate. It was believed that such medication would exacerbate tics. However, a recent study by the Tourette's Syndrome Study Group (<LINK REF="REF-TSSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSSG 2002</LINK>) demonstrated that methylphenidate plus clonidine was effective in reducing ADHD in patients with comorbid tic disorders, without incurring tic exacerbation. ADHD is thought to occur in between 21 and 90per cent of patients with GTS. Obsessive compulsive behaviour is also common in GTS. For patiedemonstrated that methylphenidate plus clonidine was effective in reducing ADHD in patients with comorbid tic disorders, without incurring tic exacerbation. ADHD is thought to occur in between 21% and 90% of patients with GTS. Obsessive compulsive behaviour (OCB) is also common in GTS. For patients with OCB and comorbid tics, therapy using both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a neuroleptic may be required for effective symptom reduction (<LINK REF="REF-McDougle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDougle 1994</LINK>). Drugs currently used in the treatment of GTS either lack efficacy or are associated with intolerable side effects. Conventional antipsychotic medication such as haloperidol can result in sedation, cognitive slowing, body weight gain, low mood and extrapyramidal symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptoms include: dystonia, which can take the form of fatigue, muscle rigidity, posturing and tongue protrusion; parkinsonian symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, lack of facial expression, drooling and difficulty in movement; akathisia; which is motor restlessness; or dyskinesia, which can take the form of torsion spasm, oculogyric crisis, a condition where the eyeballs rotate upwards and become fixed in that position, head dropping and stiff neck. The newer atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, cause drowsiness, dizziness, weight gain, anxiety, impaired glucose tolerance, headaches and the possibility of extrapyramidal symptoms. Clonidine, which can take up to six weeks to have an effect, causes sedation, dry mouth, itchy eyes, dizziness, headache and postural hypotension (a large decrease in blood pressure on standing, which may result in fainting). Methylphenidate, used to treat ADHD occurring comorbidly with GTS, can cause irritability, nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, abdominal pain and headaches. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can cause nausea, vomiting, anorexia and insomnia. No drug has a beneficial effect on the full range of symptoms found in GTS.<BR/>
<BR/>The cannabis plant contains many compounds. The most abundant and most psychoactive of the cannabinoids is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC). Cannabis contains over 60 cannabinoid compounds and some, such as cannabidiol, may modulate the response to THC. Two separate cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, were identified and cloned in 1990 and 1993, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuda-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuda 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsuda-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuda 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 1993</LINK>). The CB1 cannabinoid receptor subtype is found predominantly on neurones in the central nervous system. They are found throughout the brain but are most densely concentrated in the basal ganglia, hippocampus and cerebellum (<LINK REF="REF-Romero-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 2002</LINK>). The endocannabinoid system regulates synaptic neurotransmission. There is experimental evidence that cannabinoids have an effect on the activity of most neurotransmitters <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>. The endocannabinoid system regulates synaptic neurotransmission. There is experimental evidence that cannabinoids have an effect on the activity of most neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>). Many neurological diseases occur because of disordered neurotransmission leading to excess excitation or a lack of inhibition. Smoking has been the route of administration for many cannabis users. This is not a viable option when using cannabis therapeutically, owing to the potential for long-term adverse effects from smoke inhalation. Oral preparations such as nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, and dronabinol have been used. However, oral administration is also problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations.<BR/>There are a variety of potential adverse effects associated with the therapeutic use of cannabinoids. Cannabis and &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC produce dose-related impairments in short-term memory, attention, hand-eye co-ordination, vigilance and the perception of time and distance. This profile of impairments may contribute to motor vehicle and other accidents. Cannabis can induce a schizophreniform psychosis in normal individuals, precipitate schizophrenia in predisposed individuals and exacerbate positive symptoms in schizophrenics (<LINK REF="REF-Johns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 2001</LINK>). Tolerance can develop to the recreationally desired high; this could encourage dose escalation or an increase in the frequency of use. There is evidence that some people have difficulty in stopping cannabis use. Withdrawal symptoms can include restlessness, irritability, anxiety, aggression, dysphoria (an emotional state characterized by anxiety, depression, or unease), tremor and insomnia. Neurocognitive deficits induced by cannabis are dose-related and may persist for some time after cessation. <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1996</LINK> found that acute anxiety and panic attacks after cannabis use caused problems for 22% of a sample of 1000 cannabis users.<BR/>
<BR/>There is some anecdotal and experimental evidence that Cannabis sativa and &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC may be effective in treating tics and compulsive behaviour in patients with GTS. In 1988, Sandyk and Awerbuch (<LINK REF="REF-Sandyk-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandyk 1988</LINK>) reported three patients with GTS who experienced 'a significant amelioration of symptoms' when smoking marijuana. There is also a detailed single case report where marijuana was reported to provide effective treatment for the symptoms of GTS (<LINK REF="REF-Hemming-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemming 1993</LINK>). Sixty-four patients with GTS were interviewed about their use of cannabis and, of the 17 who reported cannabis use, 14 experienced a reduction or remission of tics and also some beneficial effect on premonitory urges and obsessive compulsive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Muller_x002d_Vahl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller-Vahl 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>There are currently no systematic Cochrane reviews of treatments used in GTS. Two other Cochrane reviews are presently being undertaken on the use of fluoxetine and pimozide for tics in GTS.</P>

All participants had a diagnosis of GTS according to DSM-III R. Eight participants took part in both studies. In the single dose study, seven of the 12 patients were unmedicated prior to the study. Five were taking additional medication for symptomatic treatment, two patients were medicated with pimozide, one with tiapride, one with diazepam and one with pimozide, clonazepam and fluoxetine. In the six week study, 15 of the 24 patients were unmedicated for at least six months prior to taking part in the study. Nine patients were taking medication for symptomatic relief, four were taking neuroleptics, two were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and three were taking a combination of SSRIs and neuroleptics.</P>
<P>Interventions<BR/>The study medication was &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC administered in gelatin capsules of either 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg. The placebo capsules were identical in appearance and in taste. The dose of oral Interventions<BR/>The study medication was &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC administered in gelatin capsules of either 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg. The placebo capsules were identical in appearance and in taste. The dose of oral &#916;9THC varied in the two studies. In the single dose study <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2002</LINK>, patients received different doses based on weight, gender, age and prior cannabis use. Females with age &gt; 50 years, weight &lt; 60 kg and no prior cannabis use were allocated 5 mg; all other female patients were allocated 7.5 mg. Males with age &gt; 60 years, weight &lt; 70 kg and no prior cannabis use were allocated 5 mg; males with age &lt; 50 years, weight &gt; 70 kg and prior cannabis use received 10 mg; all other males were given 7.5 mg. All patients were hospitalised for one night on the treatment day.<BR/>In the six-week study <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2003_x002f_1" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2003/1</LINK> , patients were assigned randomly to &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC in gelatin capsules of 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg or to placebo. Patients assigned to the placebo group were given placebo throughout the study. The dose was titrated to a target dose of 10.0 mg. Starting at 2.5 mg/day the dose was increased by 2.5 mg every four days. The same dosing schedule was used to reduce the medication at the end of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate the maximum dose, the medication was reduced by up to 5.0 mg until a tolerated dose was achieved.<BR/>
<BR/>Outcome measures<BR/>In the single dose trial <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2002</LINK> tic severity was rated by patients before and three to four hours after treatment using the Tourette's Syndrome Symptom List (TSSL). Tic severity was also assessed before and after treatment using different examiner ratings: Shapiro Tourette's Syndrome Severity Scale (STSS), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Tourette Syndrome Global Scale (TSGS). Patients were also asked to rate: severity of impulse control, obsessive compulsive behaviours (OCB), anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and premonitory experiences prior to tics, before and after the treatment. These were rated using: 0 = none; 1 = very mild; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe; 5 = very severe. OCB was subdivided into obsessions and compulsions such as: checking, ordering, doing things right, counting, rituals, washing and doing things an exact number of times. Patients were also asked at the end of each treatment day to rate the global change (0, ± 10%, ± 20%, and so on up to ± 100%) and to document adverse reactions. At the end of the second treatment day they were also asked which day they assessed as more positive overall, taking into account global change and adverse effects; 10%, 20%, 30% etc.<BR/>In the six week study (<LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2003_x002f_1" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2003/1</LINK>), tic severity was rated using several different examiner rating scales: the Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impressions Scale (TS-CGI); STSS; YGTSS; plus a video-based rating scale. Patients rated tics using TSSL and they also rated severity of premonitory urges.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Validity and reliability of outcome measures<BR/>The STSS and the YGTSS are valid and highly reliable outcome measures <LINK REF="REF-Advances-in-Neurology-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Advances in Neurology 2001</LINK>. The TSGS is less reliable. The way the score is derived may exaggerate small differences in tic severity. This scale also combines information from different domains in a way that is not justified <LINK REF="REF-Advances-in-Neurology-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Advances in Neurology 2001</LINK>. The TSSL is a self and parent report instrument. Self reports are easy to administer but the reviewer found no evidence that the TSSL had undergone rigorous psychometric validation. Goetz devised a video rating protocol which is reliable and valid. The Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impressions Scale (TS-CGI) has established validity and reliability <LINK REF="REF-Walkup-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walkup 1992</LINK>.<BR/>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 16:36:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomisation method and concealment of allocation<BR/>It was stated for both trials that randomisation was done by a psychiatrist not involved in the study and the codes were kept by him until the study was complete. There was no clear description of exactly how the patients were selected for randomisation and selection bias is possible. No investigators or patients had access to the randomisation codes during the study.<BR/>
<BR/>Eligibility criteria<BR/>Both studies accepted patients with a clinical diagnosis of GTS using DSM III-R.<BR/>
<BR/>Patient numbers and baseline characteristics.<BR/>A total number of 28 different patients were studied. There were 12 patients in the single dose study <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2002</LINK>, eight of which also took part in the six week study <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2003_x002f_1" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2003/1</LINK>. The second study began with 24 patients comprising eight from the first study, plus 16 new participants. The small numbers of participants included in these two trials means that the results may not be applicable to all patients with Tourette's syndrome.<BR/>
<BR/>Drop outs<BR/>Seven patients dropped out of the six week study or had to be excluded. From the published data it appears that there were five drop outs/exclusions from the treatment group and two drop outs/exclusions from the placebo group. The difference in drop out between the two groups could cause attrition bias. It may be argued that those patients deriving least benefit from the treatment are the most likely to withdraw, leaving the better responders and thus producing an artificially inflated effect size. One patient withdrew because of adverse effects.<BR/>
<BR/>Blinding of patients and assessors<BR/>Both trials were conducted as double-blind trials. Due to the psychoactive nature of &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC, it might have been possible for participants and examiners to form an opinion about which treatment was being given. The participants may have been aware of physiological changes such as dizziness and the examiners may have noticed red eyes and behavioural indications typical of cannabinoid medication. This could have led to a Hawthorne effect in the patients and to possible ascertainment bias in the investigators.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Data analysis<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2002</LINK> using the examiner ratings STSS, TSGS and YGTSS, global tic severity scores were lower after treatment with &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC than after treatment with placebo. However, the difference did not achieve statistical significance. No correction was made for analysing multiple tests although the chance of achieving a false significant result increases greatly as multiple analyses are carried out. When the subscores were analysed some improvements did achieve significance. Using the TSGS, complex motor tics (CMT) were found to be significantly reduced without using a correction for multiple testing. Some trends were reported in favour of &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC but trends are not statistically significant. Using the TSSL, the improvement in OCB was significant (although again not corrected for multiple testing). As all the scales ostensibly measure the same symptoms, if the results were large and truly significant then the difference between treatment and placebo groups should have been found using all measures rather than just in a few subscales of two of the measures.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2003_x002f_1" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2003/1</LINK> analyses were only carried out on patients who completed the treatment. Intention to treat analysis would have been preferable as the drop outs were likely to be patients who derived less benefit and excluding them from analysis could have given a false positive result.</P>

<P>We found only two studies which compared a cannabinoid therapy with placebo to treat the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome.<BR/>A number of outcome measures were used: the Tourette Syndrome Global Scale (TSGS); the Shapiro Tourette Syndrome Severity Scale (STSSS); the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS); the Tourette's Syndrome Symptom List (TSSL). A video rating protocol and the Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impressions scale (TS-CGI) were used in the six week study but not in the single dose study. Many of the measures were designed to assess the same outcome: tic reduction.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Vahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Vahl 2002</LINK>
<BR/>In this single dose crossover study, using the examiner ratings TSGS, STSSS and YGTSS, the following findings were reported:<BR/>
<BR/>TSGS<BR/>Tic severity scores demonstrated a greater reduction after &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC than after placebo but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.132). Further analysis of subscores found a significant improvement in scores for complex motor tics (CMT) (p = 0.015).<BR/>
<BR/>STSS<BR/>No significant difference was found between placebo and &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC.<BR/>
<BR/>YGTSS<BR/>No significant difference was found between placebo and &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC.<BR/>
<BR/>Using the patient rated scale TSSL, the following findings were reported:<BR/>
<BR/>TSSL<BR/>The authors reported a significant reduction in tics after treatment with &#916;<SUP>9</SUP> THC compared with placebo (p = 0.015).<BR/>The authors added some additional ratings to the TSSL and using these non-validated additional ratings they reported a significant difference in OCB (p = 0.041).<BR/>
<BR/>Adverse events<BR/>No serious adverse effects were reported although one patient in the &#916;<SUP>9</SUP> THC group stopped medication at day four due to anxiety and restlessness. Five patients out of 12 reported mild transient adverse reactions lasting between one and six hours.<BR/>

<BR/>In this six-week parallel group study, using the following examiner ratings: TS-CGI, STSS, YGTSS and the video rating scale, the following results were reported:<BR/>
<BR/>TS-CGI<BR/>The authors reported significant differences between the &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC and placebo groups on the two visits when the patients were taking the maximum dose (p = 0.05 and p = 0.008, respectively). There was no overall significant difference using ANOVA. Authors reported a trend (p = 0.079).<BR/>
<BR/>STSS<BR/>The authors reported a significant difference on the visit when the patients were taking the maximum dose (p = 0.033). There was no overall significant difference using ANOVA.<BR/>
<BR/>YGTSS<BR/>No significant difference was found but a trend in favour of was reported (p = 0.06). Analysis of a subscore "motor global scale" found a significant difference at maximum &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC dose (p = 0.04). There was no overall significant difference using ANOVA. Authors reported a trend (p = 0.077).<BR/>
<BR/>Video rating<BR/>A significant difference was found between the scores for the treatment group and the placebo group on the visit when the patients were taking the maximum dose (p = 0.030).<BR/>There was no overall significant difference using ANOVA.<BR/>
<BR/>Using the patient rated scale TSSL, the authors reported as follows:<BR/>
<BR/>TSSL<BR/>On 10 different treatment days a significant difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups (p &lt;0.05). Using ANOVA there was an overall significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037).<BR/>
<BR/>Using the Bonferroni adjustment, the authors reported one significant group difference using the TS-CGI on the visit when the patients were taking maximum dose (p = 0.008).<BR/>
<BR/>Adverse events<BR/>No serious adverse events were reported. Five patients from the &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC group reported mild adverse effects such as tiredness, dry mouth, dizziness and muzziness. These adverse events did not cause anyone to reduce the study medication.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-31 16:42:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the background section of this review we set out the reasons why cannabinoid medication might be useful in the symptomatic treatment of Tourette's syndrome. At the present time only two studies have been conducted. Both studies used tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC).<BR/>
<BR/>The positive finding was that in both studies &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THC was associated with tic reduction. The major limitations of the two studies are the relatively small sample size and the large number of multiple comparisons made. There were only 28 different participants in total, since eight participants took part in both studies. Possibly the patients who derived the greatest benefit and experienced the least adverse effects would be the most inclined to participate in further studies, which could act as a form of selection bias. There were a high number of drop outs/exclusions in the six week study and the results from this study were not analysed using intention to treat analysis (ITT). The results that are reported are analyses done on the patients who remained in the study on the study medication at the correct dose. In reality, patients do opt not to continue treatment if there is limited efficacy or unpalatable side effects. This introduces attrition bias. Whilst there were some significant results, the authors themselves accept that very few of these results are significant if a Bonferroni correction is performed. It is possible that cannabinoid medication has a beneficial effect which is too weak to be detected using ITT and such a small sample size. There is some weak evidence that cannabinoid medication may have an effect on obsessive compulsive behaviour but the measure used was an addition to the TSSL which has not been validated.<BR/>
<BR/>There were no data on the effect of &#916;<SUP>9</SUP>THCon quality of life.<BR/>
