<TITLE>Horse chestnut seed extract for long-term or chronic venous insufficiency</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-20 11:24:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Poor blood flow in the veins of the legs, known as chronic venous insufficiency, is a common health problem, particularly with ageing. It can cause leg pain, swelling (oedema), itchiness (pruritus) and tenseness as well as hardening of the skin (dermatosclerosis) and fatigue. Wearing compression stockings or socks helps but people may find them uncomfortable and do not always wear them. A seed extract of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) is a herbal remedy used for venous insufficiency. Seventeen randomised controlled trials were included in the review. In all trials the extract was standardised to escin, which is the main active constituent of horse chestnut seed extract.</P>
<P>Overall, the trials suggested an improvement in the symptoms of leg pain, oedema and pruritus with horse chestnut seed extract when taken as capsules over two to 16 weeks. Six placebo-controlled studies (543 participants) reported a clear reduction of leg pain when the herbal extract was compared with placebo. Similar results were reported for oedema, leg volume, leg circumference and pruritis. The other studies which compared the extract with rutosides (four trials), pycnogenol (one trial) or compression stockings (two trials) reported no significant differences between the therapies for leg pain or a symptom score that included leg pain. The herbal extract was equivalent to rutosides, pycnogenol and compression on the other symptoms with the exception that it was inferior to pycnogenol on oedema.</P>
<P>The adverse events reported (14 trials) were mild and infrequent. They included gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, nausea, headache and pruritus, from six studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-03 12:28:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance. Therefore, oral drug treatment is an attractive option. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and updated in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or reference therapy, for the treatment of CVI.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-19 13:13:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched June 2012) and CENTRAL (Issue 5, 2012). For the previous versions of the review the authors searched AMED (inception to July 2005) and Phytobase (inception to January 2001) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for CVI. Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted for published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:49:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs comparing oral HCSE mono-preparations with placebo, or reference therapy, in people with CVI. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation, or as a part of a combination treatment, were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both authors independently selected the studies and, using a standard scoring system, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, there appeared to be an improvement in CVI related signs and symptoms with HCSE compared with placebo. Leg pain was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Six reported a significant reduction of leg pain in the HCSE groups compared with the placebo groups, while another reported a statistically significant improvement compared with baseline. One trial suggested a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 42.4 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9 to 49.9) measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Leg volume was assessed in seven placebo-controlled trials. Six trials (n = 502) suggested a WMD of 32.1ml (95% CI 13.49 to 50.72) in favour of HCSE compared with placebo. One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as treatment with compression stockings. Adverse events were usually mild and infrequent.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-23 09:40:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence presented suggests that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However, several caveats exist and larger, definitive RCTs are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment option.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-29 13:46:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is one of the commonest conditions afflicting humans. About 10-15% of men and 20-25% of women present signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of CVI, indicating that being female is an important risk factor, as well as age, geographical location and race (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1994</LINK>). This condition is characterised by chronic inadequate drainage of venous blood and venous hypertension, which results in leg oedema (swelling), dermatosclerosis (hardening of the skin) and feelings of pain, fatigue and tenseness in the lower extremities (<LINK REF="REF-Spraycar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spraycar 1995</LINK>). Patients often require hospitalisation and surgery, for instance, for symptomatic varicose veins (<LINK REF="REF-London-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">London 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 17:28:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mechanical compression is the treatment of choice for this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1991</LINK>). However, compression therapy, for example, using compression stockings often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance. Oral drug treatment is therefore an attractive option.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:56:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Horse chestnut (<I>Aesculus hippocastanum L</I>.) has traditionally been used as a herbal remedy for treating CVI (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardelli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardelli 1996</LINK>). The seed extract of <I>Aesculus</I> <I>hippocastanum</I> <I>L</I>. (HCSE) contains escin, a triterpenic saponin, as its active component (<LINK REF="REF-Guillaume-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillaume 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schrader-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrader 1995</LINK>). Escin has been shown to inhibit the activity of hyaluronidase, an enzyme involved in proteoglycan degradation (<LINK REF="REF-Facino-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facino 1995</LINK>). The accumulation of leucocytes (white blood cells) in CVI-affected limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Moyses-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyses 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1988</LINK>) and subsequent activation and release of such enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1993</LINK>) is considered to be an important pathophysiological mechanism of CVI.</P>

<P>There were no special issues such as carry-over effects or period effects with the analysis of the three cross over trials included in this review. </P>
<P>Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan Analyses 1.0.4. It uses the inverse of the variance to assign a weight to the mean of the within-study treatment effect. For most studies, however, the information was insufficient. The Cochrane Collaboration suggests imputing the variance of the change by assuming a correlation factor between pre-intervention and post-intervention values. The variance of the change was imputed using a correlation factor of 0.4, which was then used to assign a weight to the mean of the within-study treatment effect.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-23 12:52:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of our systematic review suggest, overall, that compared with placebo and reference treatment, HCSE is an effective treatment option for CVI. The adverse events reported in the reviewed trials were mild and infrequent. Thus, according to the available data the risk/benefit ratio of HCSE for the short term treatment of CVI is positive.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-01 16:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In an attempt to locate all randomised trials of oral preparations containing HCSE, 29 trials were identified of which 17 could be included. It is noteworthy that one unpublished trial was supplied by a manufacturer of HCSE-containing preparations, while a second unpublished trial was identified in a report by another author (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2000</LINK>). The search strategy for this review involved several databases including those with a focus on the European and American literature, as well as manual searching and contact with experts and manufacturers. Moreover, searching was not restricted in terms of publication language.</P>
<P>The conservative treatment of CVI comprises a number of other therapeutic modalities. Compression therapy improves venous return and is widely accepted as the treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Tooke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tooke 1996</LINK>). In combination with heparin, it prevents venous stasis and reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis. O-ß-hydroxyethyl rutosides are reported to have beneficial short-term effects by reducing oedema and relieving symptoms of CVI. However, their efficacy during long-term use has yet to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Wadworth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadworth 1992</LINK>). Ruscus extract decreases capillary filtration rate in healthy volunteers and people with CVI (<LINK REF="REF-Rudofsky-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudofsky 1991</LINK>). A review has concluded that combined treatment using oedema protective agents and compression therapy improves CVI to a greater extend than either treatment alone (<LINK REF="REF-Diehm-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 1996b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of action involved in the observed effects when HCSE is administered may be of interest. The active component of HCSE is the saponin escin (<LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1960</LINK>). This has been shown to inhibit the activity of elastase and hyaluronidase <I>in</I> <I>vitro</I>. Both these enzymes are involved in proteoglycan degradation (proteoglycan constitutes part of the capillary endothelium and is the main component of the extravascular matrix) (<LINK REF="REF-Facino-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facino 1995</LINK>). The accumulation of leucocytes (white blood cells) in CVI-affected limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Moyses-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyses 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1988</LINK>), and subsequent activation and release of such enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1993</LINK>), is considered to be an important pathophysiological mechanism of CVI. An earlier study found increased serum activity of proteoglycan hydrolases in patients with CVI that were reduced with HCSE (<LINK REF="REF-Kreysel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreysel 1983</LINK>). HCSE treatment may shift the equilibrium between degradation and synthesis of proteoglycans towards a net synthesis, thus preventing vascular leakage. This hypothesis has been supported by animal experiments (<LINK REF="REF-Enghofer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enghofer 1984</LINK>). Using electron microscopy, the author demonstrated a marked reduction in vascular leakage after treatment with HCSE. Uncertainty exists regarding the effects of HCSE on venous tone. <I>In</I> <I>vitro</I>, HCSE increases venous pressure of normal and pathologically altered veins. This is corroborated by studies in laboratory animals, which demonstrate an increase in venous pressure and venous flow after HCSE administration (<LINK REF="REF-Guillaume-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillaume 1994</LINK>). However, studies on humans have failed to replicate effects on venous capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Bisler-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bisler 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudofsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rudofsky 1986</LINK>).</P>

<P>Despite systematic efforts to find all studies on the subject, it is conceivable that some were not uncovered.

There is also evidence that positive findings may be over-represented in complementary medicine journals (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>) and that these journals favour positive conclusions at the expense of methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2000</LINK>). Therefore, there is a possibility that treatment effects are exaggerated. Overall, we are confident that the search strategy that we used and the therefore the completeness of the evidence minimised bias. However, more trials assessing the efficacy of HCSE in larger patient samples using adequate outcome measures and systematic investigations of its safety are still required (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2001</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-06-01 16:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These findings update and extend the findings of previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Pittler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebert 2002</LINK>). In the reviewed trials adverse events were mild and infrequent, which supports the findings of post-marketing surveillance studies (<LINK REF="REF-Greeske-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greeske 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leskow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leskow 1996</LINK>) reporting pruritus, nausea, gastrointestinal complaints, headache and dizziness in 43 of 6183 patients (0.7%) treated with HCSE.</P>

<P>The evidence presented suggests that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However, caveats exist and more rigorous, large RCTs are required to assess the efficacy of this treatment option.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future studies should be rigorously executed and reported in a uniform manner following the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Detailed description of randomisation and double-blinding procedures should be included in the report. More controlled clinical trials are needed, which should include larger numbers of participants and assess HCSE particularly for long-term use and as an adjunct to compression treatment.</P>
