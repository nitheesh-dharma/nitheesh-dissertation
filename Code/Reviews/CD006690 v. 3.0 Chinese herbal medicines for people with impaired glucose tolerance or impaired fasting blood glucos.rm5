<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:44:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Around 308 million people worldwide are reported to have 'impaired glucose tolerance'. These individuals show higher than normal blood sugar (glucose) levels, but do not meet diagnostic criteria for having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This may provide a window in which to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and its complications like cardiovascular disease. Within a decade of the initial diagnosis 'impared glucose tolerance' 25% to 75% are estimated to progress to diabetes.</P>
<P>This review examined 16 randomised controlled trials of 15 different Chinese herbal medicines. The trials lasted from four weeks to two years (average nine months) and involved altogether 1391 participants. Death from any cause, diabetic complications and economic outcomes were not investigated. No serious adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>The available evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicines are able to lower and normalise high blood glucose. Due to considerable distortions (bias) in the trials, further high-quality and rigorously evaluated studies are required before any conclusions can confidently be reached about the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and the delay of diabetes onset.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:44:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>This review examined 16 trials lasting four weeks to two years involving 1391 participants receiving 15 different Chinese herbal medicines in eight different comparisons. No trial reported on mortality, morbidity or costs. No serious adverse events like severe hypoglycaemia were observed. Meta-analysis of eight trials showed that those receiving Chinese herbal medicines combined with lifestyle modification were more than twice as likely to have their fasting plasma glucose levels return to normal levels (i.e. fasting plasma glucose &lt;7.8 mmol/L and 2hr blood glucose &lt;11.1 mmol/L) compared to lifestyle modification alone (RR 2.07; 95% confidence intervall (CI) 1.52 to 2.82). Those receiving Chinese herbs were less likely to progress to diabetes over the duration of the trial (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.58). However, all trials had a considerable risk of bias and none of the specific herbal medicines comparison data was available from more than one study. Moreover, results could have been confounded by rates of natural reversion to normal glucose levels.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:34:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The positive evidence in favour of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of IGT or IFG is constrained by the following factors: lack of trials that tested the same herbal medicine, lack of details on co-interventions, unclear methods of randomisation, poor reporting and other risks of bias.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:56:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:54:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>In 2007, an estimated 308 million had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or about 7.5% of the age group 20 to 79 years. More than 80% live in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-IDF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF 2008</LINK>). This is projected to rise to 418 million, or 8.1% by 2025. Around 10% of people with combined impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and IGT will progress to diabetes per year. The progression rate from isolated IGT to diabetes is estimated at 3.7% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Engberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engberg 2009</LINK>). The predicted cumulative 5 to 6 year incidence of development of type 2 diabetes for people with either IGT or IFG is 20% to 34%, those with both IGT and IFG have a progression rate of 38% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>IGT and IFG are frequently present for many years until health checks reveal raised plasma glucose levels, or diabetic symptoms develop. By the time a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made around half of all people have diabetes related tissue damage. Even after diagnosis, management of type 2 diabetes is not easy. Achieving and maintaining normal glucose levels is difficult, leading to long-term complications. Coronary heart disease has been shown to be more prevalent in people with impaired glucose tolerance compared to those with normal glucose tolerance and is likely to develop before the onset of diabetes or symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Haller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haller 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The concept of IGT was first introduced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1979. Criteria for diagnosing IGT and IFG were revised by the WHO in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Unwin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unwin 2002</LINK>). People with IGTshow abnormal fasting plasma glucose and abnormal two-hour post-load plasma glucose values. People with IFG only however, demonstrate an abnormal fasting plasma glucose. Currently, the criteria for IGT and IFG are as follows (plasma venous glucose concentrations):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>IGT - fasting blood glucose less than 7.0 mmol/L and two-hour post-load blood glucose 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>IFG - fasting blood glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (two-hour post-load blood glucose less than 7.8 mmol/L, if measured) (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). In 2003, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended to change these criteria to 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The pathophysiology of the progression to type 2 diabetes is complex and still not fully understood. The progression seems to be governed by two processes: 1) a decline in sensitivity to the action of insulin, and 2) dysfunction and eventual exhaustion of beta-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Polonsky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polonsky 1996</LINK>). Beta-cell dysfunction starts some 10 to 12 years prior to the presentation of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). This provides a window of opportunity to prevent or delay development of type 2 diabetes, and potentially diminish the risk of cardiovascular and other complications.</P>
<P>'Lifestyle' modification is the ideal method of delaying or preventing diabetes as it also reduces cardiovascular risk profile (<LINK REF="REF-DPP-Research-GP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP Research GP 2002</LINK>). A systematic review concluded that lifestyle education was clearly effective for reducing two-hour plasma glucose and the incidence of type 2 diabetes over one year (<LINK REF="REF-Yamaoka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamaoka 2005</LINK>). Not all individuals however, will be able to undertake the intensive lifestyle interventions prescribed in these trials. Long-term adherence to the interventions described is a potentially limiting factor (<LINK REF="REF-Padwal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padwal 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Pharmacological interventions have been employed to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. Several studies have measured the effects of various interventions in people with IGT on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therapy with metformin (a biguanide), troglitazone (a thiazolidinedione, see below), or acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) have reduced the progression of IGT to diabetes mellitus by 31%, 49% and 25%, respectively. Metformin is probably the most extensively used pharmacological treatment for people with prediabetes to date. It improves peripheral and liver sensitivity to insulin, reduces basal liver glucose production and increases insulin-stimulated uptake and utilisation of glucose by peripheral tissues (<LINK REF="REF-AHFS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHFS 1999</LINK>). The 'Diabetes Prevention Program' found that while metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes by 31% compared to placebo, the efficacy of metformin was variable among subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-DPP-Research-GP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP Research GP 2002</LINK>). Metformin is less effective in those over 60 years of age, those with a body mass index (BMI) less than 35 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and those with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) below 6.1 mmol/L. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea, flatulence, nausea and vomiting occurred in 77 of every 100 persons on metformin in the study.</P>
<P>Troglitazone, which was withdrawn from the market due to an increased incidence of drug-induced hepatic damage, markedly reduced the incidence of diabetes during its limited period of use, but this action did not persist (<LINK REF="REF-Knowler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowler 2005</LINK>). Whether other thiazolidinedione drugs used for longer periods can safely prevent or delay diabetes remains to be determined.</P>
<P>The class of drugs called alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are also sometimes used where blood sugar levels are not being stabilized through diet and exercise, or where metformin is not suitable or tolerated. The main alpha-glucosidase inhibitor currently used is acarbose. Acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, the carbohydrates will remain in the intestine. In the colon, bacteria will digest the complex carbohydrates, thereby causing gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence (78% of people) and diarrhoea (14% of people). A systematic review of acarbose in people with IGT found that the use of acarbose reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes, but the effects on glycaemic control are limited (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:52:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Chinese herbal medicines include the use of plant, animal and mineral substances in preparations administered as pills, teas and powders. Chinese herbal medicines have long been used for the treatment of IGT and IFG and diabetes in China, Korea and Japan, with strong supportive anecdotal evidence for their efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>) and may offer a safe and effective alternative. These herbal medicines tend to be complex formulas combining two or more herbs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:56:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Pharmacological studies of the Chinese herbal formulas for the treatment of diabetes indicate that the mechanisms of action of these interventions might be multifactorial. It has been suggested that herbs containing polysaccharides restore the function of the pancreatic tissues causing increased insulin output by the beta-cells. Other herbs have been thought to enhance the microcirculation, increase the availability of insulin and facilitate the metabolism in insulin dependent processes (<LINK REF="REF-Jia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2006</LINK>). Herbal formulas that exert such a combined effect on insulin and blood glucose control in people with diabetes have relevance to IGT and IFG.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The chronic nature of prediabetes and diabetes means that people are potentially on treatments for a long period of time which increases the likelihood of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>). Chinese herbal medicines have a long history of being used to treat diabetes and prediabetes in broad and varied population groups. As a consequence there is an accumulated knowledge of the safety in the use for many of the herbal substances. However, all medicinal agents have potentially unexpected effects including toxicity, and herbals are no different. Adverse effects of herbal medications may be intrinsic such as predictable toxicity, overdosage, interaction with other pharmaceutical or idiopathic (allergy, anaphylaxis etc). They may also be extrinsic, relating to misidentification, contamination, lack of standardisation and so on (<LINK REF="REF-Bensoussan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensoussan 1996</LINK>).<B>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-07-19 03:39:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane review of herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes reviewed 66 randomised controlled trials and demonstrated that some herbal medicines with hypoglycaemic effects may be beneficial in type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>). However, no systematic review on the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines in people with IGT or IFG has been undertaken. In view of the high proportion of people with IGT that go on to develop overt diabetes, and potentially cardiovascular disease, there is considerable interest in exploring therapeutic approaches that will reduce the risk of diabetes in individuals with IGT with minimal or no adverse effects where lifestyle modifications have failed and pharmacological treatment is inappropriate.</P>

<P>The authors of significant publications or experts in the relevant field were contacted for potential studies. We telephoned authors who had published two or more papers on clinical trials of prediabetes (three authors). When we contacted authors to collect details on included and excluded studies they were asked if they had participated in any other clinical trials of Chinese herbal medicines and IGT. Details of contact are provided in the tables of included and excluded studies. Relevant pharmaceutical companies which produced relevant products, were to be checked and contacted. However none were contacted, the products on the market are aimed at type 2 diabetes not prediabetes.</P>

<P>There were 16 randomised clinical trials included in this review. They reported random allocations of participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to Chinese herbal medicines versus controls. Nine studies randomised participants to receive Chinese herbal medicines with a co-intervention of lifestyle modification versus a control of lifestyle modification alone (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-GJ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fan GJ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hao-AZ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hao AZ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-CP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li CP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-QZ-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tang QZ 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang B 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-Z-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yao Z 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-AS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wei AS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-YH-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng YH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>).

The details of the trials are listed under '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>The duration of the trials ranged from four weeks to two years (mean 9.3 months). Of the 16 included trials, eight trials ran for over 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-GJ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fan GJ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-CP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li CP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-QZ-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tang QZ 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-YX-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang YX 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-AS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wei AS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-YH-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng YH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>).

<P>The trials were all conducted from 2001 onwards. One study is still awaiting classification.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The sixteen trials included 1391 participants. The average number of participants in the trials was 87, ranging from 42 to 168.</P>
<P>Mean age of the participants was 52, ranging from 44 to 66 years (missing data from <LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>). This is consistent with population prevalence which shows that the 40 to 59 years age group currently has the greatest number of persons with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-IDF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were 719 males and 659 females (no gender data available on 13 withdrawals). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>) chose to enrol female participants only (n = 81). The aim of this study was primarily to assess insulin resistance and visceral adiposity. One other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hao-AZ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hao AZ 2004</LINK>) had an over-representation of males to females (121 : 47). The overall ratio of the trials is not consistent with the population prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes which shows a female predominance with females ranging 10% higher than males for diabetes, and females ranging 20% higher than males for impaired glucose tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-IDF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials enrolled obese or overweight participants only (<LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-J-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shi J 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The diagnostic criteria used in the trials were mainly based on the WHO criteria. Eight trials used WHO 1999 and three trials used WHO 1985 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-Z-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yao Z 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-YH-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng YH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>) . Four trials used the American Diabetes Association (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>) criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lu X 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qu-LX-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qu LX 2002</LINK>; ; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang B 2004</LINK>). One trial used a combination of the WHO 1999 and the ADA 1997 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-YX-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang YX 2005</LINK>). The ADA criteria rely on a fasting plasma glucose level equal or greater than 6.1 mmol/L and less than 7.0 mmol/L. This differs from the WHO 1999 criteria which uses both a fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/L AND a 2hr blood glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) equal or greater than 7.8 and less than 11.0. The WHO 1985 criteria had a slightly higher range for including people as IGT - fasting plasma glucose less than 7.8 mmol/L. The different diagnostic criteria were subjected to a sensitivity analysis but no significant differences were detected (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen Chinese herbal medicine interventions were examined in the 16 randomised trials (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Chinese herbal medicine <I>Jinqi jiangtang </I>was tested in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-YX-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang YX 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>). The trials all tested compounds of complex herbal formulas (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> 'Preparation and compositions of the Chinese herbal medicines'). Preparations of herbs were as decoctions, pills, capsules or granules.</P>
<P>The herbal composition of the interventions varied. However, some individual herbs were prevalent in the different formulas. <I>Astragalus membranecus </I>was present in 10 of the 15 interventions for which the ingredients were known. Where<I> Astragalus membranecus </I>was a major part of the formula (either in amounts equal or greater than 20 g or only one of six herbs) it was analysed in a separate analysis.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes reported were mainly metabolic parameters including fasting blood glucose (reported in all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Qu-LX-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qu LX 2002</LINK>), 2hr fasting glucose (reported in all studies) and 'normalisation of fasting blood glucose' (reported in 10 studies). Normalisation was defined as fasting blood glucose &lt;7.0 mmol/L and 2hr oGTT &#8804;7.8 mmol/L according to WHO 1999 criteria for all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Yao-Z-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yao Z 2001</LINK>, which used the ADA 1997 criteria for normal glucose tolerance of fasting blood glucose less than 6.1 mmol/L. Outcomes on normalisation of blood glucose were recorded as dichotomous data.</P>
<P>Ten studies measured the incidence of diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-GJ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fan GJ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hao-AZ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hao AZ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-CP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li CP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-QZ-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tang QZ 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-YX-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang YX 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-AS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wei AS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-Z-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yao Z 2001</LINK>). Incidence of diabetes refers to the number of participants that have converted to diabetes by the completion of the trial. Eight of the ten trials reporting on this outcome used WHO 1999 criteria to define diabetes (FPG &gt;7.0 mmol/L and 2hr oGTT &gt;11.0 mmol/L).</P>

<P>Normalisation of fasting blood glucose refers to the number of participants who returned to normal blood glucose range at the end of the trial.</P>
<P>Eight trials involving 625 participants reported on the normalisation of fasting blood glucose levels following the intervention.</P>
<P>Of the eight trials analysed, those receiving the Chinese herbal intervention were more than twice as likely (RR 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.82) to have normalised their fasting blood glucose compared to those receiving lifestyle modification only (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of diabetes refers to the number of participants who had progressed to type 2 diabetes according to WHO or ADA criteria by the end of the trial.</P>
<P>Eight trials reported on the incidence of diabetes in the groups (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). There was a significant difference in the incidence of diabetes in favour of the Chinese herbal medicines following Tang Keng Yin tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang B 2004</LINK>). When the results of the eight trials were pooled there was a significant difference found in favour of the Chinese herbal medicines compared to the lifestyle intervention alone (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.58). All except three of these trials had a duration of more than 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang B 2004</LINK> ran for one month, <LINK REF="STD-Hao-AZ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hao AZ 2004</LINK> ran for two months, and <LINK REF="STD-Yao-Z-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yao Z 2001</LINK> for three months).</P>
<P>In the pooling of results on these two measures there was no considerable statistical heterogeneity among the comparisons (normalisation of fasting blood glucose: I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66%; incidence of diabetes: I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). It is important to note that there was clinical heterogeneity. The Chinese herbal medicines used in the clinical trials analysed are wide ranging in their ingredients. These ingredients are used for a variety of different clinical purposes. However, they may still be considered as 'class' or 'group' of oral hypoglycaemic herbal medicines. But any pooled effect size should be interpreted only as crude indicator of the overall direction of the findings. Nevertheless, these findings show that participants receiving Chinese herbal medicines were less likely to develop diabetes and more likely to have normal blood glucose than those in the control group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 19:05:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Sixteen randomised trials were included in this review. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity in the interventions of the included studies. In the 16 studies lasting four weeks to two years there were eight different comparisons, with 15 unique herbal formulations investigated.</P>
<P>In this systematic review we found evidence from eight trials that Chinese herbal medicines combined with lifestyle modification were significantly better at normalising blood glucose levels then lifestyle modification alone (RR 2.07; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.82). In a meta-analysis of eight trials, those receiving Chinese herbs were also more likely to have a reduced incidence of diabetes (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.58). In the pooling of the results for the meta-analyses of the two measures of normalising blood glucose and incidence of diabetes there was no considerable statistical heterogeneity among the comparisons (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66% and I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, respectively). It is important to note that there is a clinical difference in the herbal composition of these interventions and likely a difference in the active components. But these Chinese herbal medicines are not completely dissimilar. They form part of a 'group' of herbal medicines with hypoglycaemic effects designed to normalised elevated blood glucose and prevent diabetes. The population groups according to age, gender and ethnicity were similar. However, any pooled effect size should be interpreted only as a crude indicator of the overall direction of the findings. Further, all of these trials had a high risk of bias. Specifically, none of these trials were blinded and three of the trials reported unclear randomisation procedures. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that participants receiving Chinese herbs were less likely to develop diabetes and more likely to have normal blood glucose than those in the control group. The result therefore provides guidance for future research not for specific clinical practice.</P>

<P>The age and gender of participants in the included trials was representative of the general global population showing IGT (<LINK REF="REF-IDF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF 2008</LINK>).

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-10 19:11:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Thirteen of the 16 trials included in this review demonstrated a risk of bias in at least two of several key criteria: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, outcome assessors and intervention providers; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Details of sequence generation and concealment allocation were only reported in one of the published papers. Trial authors were contacted to clarify details. We found that nine trials had used adequate sequence generation methods (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-GJ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fan GJ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lu X 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-AS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wei AS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang B 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-YH-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng YH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-DY-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou DY 2003</LINK>). Allocation concealment was less frequently understood or adequately performed, with only five of the trial authors providing satisfactory details when questioned (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-AS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wei AS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-YH-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng YH 2006</LINK>). Empirical evidence suggests that failure to meet these criteria, such as adequate allocation concealment, is associated with overestimates of effect.</P>
<P>In clarifying risk of bias with authors it was apparent that the concept of randomisation was not always fully understood.  Of the 83 full papers retrieved, 34 claimed to be randomised but after contacting authors only 17 of these were truly randomised (50%). This is lower than the findings of a Cochrane review of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of common cold which found more than 95% of the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall only three of the 16 included trials were well designed and had a fairly low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>). The insufficient number of trials prohibited us from performing meaningful sensitivity analyses to clarify robustness of the review results to the exclusion of trials with inadequate methodology.</P>
<P>The double-blind, placebo controlled trial of <I>Dan zhi jiang tang jiao </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Fang-ZH-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang ZH 2007</LINK>) reported a significant improvement in 2 hr-oGTT blood glucose, insulin and triglycerides but there was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose. The method of sequence generation and allocation concealment was not reported in the trial but deemed adequate after an interview with one of the authors.</P>
<P>A second double-blind trial compared <I>Bofu-Tsusho-San </I>plus lifestyle modification versus placebo plus lifestyle modification in 81 people over six months. Peope randomised to <I>Bofu-Tsusho-San </I>plus lifestyle modification demonstrated a significantly improved fasting blood glucose but not 2hr-oGTT blood glucose (<LINK REF="STD-Hioki-C-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hioki C 2004</LINK>). There was no significant difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between those taking <I>Bofu-Tsusho-San </I>and the control group.</P>
<P>The third double-blind trial, comparing <I>Qi wei jiangtang yin </I>with placebo, demonstrated a significant improvement in the rate of normalisation of fasting blood glucose, reduction of fasting blood glucose, and 2hr-oGTT (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-BQ-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang BQ 2008</LINK>) in those randomised to the placebo group. This trial had a duration of 24 months and a low risk of bias as well as an adequately powered sample. However, as there are no other trials of this herbal medicine in this population group, these results cannot be seen as definitive.</P>
<P>There were few trials (n = 4) that collected HbA1c data. This will be an important outcome measure to collect in future trials. According to the American Diabetes Association Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation, the HbA1c will become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many of the trials it is possible that the statistical power may not have been adequate.  Several studies have reported rates of natural reversion to normal glucose levels of one third to one half for participants identified with IGT (<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riccardi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riccardi 1985</LINK>).  Moreover, rates of reversion to normal glucose levels appeared independent of the duration of follow-up, with a range of two months to 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Rambod-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambod 2009</LINK>). The rate of reversion needs to be built into statistical calculations of the power required to detect a difference in blood glucose and other outcomes.</P>
<P>Twelve of the 16 trials had lifestyle modifications as a co-intervention, all but two trials failed to provide any details on the nature of this intervention. Without thorough details, replication of the trials to build evidence for these interventions is not possible. Further this operates as a potentially confounding factor and calls into question the veracity of the results.</P>
<P>Overall the positive evidence in favour of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance is constrained by the following factors: a lack of trials that tested the same medicine, lack of details on co-interventions, unclear methods of randomisation, poor reporting and other risks of bias.</P>

<P>We have tried to reduce bias by contacting all trial authors to clarify the methods of randomisation. In this way we were able to eliminate trials that were only quasi-randomised.  Nonetheless we were unable to contact the authors of five of the included trials to clarify the methods of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Hao-AZ-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hao AZ 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-CP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li CP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qu-LX-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qu LX 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-YX-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang YX 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:40:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The available evidence suggests that some Chinese herbal medicines could be considered as a potential treatment in people with impaired glucose tolerance and reduce the incidence of diabetes. Given the sources of potential bias further evidence is required to confirm these trends. A separate systematic review on the efficacy of lifestyle education concluded that lifestyle education was clearly effective for reducing two-hour plasma glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test and the incidence of type 2 diabetes over one year (<LINK REF="REF-Yamaoka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamaoka 2005</LINK>). Our review adds to this growing body of evidence, in 80% of the included trials lifestyle modification was used as a co-intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:32:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Further trials are required before any conclusions can confidently be reached about the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and the delay of diabetes onset.</P>
<P>Future trials need to be designed in such a way as to address the risk of bias identified in the trials reviewed here. It is essential that such trials have adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment and that these methods are clearly reported. Ideally, future trials will involve a control of a pharmacological nature or be placebo-controlled. The Chinese herbal medicines and the control intervention need to be manufactured in such a way that participants and intervention providers can be blinded. If a lifestyle modification is to be used as a co-intervention or control this should be described in detail. The rate of reversion to normal blood glucose needs to be built into statistical calculations of the power of the trial required to detect a difference in blood glucose and other outcomes. Along with fasting blood glucose outcomes, other measurements of efficacy and safety should include glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), health-related quality of life, death from any cause, diabetic complications, economic outcomes and adverse events. </P>
<P>All future Chinese herbal medicines trials should be reported according to the elaborated CONSORT statement for reporting randomised controlled trials of herbal medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>We chose to alter the way in which the assessment of methodological quality was conducted and focus on a risk of bias assessment as a more useful analysis of the individual trials rather than using the tool originally described in the protocol.</P>
<P>Rather than using fixed effect modelling for continuous data as per the protocol the authors determined that a random-effects model was more appropriate for the relatively heterogeneous nature of herbal medicines. It would not be expected that different herbal formulations would produce the same quantity but that the different interventions would produce a distribution in magnitude of effects on any given outcome.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk (RR) ratios rather than odds ratios (OR). This method has been changed since the publication of the protocol to reflect the approach used by other studies in this modality of treatment. It is also a more easily understood statistic in presenting these outcomes.</P>
<P>A high level of statistical heterogeneity was found in the comparison of Chinese herbal medicines with lifestyle modification vs lifestyle modification alone on nearly all outcomes. For this reason subgroup analyses were undertaken. Due to the nature of the trials included the subgroup analyses varied from those set out in the trial protocol.</P>
