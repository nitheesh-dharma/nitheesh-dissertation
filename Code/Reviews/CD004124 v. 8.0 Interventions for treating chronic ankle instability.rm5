<TITLE>Chronic lateral ankle instability may be treated with or without surgery</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-06 12:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Chronic ankle instability is common after an acute lateral ankle sprain. Initial treatment is conservative, either with bracing or neuromuscular training. However, if symptoms persist and the ligaments on the outside of the ankle are elongated or torn, surgery is usually considered.</P>
<P>This review includes 10 small and flawed trials that recruited a total of 388 people with chronic ankle instability. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials meant that it was difficult to be certain that their results were valid.</P>
<P>Three trials compared neuromuscular training with no training. These found a programme of neuromuscular training appears to provide short term improvement in functional stability. One trial testing the use of a special cycle pedal found that it did not make an important difference to function. However, none of these four trials followed-up patients after the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Four trials compared different types of surgical intervention. There was insufficient evidence to strongly support any specific surgical procedure for treating chronic ankle instability. Two trials found that, after surgical reconstruction, early functional rehabilitation enabled patients to return to work and sports quicker than six weeks immobilisation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-04-18 16:22:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, all to February 2010.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-10-25 04:47:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bill Gillespie">
<P>All identified randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of interventions for chronic lateral ankle instability were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-10-25 04:47:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bill Gillespie">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-06 12:24:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Ten randomised controlled trials were included. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials resulted in unclear or high risk of bias assessments relating to allocation concealment, assessor blinding, incomplete and selective outcome reporting. Only limited pooling of the data was possible.</P>
<P>Neuromuscular training was the basis of conservative treatment evaluated in four trials. Neuromuscular training compared with no training resulted in better ankle function scores at the end of four weeks training (Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT): mean difference (MD) 3.00, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.70; 1 trial, 19 participants; Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) data: MD 8.83, 95% CI 4.46 to 13.20; 2 trials, 56 participants). The fourth trial (19 participants) found no significant difference in the functional outcome after six weeks training programme on a cyclo-ergometer with a bi-directional compared with a traditional uni-directional pedal. Longer-term follow-up data were not available for these four trials.</P>
<P>Four studies compared surgical procedures for chronic ankle instability. One trial (40 participants) found more nerve injuries after tenodesis than anatomical reconstruction (risk ratio (RR) 5.50, 95% CI 1.39 to 21.71). One trial (99 participants) comparing dynamic versus static tenodesis excluded 17 patients allocated dynamic tenodesis because their tendons were too thin. The same trial found that dynamic tenodesis resulted in higher numbers of people with unsatisfactory function (RR 8.62, 95% CI 1.97 to 37.77, 82 participants). One trial comparing techniques of lateral ankle ligament reconstruction (60 participants) found that operating time was shorter using the reinsertion technique than the imbrication method (MD -9.00 minutes, 95% CI -13.48 to -4.52).<BR/>
<BR/>Two trials (70 participants) compared functional mobilisation with immobilisation after surgery. These found early mobilisation led to earlier return to work (MD -2.00 weeks, 95% CI -3.06 to -0.94; 1 trial) and to sports (MD -3.00 weeks, 95% CI -4.49 to -1.51; 1 trial).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-06 12:06:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Neuromuscular training alone appears effective in the short term but whether this advantage would persist on longer-term follow-up is not known. While there is insufficient evidence to support any one surgical intervention over another surgical intervention for chronic ankle instability, it is likely that there are limitations to the use of dynamic tenodesis. After surgical reconstruction, early functional rehabilitation appears to be superior to six weeks immobilisation in restoring early function.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-05 18:26:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-05 18:26:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Damage to the lateral ankle ligaments by forced inversion of the ankle joint (outward snapping of the ankle relative to the foot) is one of the most common lower limb injuries. In most people, only the anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL, the front ligament on the outside ankle) is affected but in a minority this is combined with a rupture of the calcaneo-fibular ligament (CFL, the middle ankle ligament on the outside ankle) (<LINK REF="REF-Brostrom-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brostrom 1966</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although surgical treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ankle ligaments probably gives slightly better functional results than conservative treatment, it is unclear whether this compensates for a higher risk of complications, higher costs and required operation time (<LINK REF="REF-Kerkhoffs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerkhoffs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pijnenburg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijnenburg 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conservative treatment leads to full functional recovery in most people (<LINK REF="REF-Kerkhoffs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerkhoffs 2007</LINK>). However, up to 20% continue to suffer from lateral ankle instability, characterised by recurrent ankle sprains or a feeling of apprehension in the ankle (giving way). If this persists for longer than six months, the terms 'chronic (lateral) ankle instability' (CAI) is used (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to the 1960s, it was assumed that chronic ankle instability was mechanical in origin, resulting from structural laxity of the injured ankle ligaments. This 'mechanical instability' (MI) can be assessed by physical and radiological examination, using the anterior drawer test and the ankle inversion test (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 1996</LINK>). However, it is now clear that chronic ankle instability may occur with or without increased ligament laxity (<LINK REF="REF-Bozkurt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozkurt 2006</LINK>). Nor does increased ligament laxity always result in symptomatic instability. These observations have led to the concept that functional instability (FI) resulting from a neuromuscular deficit is implicated along with mechanical instability in people with symptoms of chronic ankle instability (<LINK REF="STD-Halasi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Halasi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hertel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-12 11:20:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Initial treatment of chronic ankle instability may therefore consist of neuromuscular training of the ankle. Several training programmes have been developed. This may be supplemented by external ankle support, e.g. tape or a brace (<LINK REF="REF-Richie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richie 2001</LINK>). If, after a programme of rehabilitation, symptoms persist and increased ligament laxity is present, surgical treatment is usually considered (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical procedures fall into two main categories. In "anatomic" reconstructions (<LINK REF="REF-Brostrom-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brostrom 1966</LINK>), the previously ruptured ligaments are tightened by overlapping (imbrication) or by re-attaching one end of the ligament into the bone (reinsertion). In 'non-anatomic' reconstructions, the structural laxity is corrected using other tissues, normally tendon (tenodesis) (<LINK REF="REF-Chrisman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrisman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1953</LINK>). Retrospective comparative studies seem to suggest that anatomic reconstructions show superior results in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Krips-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krips 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-20 14:56:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of neuromuscular rehabilitation is to optimise lower limb postural control and restore active stability by training (<LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2008</LINK>). The aim of surgical reconstruction is the reduction of increased ligament laxity. Tape and braces may provide some external mechanical support for an unstable ankle, but it has also been suggested that the beneficial effect is explained by enhancement of proprioception (awareness of position, movement and balance) through skin pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Baier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baier 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-10-29 15:19:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The effectiveness of neuromuscular training needs to be formally evaluated. Also, it remains unclear whether and in what circumstances surgery is effective in management of chronic instability, with or without a component of neuromuscular rehabilitation), and which treatment programme provides the best balance of benefits and adverse effects. In this circumstance, a regularly updated review of evidence is important.</P>

All studies were published in English and peer reviewed medical journals between 1990 and 2008. They were all identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE or CINAHL. All studies evaluated people with chronic lateral ankle instability, although in three studies a pre-treatment duration of symptoms of more than six months was not explicitly mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK>). Since other inclusion criteria were met and according to the patient description a sufficient duration of complaints could be assumed, these studies were not excluded.</P>
<P>A total of 388 participants was randomised, of whom 333 were analysed at final follow-up. Mean or median age ranged from 19.5 to 29.7 years. The youngest recorded patient was 17 years and the oldest 49 years. In most studies both males and females were included, with a male participation rate varying from 39% to 100%. Two studies evaluated men only (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 10 included studies were divided into three groups: four studies evaluated conservative treatment in the form of different neuromuscular training programmes for chronic (functional) ankle instability (four studies); studies comparing different forms of surgical interventions for chronic ankle instability (four studies); and studies comparing different rehabilitation programmes after a surgical intervention for chronic ankle instability (two studies). This division is used in all following sections.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies comparing different programmes of neuromuscular training for chronic ankle instability</HEADING>
<P>All four studies in this category were designed as pre-test/ post-test randomised trials without a follow-up period. In three of the four studies, a four-week neuromuscular training programme was compared with no training (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>). The programmes consisted of 8 to 12 supervised training sessions of 20 to 30 minutes in four weeks, comprising multiple (balance) exercises. In <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>, participants also had to train at home in the last two weeks. Group size varied from nine to 16 people with chronic ankle instability. In the fourth study, training with an experimental bi-directional pedal on a cyclo-ergometer (n = 10) was compared to training with a standard uni-directional pedal (n = 9) during a six-week training programme (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK>). All four studies combined functional scores as outcome measure with physiologic outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> used the Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT) questionnaire, <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK> the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and the FADI Sport, and <LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK> assessed functional outcome with a modified Karlsson ankle score.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies comparing different surgical procedures for chronic ankle instability</HEADING>
<P>None of the four studies evaluated exactly the same comparison, although two studies compared an anatomical reconstruction with a tenodesis (<LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK> compared the outcome after a modified Broström anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments with the Chrisman-Snook tenodesis in 40 people. The main outcome measure was the Sefton ankle score. <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK> compared a modified Evans tenodesis with an anatomical reconstruction in 20 males. The main outcome measures were range of motion and mechanical stability. <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1997</LINK> compared two different anatomic reconstructions in 60 people. In one group, the lateral ligaments were shortened by reinsertion onto the distal fibula and reinforced by a periosteal flap. In the other group, the ligaments were imbricated (shortening of the ligament itself) and the reconstruction was reinforced by the inferior extensor retinaculum. The main outcome measure was the Karlsson ankle score. <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990</LINK> compared a dynamic tenodesis (26 people) with a static (Winfield) tenodesis (56 people). In the static tenodesis, an anatomic reconstruction according to the authors, the full-thickness distal end of the peroneus was used to reconstruct both the anterior talofibular ligament and the calcaneofibular ligament. In the dynamic variant, the distal brevis tendon was split longitudinally and the anterior half was used for dynamic repair. The main outcome measure for <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990</LINK> was a self-designed clinical ankle score.</P>

The walking boot is a prefabricated brace that allows only for a preset plantar- and dorsiflexion range of motion. Participants in this group started with two weeks of immobilisation after which range of motion was gradually extended. After six weeks, both groups started with the same supervised rehabilitation programme. Main outcome measures were the Karlsson ankle score, range of motion and return to work and sports. <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1999</LINK> compared six weeks of immobilisation with controlled range of motion in an Air-Cast ankle brace after an anatomic reconstruction in 30 patients. During the first two weeks only free plantar and dorsiflexion was allowed in the brace group. Then two weeks of controlled range of motion was conducted. In weeks five and six, this was combined with co-ordination and strength training. After six weeks, both groups underwent the same rehabilitation programme again. The main outcome measure was the Karlsson ankle score.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-06 12:49:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The 10 included studies fell in three clearly distinct groups comprising four studies comparing different neuromuscular interventions for chronic ankle instability, four studies comparing different surgical techniques for chronic ankle instability, and two studies comparing different rehabilitation programmes after surgery. There were only limited opportunities for pooling of data, and few statistically significant differences in functional outcomes between groups.</P>
<P>Data from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>) showed a better outcome for neuromuscular training compared with no training at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK>) found that training on a bicycle with a bi-directional pedal did not significantly improve ankle function compared with training on a bicycle with a standard uni-directional pedal at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Two small randomised studies have compared non-anatomic versus anatomic reconstruction, each with a different non-anatomic surgical reconstruction. Pooled data for participants with instability or pain at follow-up did not show significant differences between the two operations. In <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK>, nerve injury was more frequent after non-anatomic reconstruction. In <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK>, radiological measurement of ankle laxity showed that anatomic repair provided better correction of talar tilt.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1997</LINK>), comparing two anatomic reconstruction techniques, found no difference in any clinical outcome at follow-up but operation time was significantly shorter in the reinsertion group.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990</LINK>) comparing dynamic versus static tenodesis reported two outcomes favouring static tenodesis - fewer participants reported poor function, or had radiological instability.</P>
<P>Pooling of data from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1999</LINK>) comparing plaster immobilisation with early mobilisation and range of motion training in a brace found earlier return to work in the early mobilisation group; this may have reflected the significantly higher range of motion in the same groups at six weeks. Differences between the two groups at long-term follow-up in range of motion and functional outcome were, however, not statistically significant.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-06 12:51:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>None of the included studies have compared surgery alone versus functional rehabilitation alone, or surgery and functional rehabilitation versus functional rehabilitation alone. No randomised studies evaluating orthotics were identified.</P>
<P>The search and selection of studies led to the inclusion of 10 trials, and the discovery of two others that await further assessment.</P>
<P>In respect of external validity, the included studies are somewhat heterogeneous. In all studies interventions were described adequately, but only two studies used standardised protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1997</LINK>). Inclusion criteria were adequately described in all studies. In five studies, the exclusion criteria were clearly described as well (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>). The other studies did not describe exclusion criteria or only mentioned a few criteria that did not exclude all conditions that could influence outcome.</P>
<P>Care programmes other than the investigated treatment were comparable or not applicable (pre-test/post-test design) in all studies.</P>
<P>Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990</LINK>) reported active follow-up of more than one year. <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK> did not evaluate functional outcome.</P>
<P>The four small studies evaluating the effectiveness of neuromuscular training in chronic ankle instability (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>) reported mainly physiological outcome measures, which were outside the scope of this review. However, they did report the results of validated patient-derived functional scores which, in three studies, demonstrated short-term effectiveness. It is not known whether this advantage persists on longer-term follow-up, nor is the clinical significance of the beneficial effect clear.</P>

<P>Although it is generally assumed that both surgical reconstruction, and non-operative functional rehabilitation have a beneficial effect on symptomatic chronic ankle instability, this impression is not based on high level clinical evidence. Although the first CONSORT statement was published in 1996, it is unlikely to have influenced the conduct or reporting of any of the six studies of surgical procedures or of rehabilitation after surgery published before 2000. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of the trials resulted in judgements of unclear or high risk of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias in one or more trials.<BR/>
<BR/>A high risk of detection bias resulted in the GRADE assessment of "moderate" for the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00f8_iness-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Høiness 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>) evaluating neuromuscular training. However, the lack of post-treatment follow-up is a major failing in all four studies.</P>
<P>High risk of bias from various defects such as lack of blinding, selective reporting, incomplete outcome data together with problems with external validity resulted in a GRADE assessment of "poor" for all the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbaum 1999</LINK>) comparing different surgical procedures.</P>
<P>A high risk of bias resulting for reporting bias led to a GRADE assessment of "moderate" for the two studies comparing early mobilisation versus immobilisation after surgery.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-06-21 09:59:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Four systematic reviews evaluating conservative treatment options for chronic ankle instability have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-McKeon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeon 2008a;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Wees-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Wees 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>). Three of these (<LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-McKeon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeon 2008a;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>) included non-randomised trials as well, and two reviews (<LINK REF="REF-McKeon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeon 2008a;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Wees-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Wees 2006</LINK>) also evaluated prevention after an acute ankle injury. In accordance with the current review, although partially based on lower levels of evidence, in three of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Loudon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loudon 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Wees-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Wees 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>) it was concluded that conservative measures, mainly neuromuscular training, are effective as treatment for chronic ankle instability. Only <LINK REF="REF-McKeon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeon 2008a</LINK> did not find a positive effect of neuromuscular training. However, this was not in accordance with a study by the same author the same year (<LINK REF="STD-McKeon-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">McKeon 2008b</LINK>). Two other studies that were included in the current review (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2007</LINK>) and also showed a positive effect of training, were not evaluated in <LINK REF="REF-McKeon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeon 2008a</LINK>. No systematic reviews evaluating surgical treatment for chronic lateral ankle instability were identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-05 22:19:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the small size of the study populations, the moderate to high risk of bias of the studies, and clinical heterogeneity, this review does not provide strong evidence on which to base practice. Neuromuscular training appears to improve ankle function in the short term but it is unclear whether this advantage is clinically relevant and there is no evidence available on longer term outcome. There is insufficient evidence to support any one surgical intervention over another surgical intervention for chronic ankle instability. However, the practical limitations of dynamic tenodesis in terms of tendon thickness impose some restrictions on the use of this technique. In order to reduce the time to return to work and sports, rehabilitation after surgery for chronic ankle instability should be functional, with early mobilisation of the ankle joint, rather than six weeks of immobilisation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-04 18:44:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for sufficiently powered, high quality and well-reported randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) evaluating the treatment of chronic ankle instability, including an analysis of cost effectiveness. For all trials, including those evaluating neuromuscular training programmes, a sufficient follow-up period is important. There is a need for trials evaluating the effectiveness of orthotic devices for the treatment of chronic ankle instability.</P>
