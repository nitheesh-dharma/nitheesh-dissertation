<TITLE>Glucocorticoids for rheumatoid arthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-16 22:25:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of low dose glucocorticoid pills, such as prednisone, on the progress of rheumatoid arthritis. The review shows that:</P>
<P>
<B>In people with rheumatoid arthritis, low dose glucocorticoid pills:</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>- reduce the progression of the disease on x-rays over 1 to 2 years.</P>
<P>This result is based on high quality evidence.</P>
<P>This benefit occurred in people already taking a disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD) and therefore this benefit is over and above any benefits from the DMARDs.<BR/>
<BR/>These results were true in people that had rheumatoid arthritis for less than 2 years. It seems likely that glucocorticoids would have the same effect in people who have had rheumatoid for 3 to 4 years, but it is not known whether this is true in people who have had it for longer.</P>
<P>The long term effects of glucocorticoids are not known.</P>
<P>
<B>What is rheumatoid arthritis and why use glucocorticoids?</B>
<BR/>Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints (especially in the hands and feet) and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat in the joint (inflammation). Glucocorticoids are also known as glucocorticosteroids, or sometimes just 'steroids', although there are many other types of steroids. They are taken as pills for up to 7 months and have already been shown to improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. There is however still some concern about the long term harms, such as heart problems, when taking glucocorticoids.</P>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis also breaks down and erodes away the cartilage and bones in the affected joints. This erosion cannot be seen and is measured by x-rays. More erosion on an x-ray usually means that the disease is progressing or worsening. There is some debate about whether glucocorticoids can slow the erosion and the progression of the disease.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the effects of glucocorticoids on the progress of rheumatoid arthritis?</B>
<BR/>The studies looked at people who had rheumatoid for up to 2 years. Low doses of glucocorticoid pills were taken and usually with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD).</P>
<P>Glucocorticoids reduce progression of the disease on x-rays over 1 to 2 years. This result is based on high quality evidence.</P>
<P>Harms were not reviewed. We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects and long term side effects. Low doses of glucocorticoids may not lead to side effects, but possible side effects may include osteoporosis or heart problems.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Glucocorticoid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is widespread. Two Cochrane Reviews have been published examining the short term clinical benefit of low dose glucocorticoids compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and demonstrate good short term and medium term clinical benefits. The possibility that glucocorticoids may have a fundamental 'disease modifying' effect in RA, which would be seen by a reduction in the rate of radiological progression, has been raised by several authors.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To perform a systematic review of studies evaluating glucocorticoid efficacy in inhibiting the progression of radiological damage in rheumatoid arthritis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to 22 February 2005) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was undertaken, using the terms 'corticosteroids' and 'rheumatoid arthritis' expanded according to the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. Identified abstracts were reviewed and appropriate reports obtained in full. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists and from expert knowledge. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled or cross-over trials in adults with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in which prednisone or a similar glucocorticoid preparation was compared to either placebo controls or active controls (i.e. comparative studies) and where there was evaluation of radiographs of hands, or hands and feet, or feet by any standardised technique. Eligible studies had at least one treatment arm with glucocorticoids and one without glucocorticoids.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Standardised data extraction obtained the mean and standard deviation (SD) of change in erosion scores over 1 year or 2 years. (Where SD for change was not given a conservative estimate was taken from baseline data.) At least two authors selected the studies and extracted the data. Radiographic erosion scores were expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score for the method used. The results were pooled after weighting in a random effects model to provide a standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The initial search produced 217 citations, and 15 were added from experts, abstracts and review of reference lists. Authors of 4 trials being prepared for publication (and subsequently published) kindly shared their data. After application of eligibility criteria 15 studies and 1,414 patients were included. The majority of trials studied early RA (disease duration up to 2 years), and the mean cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 2,300 mg prednisone equivalent (range 270 mg - 5,800 mg) over the first year. Glucocorticoids were mostly added to other disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD) treatment. The standardised mean difference in progression was 0.40 in favour of glucocorticoids (95% CI 0.27, 0.54). In studies lasting 2 years (806 patients included), the standardised mean difference in progression in favour of glucocorticoids at 1 year was 0.45 (0.24, 0.66) and at 2 years was 0.42 (0.30, 0.55). All studies except one showed a numerical treatment effect in favour of glucocorticoids. The beneficial effects of glucocorticoids were generally achieved when used in conjunction with other DMARD treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Even in the most conservative estimate, the evidence that glucocorticoids given in addition to standard therapy can substantially reduce the rate of erosion progression in rheumatoid arthritis is convincing. There remains concern about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy, such as increased cardiovascular risk, and this issue requires further research.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Glucocorticoid use in RA is currently widespread with up to 80% of patients using prednisone or similar glucocorticoid preparations in many arthritis practices (<LINK REF="REF-Byron-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byron 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 1996</LINK>). Despite a relative paucity of published data, several authors have debated the value of glucocorticoids for the treatment of RA (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Remus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Remus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1989</LINK>). Two Cochrane Reviews have been published examining the short term (&lt;2 weeks) clinical benefit of low dose glucocorticoids compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 1997</LINK>) and moderate term (about seven months) clinical benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Criswell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criswell 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>In these meta-analyses, the authors focused on disease activity outcome measures routinely included in arthritis clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1990</LINK>). It was recognised that these measures of disease activity are not a substitute for long-term evaluation of disease progression, most often assessed by radiographic changes. The possibility that glucocorticoids may have a more fundamental, 'disease modifying' effect in RA, which would be seen by a reduction in the rate of radiological progression, has been raised by several authors (<LINK REF="REF-Byron-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byron 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1989</LINK>). Meta-analysis has previously been used to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line therapies (so called disease modifying anti rheumatoid drugs, DMARDs), including glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-Petiti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petiti 1994</LINK>) but not all published studies were included and several more studies have since been published. We therefore undertook a similar analysis of the ability of low dose glucocorticoids (&lt;= 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent) to inhibit the radiological progression of RA.</P>

<B>Data collection </B>
<BR/>Data from the trials were independently extracted by two reviewers and disagreement was resolved by a third, blinded assessment. Trials were not blinded as to authors or institutions. A standard data extraction form was used to extract the following information:<BR/>Characteristics of the study population: <BR/>

<LI>Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality. Disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer.</LI>

<P>
<BR/>
<B>Data analysis <BR/>
</B>Data analysis employed a standard meta-analysis using methods for continuous data developed by Hedges and Olkin (<LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1982</LINK>) and described by Petiti (<LINK REF="REF-Petiti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petiti 1994</LINK>). A random effects model was used. The scale for radiographic assessment varied among the studies. Radiographic erosion scores for each study were therefore expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score for the method used. </P>
<P>Where the mean and standard deviation of the change in radiographic score was provided for the glucocorticoid and control arms, we calculated a standardized mean difference between them. If the standard deviations of the change scores were not available we used the standard deviation of the baseline scores for each group. This provides a conservative estimate of the significance of differences between groups. For some studies we sought clarification from the first author.</P>
<P>We analysed the outcome at one year in all studies included (Comparison 01 subgroup 01) , and at one and two years in studies which reported outcomes at two years (Comparison 01 subgroups 02 and 03). <U>
<BR/>
</U>
<BR/>
<B>Clinical relevance tables <BR/>
</B>Clinical relevance tables were compiled under additional tables to improve the readability of the review. Absolute benefit was calculated as the change in the intervention group minus the change in the control group, in the original units. Relative benefit in the change from baseline was calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the change in the control group.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses<BR/>
</B>Sensitivity analyses were determined prior to collection of the data and included: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>including only studies where glucocorticoids were taken with specific anti-rheumatoid drugs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, DMARD) (Comparison 02)</LI>
<LI>including only studies where glucocorticoids were taken without specific anti-rheumatoid drugs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, DMARD) (Comparison 03)</LI>
<LI>including only studies using fixed low dose oral glucocorticoid (up to 7.5 mg prednisolone equivalent daily) (Comparison 04)</LI>
<LI>including only studies using step-down treatment (starting at a higher dose and reducing over the following weeks or months) (Comparison 05)</LI>
<LI>including only studies with less than 26 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment (Comparison 06)</LI>

<LI>Including only studies with blind assessors (Comparison 15)</LI>
<LI>examining changes at 1 year and at 2 years (Subgroups 02 and 03 in each comparison)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Secondary analyses<BR/>
</B>Several trials reported only P-values or nonparametric analyses, and we know that usually the results of radiograph changes show a skewed distribution without providing the mean and standard deviation of the change scores for each treatment group. In such cases, parametric analysis may cause loss of precision. Therefore, as a secondary analysis, we modeled a standard deviation in the following way. We translated the statistical significance (2-tailed P value) of the original trial result or test into a Student's t-score. Using the sample size and the mean or imputed mean we could then calculate a standard deviation for differences in group changes that would have resulted from normally distributed data. These model standard deviations were then used to estimate or calculate the SD of the group change scores, and these were incorporated in this secondary meta-analysis (Comparisons 09-11). The trials to which this was applied are reported in the review of individual trial data below.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>As an aid to working we adopted study labels which had meaning at the time, but are now arbitrary. However, we have continued to use the same labels to avoid misunderstanding.</P>
<P>The initial search produced 217 citations, and 15 were added from experts, abstracts and review of reference lists. Authors of 4 trials then being prepared for publication kindly shared their data. These studies have since been published in full. After application of eligibility criteria 15 studies and 1,414 patients were included. The majority of trials studied early RA (disease duration up to 2 years). Two studies (reported in several publications) were published between 1955 and 1960, and are not currently available in the electronic archive. A third was published in 1993. In 1986, Byron and Kirwan (<LINK REF="REF-Byron-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byron 1986</LINK>) published a proposal for further scrutiny of the effects of glucocorticoids on x-ray progression. Subsequent studies were published in 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaardenburg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schaardenburg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Gestel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">van Gestel 1995</LINK>), 1997 (<LINK REF="STD-Boers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boers 1997</LINK>), 1999 (<LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1999</LINK>), 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2001</LINK>); 2004 (<LINK REF="STD-Capell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Capell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suponitskaia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suponitskaia 2004</LINK>), and 2005 (<LINK REF="STD-Choy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Choy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goekoop-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Goekoop 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wassenberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wassenberg 2005</LINK>). Descriptions of the studies are given under 'Characteristics of included studies'. The relationship and cross references between the published studies is illustrated in Additional <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The mean cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 2,300 mg prednisone equivalent (range 270 mg - 5,800 mg) over the first year. Glucocorticoids were mostly added to other DMARD treatment. Details of individual treatment regimens are set out in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The analysis of methodological quality is given in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In general, recent studies are of high quality. Several studies were instigated in the early years of the introduction of the methodology of randomised controlled clinical trials, and were written for a relatively small audience of clinical specialists who knew each other well. These studies were landmarks at the time of their publication, but the study reports may omit details (such as precise descriptions of the outcome assessments used) that would now be considered essential for a full understanding of the study results.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>
<BR/>Data were available after 1 year of treatment and follow up for 49 patients in the intervention group and 54 patients in the control group.

<P>Additional data extracted from the text or calculated from the data provided included the proportion of non-erosive hands which had developed erosions. In the prednisolone group these were: at 1 year 26.5% and at 2 years 22.1%. In the placebo group these were: at 1 year 38% and at 2 years 45.6% (P= 0.296 and P=0.108 respectively, Chi-squared test). An additional outcome calculated from the data provided was the proportion of patients who showed progression in year 0-1 (glucocorticoid 14/49, placebo 27/55) and years 0-2 (glucocorticoid 12/44, placebo 28/52). Additional data on the outcome of double blind withdrawal of treatment are available in <LINK REF="REF-Hickling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickling 1998</LINK>.

<BR/>Data from this study were kindly provided by the lead author and have subsequently been published. Data were available at 1and 2 years of treatment and follow up. An estimate of the number of patients with available change scores on x-rays after 1 year and 2 years was made based on the ratios of patients in the treated and control groups at baseline and 2 years. This estimate was: prednisolone group had 102 at year 1 and 107 year 2; control group had 112 at year 1 and 118 year 2.</P>
<P>Additional data included the development of erosions in previously unaffected joints. Medians (inter-quartile ranges) for year 0-1 were: prednisolone group 0 (0-1); control group 0.5 (0-2); P (Mann-Whitney) = 0.004. For year 0-2 these were: prednisolone group 0.5 (0-2); control group 1.25 (0-3.25); P (Mann-Whitney) = 0.007.</P>

Table VIII in the report provided the number of patients falling into categorical scores (on a Likert scale) for pre-treatment and one year post-treatment assessments. From this we constructed a table showing the most conservative interpretation of individual patient change scores, and hence calculated a mean and standard deviation for change scores over 1 year. The data provided do not allow the derivation of combined hand and feet scores for individual patients. Mean change scores were therefore available for year 0 to year 2, but no standard deviations. We estimated these standard deviations as the same proportion of the mean as was calculated for the year 0 to year 1 change scores. We calculated a model SD of the difference scores for a secondary analysis (as described in statistical methods). We used these model SDs as an estimate for the SD of the change score, and assumed this would be the same for both groups.</P>

<B>Glucocorticoid dose</B>
<BR/>The mean cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 2,300 mg prednisone equivalent (range 270 mg - 5,800 mg) over the first year. Glucocorticoids were mostly added to other DMARD treatment. The details of the treatment comparisons are listed in 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>
<B>Disease duration</B>
<BR/>From the table of characteristics of included studies it can be seen that 5 studies did not report disease duration. Of the other 10, 1 had a median of 13 years and all the others had disease duration of less than 2 years. Therefore the results of this analysis apply principally to patients with short disease duration (&lt;2 years).</P>
<P>
<B>Meta-analysis result</B>
<BR/>Erosions. All studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Capell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Capell 2004</LINK>) showed a numerical treatment effect in favour of glucocorticoids. Figures section 01 shows the results from all studies (glucocorticoids vs. comparator). Figure 01-01 shows that the SMD in favour of glucocorticoids for change in erosions at 1 year was 0.39 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.52). Taking only those studies reporting two years of treatment (Figure 01-02) shows that the SMD in favour of glucocorticoids for change in erosions at 1 year was 0.41 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.66) and at 2 years was 0.42 (0.30, 0.55).</P>
<P>Joint Space Narrowing. Seven studies provided data about the progression of joint space narrowing (2 [<LINK REF="STD-van-Gestel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">van Gestel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goekoop-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Goekoop 2005</LINK>] over 1 year only, 1 [<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2001</LINK>] over 2 years only, and 3 [<LINK REF="STD-Schaardenburg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schaardenburg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Everdingen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van Everdingen 2002</LINK>] over 1 and 2 years). Figure 01-03 shows that the SMD in favour of glucocorticoids for change in joint space narrowing at 1 year was 0.36 (0.18, 0.53) and at 2 years was 0.31 (0.14, 0.49). Using only the studies including data for 1 and 2 years these figures are 0.31 (0.04, 0.58) for 1 year and 0.31 (0.13, 0.50) for 2 years.</P>
<P>Proportion of patients progressing. There were 4 studies in which the proportion of patients progressing during the study was given. The relative risk in favour of glucocorticoids was 0.60 (0.48, 0.74).</P>
<P>
<B>Clinical relevance</B>
<BR/>The change in scores in the original units is given in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for the comparator arm and for the glucocorticoid arm of each study. Absolute benefit was calculated as the change in the control group minus the change in the intervention group, in the original units and relative benefit in the change from baseline was calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the change in the control group (also included in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The proportion of benefit gained by glucocorticoids in reducing the progression of erosions from an average (95% CI) of all the studies over 1 year was 59.8% (45.4%, 74.1%). Using data only from trials lasting 2 years, the proportion of benefit gained by glucocorticoids in reducing the progression of erosions from an average of all the studies over 1 year was 67.2% (48.9%, 85.4%) and over 2 years was 61.3% (46.5%. 76.1%). These data are illustrated in Additional <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. It should be noted that the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids were generally achieved when used in conjunction with other DMARD treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity Analysis</B>
<BR/>The results from the sensitivity analysis of erosive progression and joint space narrowing can be viewed in the Comparison sections 02 to 08, each dealing with subsets of the trials as set out in the methods section above. </P>
<P>There were statistically significant reductions in the progression of erosions over 1 year and over 2 years in all subgroup analyses, irrespective of concomitant medication and length of study. Glucocorticoids were advantageous when studies in which they were given in conjunction with and compared to DMARDs plus NSAIDs were analysed. This was also true when only studies of low dose glucocorticoids were included. There was a significant benefit when step-down glucocorticoids taken with DMARDs plus NSAIDs were compared to DMARDs plus NSAIDs. There was a significant benefit when glucocorticoids were compared with NSAIDs in patients not taking DMARDs. Significant benefits were shown with treatment for less than 26 weeks and treatment for more than 26 weeks. Thus all groupings of the treatment combinations showed a significant reduction in the progression of erosions in patients treated with glucocorticoids.</P>
<P>As a second measure of radiographic progression the effect of glucocorticoids on joint space narrowing (JSN) was examined. As described above, JSN was reduced at 1 year in all glucocorticoid treated patients compared to all not treated with glucocorticoids. This was true at 1 year and 2 years in studies lasting two years. A similar result was found for the other subgroup analyses, although for some (step down glucocorticoids plus DMARD plus NSAID, studies with less than 26 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment) the difference between the groups was not always significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis by quality</B>
<BR/>Several of the studies were published at a time when study reports were not routinely required to include the quality information. <BR/>The quality standard with the greatest variability in reporting was Concealed Treatment. Of the 15 studies, only 12 provided information on which to judge concealment of treatment, and in only 6 studies was concealment of treatment adequate. An analysis of erosions at 2 years using only studies with concealed treatment (Comparison 12-03) showed an SMD in favour of glucocorticoids of 0.51 (95% CI 0.74 , 0.28). This is greater than with all studies taken together.</P>
<P>The quality standard which was next most variable in reporting was Blinding of Patients. Only 11 studies provided information on which to judge patient blinding, and in only 7 of these had patients been blinded. An analysis of erosions at 2 years using only patient blinded studies (Comparison 13-03) showed an SMD of 0.36 in favour of glucocorticoids (0.63, 0.10). This result is similar to the results of all studies combined.</P>
<P>The quality standard which was next most variable in reporting was Intention to Treat analysis, where 12 studies provided enough information on which to judge the analysis, and of these 9 studies reported this analysis. An analysis of erosions at 2 years using only these studies (Comparison 14-03) showed an SMD in favour of glucocorticoids of 0.33 (0.54 , 0.11). This result is similar to the results of all studies combined.</P>
<P>For the quality standard Blind Assessors, 13 studies provided enough information on which to judge and 12 included blinded assessors. An analysis of erosions at 2 years using only assessor blinded studies (Comparison 15-03) showed an SMD of 0.40 in favour of glucocorticoids (95% CI 0.56, 0.24). This result is the same as the results of all studies combined.</P>
<P>Other quality criteria were satisfied by 13 or 14 of the studies, and omitting the studies which did not satisfy the criteria made almost no difference to the analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary analyses<BR/>
</B>In the secondary analyses using modeled SDs for some trials (as described in methods), there were changes in only three informative studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suponitskaia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suponitskaia 2004</LINK>). In general these changes resulted in a larger SMD in favour of glucocorticoid treatment. For example, for all studies SMD for erosions at 1 year changed from 0.39 (Comparison 01, Outcome 01) to 0.42 (Comparison 09, Outcome 01). When only the three studies themselves are considered, SMD for erosions at 1 year changed from 0.35 (Comparison 11 Outcome 01) to 0.47 (Comparison 10, Outcome 01). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is a variety of valid methods for assessing the progression of radiographic damage in RA. For this analysis we placed all study results on a comparable scale by re-scoring each published result so that it was expressed as the percentage of the maximum possible score for the radiographic method used. It is seldom, if ever, that maximum scores are achieved in practice, so the absolute values of this rescaling are not a good representation of the severity of radiographic damage. Furthermore, whenever there was a choice of method for defining the outcome within a study, we chose to take the most conservative estimate of the difference between the patients treated with glucocorticoids and those on comparator treatment. Finally, our principal analysis included all studies with all types of glucocorticoid administration, even though it is possible (or even likely) that the efficacy of glucocorticoids depends on the detailed way in which it is administered (e.g. route of administration, use of concomitant medications).</P>
<P>Our secondary analysis applied a novel approach to redefining the results of three contributory studies so that they reflected, in our opinion, a more realistic representation of the effect of treatment on outcome. This increased the SMD in favour of glucocorticoids by 35% (from 0.35 to 0.47) in the studies concerned and by 8% when all the data were taken together. </P>
<P>Even using the conservative approach of our primary analysis, the results show a significant benefit in the reduction of radiographic erosion progression for glucocorticoid treatment compared to other treatments in patients with relatively early, active RA. This result is similar to that obtained by Jones and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>) who analysed 4 of the 5 trials that were published at that time, although only 3 were included in the meta-analysis calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Empire-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Empire 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joint-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Joint 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>), together with a study of pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1990</LINK>). Our sensitivity analyses looked at several different ways of combining the studies, and in all cases a similar benefit for glucocorticoid therapy was demonstrated. This was also found by Jones (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). Further, two other measures of radiographic progression - joint space narrowing and the number of patients who showed progressive change, also demonstrated a similar substantial benefit for glucocorticoid treatment. While not all individual studies showed a statistically significant benefit for treatment, all but one showed glucocorticoid treated patients to have a better radiographic outcome than comparator groups.</P>
<P>The SMD reported here is a conservative estimate because of the nature of the measurements made on the radiographs. Nevertheless, the proportion of benefit gained by glucocorticoids in reducing the progression of erosions from an average of all the studies over 1 year was 67.2% (CI 48.9%, 85.4%) and over 2 years was 61.3% (CI 46.5%. 76.1%). Furthermore, this benefit was achieved in patients who were (mostly) already receiving DMARD treatment. It therefore represents a gain over and above any benefits from DMARDs alone.</P>
<P>It should be recognised that the link between radiological benefit and overall long term functional benefit is not firmly established, and it does not necessarily follow that patients will gain long term functional benefit. However, taking different approaches, two authors (<LINK REF="REF-Kirwan-2001A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirwan 2001A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>) have concluded that there is an important link between them.</P>
<P>The potential for high doses of glucocorticoids to cause adverse effects is well known, but the doses used in many of the studies reported here were low. There have been no studies seeking radiological benefit for high dose glucocorticoids, and such studies are unlikely in view of these known adverse effects. The potential for adverse effects at low dose is much less clear. This has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Silva 2006</LINK>) in a paper which includes results reported in RCTs included in this meta-analysis, but also ranges much more widely in the literature seeking evidence applicable to low dose glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis. The conclusions of that review were that published reports on low dose glucocorticoid treatment in rheumatoid arthritis show that few of the commonly held beliefs about their incidence, prevalence, and impact are supported by clear scientific evidence. Safety data from recent randomised controlled clinical trials of low dose glucocorticoid treatment in RA suggest that adverse effects associated with this drug are modest, and often not statistically different from those of placebo. The most immediate concern, reduced bone mineral density, can also now be readily treated. Therefore, we believe the evidence that glucocorticoids given in addition to standard therapy can substantially reduce the rate of erosion progression in rheumatoid arthritis is convincing, and that the use of such treatment should be made readily available to patients. Nevertheless, there remains concern about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy, such as increased cardiovascular risk, and this issue requires further research.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Even in the most conservative estimate, the evidence that glucocorticoids given in addition to standard therapy can significantly reduce the rate of erosion progression in rheumatoid arthritis is convincing. There remains concern about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy.</P>
<P>This review suggests that in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of less than two years duration who require treatment with DMARDs there would be a substantial reduction in joint destruction by the addition of a suitable low dose or step down glucocorticoid regimen. It seems likely that patients with a disease duration of 3 or 4 years would also benefit, but it would be inappropriate to extrapolate into longer disease durations without more firm evidence of benefit.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The cost-effectiveness and relative risk-benefit ratios of new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (such as biological therapies) that (delete: might) reduce radiographic progression can only be established in respect to reduction in radiographic progression if they are compared in head-to-head studies against treatment with DMARDs and glucocorticoids. Concerns about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy require further research.</P>
