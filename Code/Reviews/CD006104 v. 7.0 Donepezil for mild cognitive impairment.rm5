<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Problems with memory which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia, usually called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can be the first sign of an impending dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, but are not necessarily so. Some memory problems are temporary and some do not worsen. Treatment in the very earliest stages of AD may delay progression to AD. Donepezil (Aricept, E2020), a cholinesterase inhibitor, has been shown to benefit all severities of AD including mild and it is reasonable to investigate its efficacy for those with MCI. There is little evidence that donepezil improved cognitive function, and no evidence that donepezil delays progression to AD, but it was associated with significant side effects. There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with MCI. <BR/>

<P>We searched <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A> - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 20 May 2010 using the term: donepezil and in combination with those studies in which the participants had mild cognitive impairment.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-01 14:42:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three included studies, with a total of 782 patients, all with a MMSE greater than 23 points, identified similar patients for inclusion, but were quite different with respect to design and objective. Pooling results in a meta-analysis was not possible.<BR/>In the first study the 13-item ADAS-Cog showed benefit associated with 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.29, p=0.007), but four other measures of cognitive function did not. The analysis of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks, withdrawals due to an adverse event, and numbers experiencing an adverse event, showed a significant difference between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of placebo, (43/133 donepezil 23/137 placebo, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.22, p=0.003), (29/133 donepezil 10/137 placebo, OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.65 to 7.60, p=0.001), (116/133 donepezil, 100/137 placebo, OR 2.52 95% CI 1.34 to 4.76, p=0.004). Various adverse effects were recorded, and several types of event, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, leg cramps and abnormal dreams, were reported more frequently in the donepezil group compared with the placebo.</P>
<P>In the second study there was a significant difference between the number of patients diagnosed with AD or another dementia between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of donepezil after one year of treatment (16/253 donepezil 38/259 placebo) (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72, p=0.003), but no difference after 3 years of treatment (63/253 donepezil 73/259 placebo) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.25, p=0.4).</P>
<P>The third study assessed cognitive function but did not report the results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-01 14:42:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two included studies which reported results for cognitive function. One study demonstrated a modest treatment effect in cognitive function as assessed by ADAS-Cog13 but not for other outcomes assessing different domains of cognitive function. Donepezil was associated with significantly more adverse effects compared with placebo, mostly gastrointestinal. From the second study, there is no evidence that donepezil delays the onset of AD. There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with MCI. The putative benefits are minor, short lived and associated with significant side effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-04 16:47:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Problems with memory and other cognitive abilities but with no diagnosis of dementia, usually called mild cognitive impairment, can be the first sign of an impending dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike AD, there is no consensus on a definition or diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment. Studies have attempted to discover whether decline in any particular domain of cognitive function, such as memory, language, judgement, planning and calculation, is more predictive of AD, and these have lead to identification and description of possible sub-types of MCI, e.g. amnestic MCI.</P>
<P>Other terms commonly in use for the condition lying between normal ageing and dementia include age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), and cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND). Other conditions which have been described include subjective memory complaints (SMC) which does not imply any cognitive deficit at all. The amnestic type of MCI refers to a type that has a primary memory component, either single domain or multiple domain (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2001</LINK>). Amnestic MCI is characterised by impairment of episodic memory (word recall, face recognition), but little or no impairment of activities of daily living (ADL). These people do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia or AD. Despite these attempts to define mild cognitive impairment more rigorously and to identify more accurately the early stages of AD, MCI remains a vague term and those so described are a heterogeneous population, consisting of people who may rapidly progress to meeting a definition but also people with stable cognitive deficits, for example due to stroke, and some who may actually improve (<LINK REF="REF-Bruscoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruscoli 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is considered important that those in the very earliest stages of AD are identified because it is hoped that treatments may one day be shown to delay progression to AD. Interventions that show efficacy in AD have been proposed as possible treatments for people with a memory problem, and it is therefore axiomatic that the cholinesterase inhibitors would be amongst the first treatments to be examined for MCI. </P>
<P>Compounds that can inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine are known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, and abnormalities in cholinergic neurons (including cell loss) are prominent among the pathological changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. One approach to lessening the impact of these abnormalities is to inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The first cholinesterase inhibitors were associated with severe gastrointestinal side effects. Donepezil (Aricept, E2020) is a second generation cholinesterase inhibitor and appears to have fewer side effects than earlier drugs of its class. It has been shown to benefit all severities of AD including mild (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2006-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2006 b</LINK>) and it would be reasonable to investigate its efficacy for those with MCI. </P>

<P>The latest search (May 2010) retrieved a total of 420 results. After a first-assess and a de-duplication of these results the authors were left with 19 references to further assess.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers (JSB and LF) discarded irrelevant publications, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that an article could be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment.</P>
<P>The same reviewers (JSB and LF) independently reviewed the trials for inclusion from the culled citation list. </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB).</P>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of people in each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available. </P>
<P>For binary data the number in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. </P>
<P>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months before. </P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every person assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the person was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial were sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>Data from 'open-label' follow-on phases after the randomized study were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomized, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The outcomes measured in trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were be treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) are required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. For cross-over trials only the data from the first treatment period are used.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time will be assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome is the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardized mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation when they used different rating scales or tests. </P>
<P>The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the range is considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis the data are divided into smaller time periods and a separate meta-analysis conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been made.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as improvement or no improvement, the odds ratio is used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials is calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic is performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two included studies were identified, <LINK REF="STD-_x0034_01" TYPE="STUDY">401</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK>. Both studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil on cognitive impairment in people with an amnestic form of MCI, which represented a change from previous functioning, and who did not have Alzheimer's Disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>). They were screened to eliminate those with symptoms of depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale &gt;12) , and those with a modified Hachinski greater than 4. <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-_x0034_01" TYPE="STUDY">401</LINK>, a multi-centre study comparing donepezil with placebo, included patients with an MMSE greater than 23, a CDR of 0.5, and normal activities of daily living. Those randomized to donepezil received 5 mg/day for 42 days, before the dose was increased to 10 mg/day for the remainder of the 24 weeks study. Failure to tolerate the higher dose led to discontinuation from the study. The study was supported by Eisai Inc. and Pfizer Inc.. </P>
<P>Outcomes were assessed using the following tests and scales. <BR/>1. New York University (NYU) Paragraph Test Delayed Recall (<LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1999</LINK>) <BR/>2. AD Cooperative Study's Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS CGIC) (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1997</LINK>) <BR/>The ADCS-CGIC provides a global rating of patient function in four areas, general, cognitive, behaviour and activities of daily living. All patients are scored on global severity at baseline and subsequent assessments on a scale of 1-7 are relative to baseline, with 1 showing marked improvement, 7 marked worsening with 4 representing no change. Information is obtained from the caregiver and patient and the clinician is blind to all other measures. <BR/>3. CGIC-MCI is adapted from the ADCS-CGIC for use with people with MCI based on semi-structured interview with both subject and an informant. It is scored in a similar way to the ADCS-CGIC. <BR/>4. Modified 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Mohs-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohs 1997</LINK>). The original ADAS-Cog comprises 11 individual tests, spoken language ability (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5), recall of test instructions (0-5), word finding difficulty (0-5), following commands (0-5), naming object (0-5), construction drawing (0-5), ideational praxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), word recall (0-10) and word recognition (0-12). The total score ranges from 0-70, the high score indicating greater impairment. The modified version includes the use of 12 words in a Word Recall test rather than 10 words, the addition of Delayed Word Recall, the reduction in number of trials of the Word Recognition Task from 3 to 1 and the addition of a concentration/distractibility item. <BR/>5. The WMS-R (Wechsler) Digit Span Backwards test (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 1995</LINK>) <BR/>6.

Neuropsychologic test battery including the Boston Naming Task, the Verbal Fluency Test, the Maze Test, and the Number Cancellation test. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK> included patients with a CDR of 0.5, a MMSE greater than 23, and a Logical Memory Delayed Recall score of approximately 1.5 to 2 standard deviations below an education adjusted norm. The study was supported by Eisai Inc. and Pfizer Inc. and the National Institute of Aging. There were three arms to the study, placebo, vitamin E and donepezil. The initial dose of donepezil was 5 mg/day, which was increased to 10 mg/day after 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the time to development of possible or probably Alzheimer's disease, diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. On verification the participant left the trial and was offered open-label donepezil until the end of the 3 year study. The funding for the study was provided equally by the National Institute on Aging and by Pfizer and Eisai.<BR/>Secondary outcomes were assessed using the following tests and scales. </P>
<P>1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) evaluates cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall, and language. The test takes only 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal). <BR/>2. ADAS-Cog 13-item modified as above. <BR/>3. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1988</LINK>) is usually reported as a score, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 but these scores are derived from ratings in six domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care), each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe dementia) and the sum of the ratings (0-18) provides the CDR-SB (sum of boxes) <BR/>4.

The interpretation of these results is complicated by the loss of patients from the trial to open label donepezil when diagnosed with AD or another cause of dementia.</P>
<P>Update 2009</P>
<P>One new study was included. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK> randomized 15 older adults with mild cognitive deficits as demonstrated on at least one scale (Mattis DRS, WAIS and the Brief Visuospatial test) to placebo or donepezil titrated to 10mg/day over 6 weeks. The 6 month trial was double blinded. The outcomes were the MMSE and the Hopkins verbal learning test revised (HVLT-R). Cerebral blood flow was assessed during verbal recall tasks using PET imaging.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-07-01 14:44:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two included studies, with a total of 782 patients, identified similar patients for inclusion. The subjects had a mean age in their early 70s for both included studies. Their mean MMSE score were similar (27.3) and those with measurable depression had been excluded. The two studies were quite different with respect to design and objective. Pooling results in a meta-analysis was not possible. The results for the individual studies are reported.</P>
<P>Update 2009</P>
<P>The new study was a small pilot study. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK> did not report the results of the cognitive tests. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-_x0034_01" TYPE="STUDY">401</LINK>
<BR/>Several tests were used to assess cognitive function. The 13-item ADAS-Cog showed benefit associated with 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks as shown by the ITT-LOC analysis (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.29, p=0.007). There were no significant treatment effects for donepezil compared with placebo for other measures of cognitive function (NYU Paragraph Test Delayed Recall, NYU Paragraph Test Immediate Recall, Wechsler Digit Span Backwards, and Symbol Digit Modalities).</P>
<P>The analysis of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks showed a significant difference in withdrawals between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of placebo.<BR/>(43/133 donepezil 23/137 placebo) (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.22, p=0.003).</P>
<P>The meta-analyses of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks due to an adverse event show that there was a significant difference between the donepezil group compared with the placebo group, in favour of placebo, (29/133 donepezil 10/137 placebo).</P>
<P>Various adverse effects were recorded, and several types of event show a significant difference in favour of placebo for the number of people experiencing such an event before the end of treatment at 24 weeks:<BR/>any adverse events (116/133 donepezil, 100/137 placebo, OR 2.52 95% CI 1.34 to 4.76, p=0.004)<BR/>diarrhoea (36/133 donepezil, 10/137 placebo, OR 4.71 95% CI 2.23 to 9.97, p&lt;0.0001)<BR/>nausea (20/133 donepezil, 9/137 placebo, OR 2.52 95% CI 1.10 to 5.75, p=0.03)<BR/>vomiting (12/133 donepezil, 0/137 placebo, POR 8.30 95% CI 2.61 to 26.37, p=0.0003)<BR/>leg cramps (12/133 donepezil, 2/137 placebo, POR 4.63 95% CI 1.58 to 13.55, p=0.005)<BR/>abnormal dreams (30/133 donepezil, 5/137 placebo, POR 5.31 95% CI 2.61 to 10.79, p&lt;0.00001).</P>

<BR/>Although the results for cognition, activities of daily living, and global status at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months were reported they are not included in this review. The numbers of people included at each assessment time point were not reported. This is essential information, interpretation of the results is impossible without these numbers. People left the trial on being diagnosed with AD and therefore all results will be biased if there is differential dropout from the groups. The only results considered reliable are those for the numbers diagnosed with AD at 12 and 36 months.</P>
<P>The analysis of the number of patients diagnosed with AD or another dementia after 1 year of treatment showed a significant difference between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of donepezil (16/253 donepezil 38/259 placebo) (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72, p=0.003). This difference was not significant after 3 years of treatment (63/253 donepezil 73/259 placebo) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.25, p=0.4).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although these studies have described their subjects relatively completely, the inclusion criteria remain an issue, when there is no consensus as to how the diagnosis of MCI is operationalised. For example in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK>, the memory complaint had to be corroborated by an informant and effectively removed those subjects who may have satisfied the cognitive criteria with subjective memory complaints. In both studies years of education criteria were used to adjust memory test cut-offs. In both studies subjects may not have fulfilled "dementia" criteria by NINCDS-ADRDA, (normally criteria to distinguish AD from other forms of dementia) but were still able to score a box label of 1 on the CDR for non-memory functions. Clearly the demarcation of some of these subjects from very early AD is challenging. </P>
<P>The subjects had a mean age in their early 70s for both included studies. Their mean MMSE score were similar (27.3 for <LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK>, and 27.4 for <LINK REF="STD-_x0034_01" TYPE="STUDY">401</LINK>) and the subjects in the <LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK> study appeared to be living relatively independently (mean GDS 2.7, ADL scores of 46). Although APOE E4 carrier status was analysed (<LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK>) to determine whether there was effect modification, it may have been useful to determine if the effect seen in the initial 12 months was only seen in the functionally disabled group, some of whom may have preferentially discontinued in the donepezil group. The authors suggest that of those with the E4 allele, those on donepezil progress less rapidly to diagnosis of dementia than those on placebo. If overall there is no effect does this mean that those without the E4 allele progress more rapidly when on donepezil? The authors do not present sufficient data for this possible result to be examined. The better analysis would have investigated the possible interaction between APOE status and treatment and this does not appear to have been done. <BR/> <BR/>Although there may have been some minor differences noted in the first 12 months if we are to ascribe such differences to an effect of donepezil in delaying AD for 12 months we must also accept that it then accelerates the appearance of AD after 18 months.</P>
<P>Overall these studies have a fairly high rate of conversion to AD over 3 years which may reflect the recruitment of subjects from clinic type populations and the need of corroboration of the memory complaint from an informant.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-01 14:46:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with MCI. The putative benefits are minor, short lived and associated with significant side effects.</P>
<P>One of the three included studies, <LINK REF="STD-_x0034_01" TYPE="STUDY">401</LINK> demonstrated a modest treatment effect in cognitive function, -1.9 points as assessed by ADAS-Cog13. ADAS-Cog13 has a range of 0-85. The treatment effect adjusted to be comparable to ADAS-Cog (0-70) is -1.6 points. This is lower than that average treatment effect (-2.8 points) seen in the trials of the donepezil for mild to moderate patients with AD. We may be seeing a smaller treatment effect because a smaller percentage are benefiting, perhaps only those who go on to be diagnosed with AD in the next few years (<LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK> 27% were diagnosed within three years). The problem still remains that it is not possible to identify those who will benefit (and that benefit is only a slight improvement in cognitive function, not a delay in progression to AD), and treating a wider population leads to a large percentage not experiencing benefit, but possible side effects. We must also remember that other outcomes assessing different domains of cognitive function showed no significant treatment effect.</P>
<P>Those taking donepezil suffered significantly more adverse effects, mostly the gastrointestinal adverse effects, which became apparent when the dose was increased from 5 mg to 10 mg/day. There was no estimate of the numbers developing dementia. From the second of the three included trials, <LINK REF="STD-Thal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thal 1999</LINK>, there is no evidence that donepezil delays the onset of AD. There is no evidence that there is any overall advantage for those displaying the symptoms of MCI to be prescribed donepezil but considerable disadvantage in the form of adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Two studies with 782 participants have demonstrated that it is not beneficial for those with MCI to be prescribed donepezil. Many are suffering side effects unnecessarily. The evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors for MCI is not an area of research which should be given high priority.<BR/>
