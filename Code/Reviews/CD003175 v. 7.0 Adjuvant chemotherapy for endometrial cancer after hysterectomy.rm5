<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-01 18:46:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Womb (uterine/endometrial) cancer is a fairly common disease affecting approximately 1 in 70 women. A hysterectomy is usually curative because most cancers have a low risk of spreading (metastasising) to other sites which may result in a later recurrence. Microscopic examination of the hysterectomy specimen can tell doctors if there is a high risk of the cancer returning and this allows women to decide if they want further preventative treatment (adjuvant therapy) to reduce the risk. Chemotherapy can increase cure rates for other types of high-risk cancer after initial surgery and this review examines the effectiveness of chemotherapy for primary womb cancer after hysterectomy. Data from nine high quality randomised clinical trials involving up to 2197 women were subjected to systematic statistical modelling. This shows that chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent disease, lengthens the duration women have before a metastasis is diagnosed and improves survival rates. There are many ways to examine the data. The subset analysis that excluded old fashioned drug regimens suggests that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any nominated time by a quarter. The number of women who would need to have need chemotherapy to prevent one death depends on the type of cancer. In these trials, one woman was cured for every 25 women treated with high dose platinum based chemotherapy after hysterectomy. This is an absolute risk reduction of 4%. Chemotherapy is associated with a greater survival advantage than radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy. It also appears to reduce the absolute risk of developing a recurrence outside the pelvis by about 5%. This would benefit one woman in every 20 treated. However, chemotherapy has side effects, risks and temporarily reduces a woman's quality of life. In many cases, the small reduction in the cancer recurrence risk may not be worth the side effects of adjuvant treatment.</P>

<P>Five RCTs compared no additional treatment with additional chemotherapy after hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy. Indiscriminate pooling of survival data from 2197 women shows a significant overall survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy (RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99)). Sensitivity analysis focused on trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy regimens and found the relative risk of death to be 0.85 ((0.76 to 0.96); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) = 25; absolute risk reduction = 4% (1% to 8%)). The HR for overall survival is 0.74 (0.64 to 0.89), significantly favouring the addition of postoperative platinum based chemotherapy. The HR for progression-free survival is 0.75 (0.64 to 0.89). This means that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any censorship by a quarter. Chemotherapy reduces the risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis (RR = 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92), 5% absolute risk reduction; NNT = 20). The analysis of pelvic recurrence rates is underpowered but the trend suggests that chemotherapy may be less effective than radiotherapy in a direct comparison (RR = 1.28 (0.97 to 1.68)) but it may have added value when used with radiotherapy (RR = 0.48 (0.20 to 1.18)).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-31 15:12:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 15:12:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Endometrial cancer is also known as adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, uterine cancer or womb cancer. This is a malignant growth of the lining (endometrium) of the womb (uterus) classified by the <LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization</LINK> as C54. It is distinct from sarcomas (tumours of the uterine muscle). It is the seventh commonest cancer in women worldwide with approximately 290,000 cases annually and about 75,000 related deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2010</LINK>). It affects at least 1.5% of western women in their lifetime. The chance of surviving uterine cancer depends on the stage of the cancer when it is first diagnosed.</P>
<P>Endometrial cancer is classified into stages according to the microscopic pattern and its ability to invade into the uterine muscle. This also determines the risk of recurrence and treatment options. The common pathological type is an endometrioid adenocarcinoma but about 10% of endometrial cancers have a serous or clear cell appearance. A small percentage are the mixed mesenchymal mullerian malignant tumour (MMMT), also known as carcinosarcoma. Mixed mesenchymal malignant tumours were initially thought to be a mixed tumour involving sarcoma and epithelial malignancy but modern pathology now recognises that they are derived from a monoclonal epithelial cell that undergoes multilineage differentiation to include sarcomatous metaplasia. All these tumours behave differently from endometrioid cancers and have a relatively poor prognosis. The stage of the cancer is based on conventional pathology examination of the resected surgical specimen. The International Federation of Gynecological Oncology (FIGO) stage system was the UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) TNM system 6 (sixth edition) until 31 December 2009. From 1 January 2010 this was superseded by TNM system 7 (seventh edition, <LINK REF="REF-Sobin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobin 2009</LINK>). The differences are highlighted in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. A cancer that has a low risk of recurring is a well-differentiated (Grade 1 or G1) pure endometrioid tumour that has not invaded into the uterine muscle (previously classified as FIGO stage 1a) or has only invaded up to half way (previously classified as FIGO stage 1b but since 2009 classified as stage 1a). These tumours are usually cured by hysterectomy only. Intermediate risk cancer is conventionally defined as a tumour confined to the body of the uterus but is either poorly differentiated (Grade 3 or G3) and early, invading less than 50% of the way through the uterine muscle or well/moderately differentiated (grade 1/2 or G2) with invasion more than 50% of the way through the uterus (formally classified at stage 1c, now stage 1b) and when there are no other risk factors. A small number of these tumours will recur. High-risk cancers have a higher risk of recurrence and adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent disease in the pelvis (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2007</LINK>). There is no universally accepted definition of "high risk" but the risk factors include spread beyond the body of the uterus, deep invasion through the muscle, poorly differentiated or non endometrioid type, tumour seen in the vessels of the uterus (lymphvascular invasion) and advanced age.</P>
<P>It follows that the risk of micro-metastases outside the uterus after surgery determines the role of further (adjuvant) therapy. This risk can be predicted from look up tables (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>) or nomograms (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2010</LINK>). Virtually all low risk tumours are cured by surgery alone and additional treatment will result in unnecessary toxicity. Some women with intermediate risk tumours may benefit from adjuvant treatment reducing the risk of relapse but the gain might be offset by the side effects. A substantial proportion of women with high risk cancers harbour micro-metastases after surgery. More women from this group will gain from adjuvant therapy. These women will have to decide if the reduction in micro-metastatic disease and the subsequent reduction in the risk of subsequent tumour progression or death is enough for them to tolerate the risks and side effects of additional treatment.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-01 09:52:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adjuvant therapy refers to the treatment offered after surgical removal of the tumour. Adjuvant therapy can be chemotherapy, endocrine/hormonal or radiotherapy. The aim of adjuvant treatment is to destroy any cancer cells that might have spread beyond the uterus before the hysterectomy. In this analysis, we study the impact of adding chemotherapy after hysterectomy, whether this is as an additional treatment or a replacement for radiotherapy. This analysis focuses on endometrial cancer, a malignant disease of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and this does not apply to sarcomas. The data applies to women who have had hysterectomy with curative intent and reflects a range of surgical approaches, stages and grade of disease. The benefits and harms of lymph node surgery, adjuvant endocrine (hormonal) therapy and radiotherapy are reviewed in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> by <LINK REF="REF-May-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Hirsch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Hirsch 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Kong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2007</LINK> respectively.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-01 12:50:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several reasons why adjuvant chemotherapy has the potential to improve cure rates.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly, multiple case series have shown that advanced and recurrent uterine cancer is sensitive to chemotherapy. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 11 eligible trials involving 2288 patients with advanced endometrial cancer showed that more compared to less chemotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.80, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.90, P = 0.004) (<LINK REF="REF-Humber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humber 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The second reason for thinking it might work is that adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival after excisional surgery from other glandular cancers such as breast (<LINK REF="REF-Gelber-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Nes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nes 2005</LINK>), colorectal (<LINK REF="REF-Figueredo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueredo 2008</LINK>) and lung adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The third justification for adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk but apparently completely removed endometrial cancer is the discovery that adjuvant chemotherapy increases the cure rate from ovarian cancer under the same circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2009</LINK>). The same might apply to uterine cancer.</LI>
<LI>A fourth reason for promoting postoperative chemotherapy for endometrial cancer is that it probably has activity in related tumours of the uterus. Both mixed mullerian malignant tumours of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Galaal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galaal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2008</LINK>) and uterine sarcomas (<LINK REF="REF-Piver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piver 2006</LINK>) respond to chemotherapy.</LI>
<LI>The fifth reason in support is that dose-dense cytotoxic chemotherapy has activity in cervical cancers and the cervix is part of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2004</LINK>) and chemotherapy improves survival rates if it is added to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Finally, adjuvant pelvic external beam radiotherapy as a cytoxic regimen reduces the risk of pelvic recurrence by a factor of 4.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2007</LINK>). This implies that the natural behaviour of endometrial cancer can be altered by cytotoxic treatment.</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 13:18:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Postoperative chemotherapy for endometrial cancer is worthy of study because endometrial cancer is common, chemotherapy is an expensive and toxic treatment and any potential prolongation of survival needs to be balanced against the associated toxicity.</P>
<P>Radiotherapy may eliminate residual postoperative small volume metastatic deposits in the field that is treated. However, it will not eliminate potential recurrence from micro-metastasis outside the field of radiotherapy. Women who have an especially high risk of recurrent disease predicted from the hysterectomy laboratory analysis might have an increased survival if microscopic distant metastases beyond the field of radiotherapy were destroyed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy has the potential to destroy micro metastases and reduce the risk of recurrence and increase survival. This review assesses the possible effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy after hysterectomy for women with endometrial cancer.</P>

<P>The collaborative Nordic (<LINK REF="STD-NSGO" TYPE="STUDY">NSGO</LINK>) and European trials (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55991" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55991</LINK>) ran in parallel using the same protocol. The Nordic Gynaecology Oncology Group and the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer studied the effect of randomly allocating a platinum based chemotherapy regimen against no additional treatment. The trial participants all had a hysterectomy and radiotherapy for endometrial cancer. Initially, the trial was exclusively studying cancers confined to the corpus but a later amendment allowed stage 2 and 3 to be included. The exact choice of chemotherapy regimen varied over the recruitment period of the trial but all were derived from standard active published regimens used in trials of chemotherapy in advanced disease. Before August 2004, chemotherapy consisted of four courses of cisplatin 50 mg/m² + doxorubicin 50 mg/m² or epirubicin 75 mg/m². Thereafter several chemotherapy regimens were allowed, of which cisplatin 50 mg/m² + doxorubicin 50 mg/m², paclitaxel 175 mg/m² + epirubicin 60 mg/m² + carboplatin AUC 5, and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² + carboplatin AUC 5-6 were used. The pivotal presentation at the 2007 ASCO meeting describes 382 women. Data are now available from 383 women, 320 from NSGO and 63 from the EORTC. The EORTC have not yet published independent data but early published results are available from ESMO and ASCO presentations and the collaborative data on 534 evaluable women including data from <LINK REF="STD-MaNGO" TYPE="STUDY">MaNGO</LINK> was published in 2010 (NSGO, MaNGO and EORTC). Risk factors were well balanced between the randomisation arms. The primary outcome endpoint was progression-free survival defined as the time from randomisation to progression of endometrial cancer or death from all causes. Secondary end-points included overall survival.</P>

It is similar to the Nordic (<LINK REF="STD-NSGO" TYPE="STUDY">NSGO</LINK>) and European trial (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55991" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55991</LINK>) but recruited a larger proportion of more advanced stage cases.

<LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK> was a multi institution national randomised trial from Finland examining the effect of adding platinum-based chemotherapy or not in 156 women with high-risk endometrial cancer after standard surgery and radiotherapy. The objective was to measure the overall and disease-free survival and recurrence rates in women with intermediate or high-risk endometrial cancer. The women had Stage Ia or 1b Grade 3 (n = 28), or Stage pT1c-pT3a grade 1-3 (n = 128) (using the UICC TNM 6<SUP>th</SUP> edition staging prior to 2009-<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). They were randomised postoperatively to receive radiotherapy (56 Gray) only ("Group A", n = 72) or radiotherapy in a sandwich regimen combined with three courses of cisplatin (50 mg/m²), epirubicin (60 mg/m²) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m²) ("Group B", n = 84). The radiotherapy was given in two courses of 28 Gray each, separated by a pause of three weeks. The chemotherapy was given in three courses. The first was given after surgery and before radiotherapy. The second was given in the pause in radiotherapy and the final course was given within 2 weeks of completing the final radiation treatment. The authors reported disease-specific overall five-year survival and median disease-free survival and time from surgery to recurrence.</P>

<P>The Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 34 examined the addition of doxorubicin (Adriamycin<SUP>®</SUP>) versus no additional treatment after surgery plus external beam radiation therapy. This randomised, prospective trial studied women with clinical stage pT1 or pT2 (occult) endometrial cancer who, after surgical-pathologic evaluation, had one or more risk factors for recurrence: greater than 50% myometrial invasion, pelvic or aortic node metastasis, cervical involvement, or adnexal metastases. All women without aortic node metastasis received 50 Gray to the whole pelvis at 1.6 to 1.8 Gray per day. If aortic node metastasis was documented, additional para-aortic field radiation extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interspace was offered. The aortic target dose was 45 Gray at 1.5 Gray per day. After completion of radiation therapy, women were randomised to receive doxorubicin bolus therapy (60 mg/m² starting dose) to a maximum cumulative dose of 500 mg/m². Ninety-two women were entered into the doxorubicin treatment arm, and 89 patients entered the arm with no additional treatment.</P>

</P>
<P>The Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 122 compared whole-abdominal irradiation (WAI) with chemotherapy in 422 women with UICC 6th edition stage pT3 or pT4a endometrial carcinoma having a maximum of 2 cm of postoperative residual disease after surgery. Three hundred and ninety-six women were assessable. A total of 202 were randomly allocated to receive WAI, and 194 were allocated to receive chemotherapy. Radiotherapy involved 30 Gray at 1.5 Gray per day to the whole abdomen with a 15 Gray boost to the pelvis. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg/m² and cisplatin 50 mg/m² every three weeks for seven cycles, followed by one additional cycle of cisplatin designed to restrict the possible cumulative cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin. Most patient and tumour characteristics were well balanced. The median age was 63 years; 50% had endometrioid tumours. Median follow-up time was 74 months. However, GOG 122 was not a purely adjuvant trial because the recruitment criteria included residual tumour up to 2 cm and the radiotherapy dose was insufficient to treat residual tumour of this size. In contrast, the chemotherapy was extensive and toxic (8 cycles). The trial reported a crude hazard ratio and a hazard ratio adjusted for stage for overall survival and disease-free survival.</P>

<P>This Italian trial randomly assigned adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy after hysterectomy to 345 women with high-risk endometrial carcinoma (UICC 6th edition stage pT1cG3, pT2G3 with myometrial invasion greater than 50%, and pT3). Chemotherapy involved 5 cycles of cisplatin (50 mg/m²), doxorubicin (45 mg/m²) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) every 28 days. Radiotherapy involved 50 Gray external beam to the pelvis on a 5 days week schedule in 45 fractions. Median follow-up at the time of reporting was 8.0 years. The primary end points were overall and progression-free survival.

<P>This Japanese multi-centre randomised trial compared adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy with a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin-®), cisplatin (CAP) chemotherapy. 103 institutions randomised 385 women with UICC 6th edition stage pT1c-pT3c and &gt; 50% myometrial invasion (stage pT2 or pT3 with &lt; 50% invasion were ineligible). Stage distribution was pT1c 61%, pT2 14%, pT3a 13%, pT3c12%. Women were randomly allocated pelvic radiotherapy (n = 193) or CAP chemotherapy (n = 192). External beam radiotherapy delivered 45 to 50 Gray via anterior-posterior opposed beams. The CAP chemotherapy regimen involved cyclophosphamide (333 mg/m²), doxorubicin (40 mg/m²) and cisplatin (50 mg/m²) every four weeks for three or more courses. The trial reported overall and progression-free survival, as well as the five-year overall and progression-free survival rates. These rates were further analysed in low- to intermediate-risk groups (defined as stage pTIc in women under 70 years old with grade1 or 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma) and high- to intermediate-risk cancer (defined as invasion of tumour to the outer half of the myometrium in women over 70 years of age) or G3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma or tumour involving any part of the cervix or positive cytology (TNM 6th edition pT1c and &gt; 70years, pT1cG3, pT2, pT3a).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK> trial focused on women with mixed mullerian mesenchymal malignant tumours (also called carcinosarcoma). Many experts believe these tumours originate from endometrial cancer cell lines but this view was not universally held in the past. Consequently, the meta-analysis studying the impact of chemotherapy for women with endometrial cancer is presented including these data for those who believe this tumour is a cancer and it is presented excluding this data for those readers who prefer to consider the tumour as a separate entity. The trial compared chemotherapy (n = 101) with whole body radiation (n = 105) in women presenting for the first time with any stage of primary mixed mullerian mesenchymal malignant tumour of the uterus or cervix without demonstrable parenchymal hepatic involvement or extra-abdominal distant disease. Surgical staging revealed that 44% of women had disease beyond the uterus and cervix (stage III-IV). The chemotherapy comprised intravenous cisplatin (20 mg/m²/day × 4 days) followed by a one hour IV administration of Ifosfamide (1.5 g/m²/day IV × 4 days) with mesna (120 mg/m² IV bolus over 15 minutes on day one, followed by 1.5 g/m²/day IV continuous infusion × 4 days beginning with day one) every three weeks for three cycles. Radiotherapy initially involved hyperfractionation doses but this was changed to daily doses due to poor accrual. The abdomen received 30 Gray, the pelvis received approximately 50 Gray.</P>
<P>The authors reported the estimated overall survival and the crude probability of disease recurring within 5 years and the adjusted rate accounting for stage and age.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall effect of chemotherapy on survival rates</HEADING>
<P>Chemotherapy is associated with an improved survival and a longer disease free survival. The hazard ratio compares survival curves and represents the risk of death over time if chemotherapy is added to the treatment regimen, either as an addition to surgery and radiotherapy or instead of radiotherapy. The hazard ratio (HR) of death from any cause is 0.74 (0.62 to 0.89). This represents a significant overall survival advantage for women in these trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There is a similar progression-free survival advantage (HR = 0.75 (0.62 to 0.89)) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The probability that this is a chance finding is less than one in a thousand (P = 0.0009). The data are not affected by any significant variability or distortion due to heterogeneity (I² = 0%).</P>
<P>Nine trials allow a comparison of death rates for chemotherapy versus any other arm. Survival data 5 years after randomisation from 2197 women gave a relative risk of 0.88 (95% CI; 0.79 to 0.99) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). This indiscriminate analysis represents an odds ratio of 83% and a risk difference of 3% (95% CI;0.01 to 0.07) This represents an absolute change in risk attributable to chemotherapy for one women in every 33 who are treated; NNT = 33; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-GICOG" TYPE="STUDY">GICOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK>) compared chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy after surgery. The pooled data meta-analyses show a statistically significant improvement in survival rates (risk ratio (95% CI) = 0.76. (0.62 to 0.92)) when chemotherapy is compared with radiotherapy (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). There is a similar advantage in progression-free survival (HR = 0.80; 0.66 to 0.97). Data from four trials involving 1326 women show a risk ratio (relative risk of death at five years) of 0.87 (0.76 to 0.99), <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>. The absolute risk reduction in death attributable to the chemotherapy is 4%. Twentyfive women would need to be treated to treat to save one life. The hazard ratio remains the same (0.76 (0.61 to 0.96); n = 1120) if the analysis excludes trials focusing on mixed tumours with potentially different biology (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> was not a pure adjuvant trial because it included residual tumour up to 2cm and the radiotherapy may not have been adequate for this volume of disease. The statistical significance is lost if this trial is omitted from this analysis (overall survival advantage HR= 0.86 [0.65, 1.14]). Nevertheless, the percentage of the variability in effect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than chance is negligible (I² = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparing the addition of chemotherapy versus no treatment after surgery and radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the impact on survival from adding chemotherapy versus no additional treatment by pooling <LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MaNGO" TYPE="STUDY">MaNGO</LINK> and NSGO &amp; EORTC (<LINK REF="STD-Hogberg" TYPE="STUDY">Hogberg</LINK>). In these trials, all women had surgery plus pelvic radiotherapy. This analysis reveals a similar effect but the analysis lacks power due to the smaller sample size (n = 871) and there is significant variation in the summary findings implying that the trials are heterogenous (I² = 32%). This means that the trials may not be studying the same intervention and it may be mathematically inappropriate to combine them. <LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK> studied a chemotherapy regimen that would not be used today whilst <LINK REF="STD-MaNGO" TYPE="STUDY">MaNGO</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55991" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NSGO" TYPE="STUDY">NSGO</LINK> studied conventional platinum based regimens. Therefore, a case can be made for separating these trials. If NSGO, MaNGO and EORTC only are analysed, the overall survival and progression-free advantage HR from receiving chemotherapy is 0.68 (0.45 to 1.02; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) and 0.63 (0.44 to 0.89; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>) respectively. The risk of death at five years is may be reduced by chemotherapy RR = 0.74 (0.51 to 1.06), risk difference 6% (-1% to 12%). However, inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK> data (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) caused the data to be heterogeneous (I² = 10%) and the analysis cannot detect any difference in the risk of death at five years (RR = 0.94 (0.72 to 1.22)).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Senstivity analysis; excluding mixed mesenchymal tumours</HEADING>
<P>Mixed mesenchymal tumours may have different biology but excluding the data from these tumours (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK>) does not significantly affect the summary statistics. The hazard ratio for overall survival and progression-free survival is the same irrespective of whether the data from mixed mesenchymal tumours are included or excluded (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The risk ratio also remains at 0.89 (0.78 to 1.02) if women with mixed tumours (carcinosarcomas) are excluded (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; n = 1991) and 0.85 (0.74, 0.98) if women with mixed tumours and trials of unconventional chemotherapy are excluded. Again, there is no significant variability in estimates due to heterogeneity (I² = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Senstivity analysis; using adjusted or unadjusted hazard ratios</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> study reported a hazard ratio adjusted for stage. Other trials report the unadjusted statistic. Sensitivity analysis shows that this is unimportant as the combined hazard ratio for both overall survival and progression-free interval is similar whether the adjusted or the unadjusted hazard ratio is used. The unadjusted hazard ratio recalculated from the survival curves of <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> yields a summary statistic (combined Hazard ratio for overall survival 0.77 (0.65 to 0.92) compared to 0.74 (0.62 to 0.89) if the adjusted figure is used.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Senstivity analysis; excluding unconventional chemotherapy regimen such as doxorubicin monotherapy or split course regimens</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hogberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogberg 2008</LINK>'s primary hypothesis was that chemotherapy has limited value unless it is given with radical adjuvant intent. This would exclude <LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK> because it is a trial sandwiching chemotherapy in between radiotherapy and could be considered to be a trial of radiation sensitiser, rather than a trial of adjuvant chemotherapy. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK> only used single agent doxorubicin and no platinum agent. Studies of chemotherapy in advanced disease suggest a significantly higher activity with multi-agent regimens. <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK> excludes these two trials and shows that the relative risk of death during the trial period is 0.85 (0.76 to 0.96; n = 1860). This is consistent with a significant survival advantage to chemotherapy (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). This equates to an absolute risk reduction of 4% (95% CI; 1% to 8%). If these data were replicated in practice, 25 women would need to receive modern chemotherapy for one to avoid death (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). There is minimal variability in effect estimates due to heterogeneity (I² = 0%) despite the fact that this combines data from trials in which chemotherapy is added to surgery or is an alternative to radiotherapy.</P>
<P>Restricting the analysis to only include trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy regimens is associated with funnel plots that demonstrate greater homogeneity. This means that there is minimal risk of contamination by heterogeneity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of extra-pelvic recurrence</HEADING>
<P>All included trials reported the risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis. Data are available on 2198 women (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). The risk ratio is 0.79 (95% CI; 0.68 to 0.92) implying that chemotherapy reduces the chance that the first site of recurrence will be outside the pelvis (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). This translates to a 22% relative risk reduction, 5% absolute risk reduction (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). The number needed to treat to prevent one recurrence is 20. The variability in effect estimates attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance is negligible (I² = 0%) and the result is similar if the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK> carcinosarcoma trial is excluded (<LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>).</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK> does not report data on the risk of pelvic recurrence but we know that there is no significant difference in rates. That leaves data from 690 women to analyse. Chemotherapy appears to show a trend to lower rates of recurrent disease in the pelvis but this calculation is underpowered due to the small sample size. The difference is not statistically significant (risk ratio (95% CI) = 0.48 (0.20 to 1.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>). However, the only available data from <LINK REF="STD-NSGO" TYPE="STUDY">NSGO</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MaNGO" TYPE="STUDY">MaNGO</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55991" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55991</LINK> have been summated and this crude pooling of data does not lend itself to accurate meta-analysis risk ratio calculations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of pelvic recurrence; chemotherapy versus radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>The Italian <LINK REF="STD-GICOG" TYPE="STUDY">GICOG</LINK>, American <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>, Japanese <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK> carcinosarcoma trial give data on the rate of pelvic relapse comparing radiotherapy to chemotherapy. These four trials report the first site of recurrence for 1327 women. There is a trend towards chemotherapy being associated with more recurrent disease first becoming apparent in the pelvis compared to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). This is not statistically significant; risk ratio (95% CI) = 1.28 (0.97 to 1.68) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). The risk ratio = 1.24 (0.90 to 1.70) if the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK> carcinosarcoma trial is excluded.</P>
<P>Separating the site of recurrence shows that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy have activity. One reason why there may be an increase in the risk of metastasis presenting initially in one site rather than another may not be the failure to control disease. A reduction in the incidence at one site might mean women will live long enough to develop a recurrence elsewhere. What matters to women is the risk of a recurrence at any site. The location of that site then becomes important because salvage therapy depends on the location of the recurrence and the prior treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of any recurrence at any site</HEADING>
<P>Chemotherapy reduces the risk of developing an initial recurrence outside the pelvis (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). It might have added value and reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence when used with radiotherapy (<LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>) but the risk of pelvic recurrence might increase if radiotherapy is omitted (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). The impact of this is shown by studying the risk of any recurrence at any site.</P>
<P>There is no detectable difference between chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the overall risk of a metastasis (RR = 0.95 (0.83 to 1.08)). This is based on four trials studying 1327 women and is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.7</LINK>. However, chemotherapy significantly reduces the risk of a recurrence at any site (risk ratio (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.41 to 0.84) compared to no additional treatment (after surgery and radiotherapy). The combined data from <LINK REF="STD-Hogberg" TYPE="STUDY">Hogberg</LINK> means that <LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK> has 4 data sets. In other words, a woman will have an additional reduction in the risk of a recurrence even if she is having radiotherapy (<LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).</P>

The effect of chemotherapy in this subgroup seems similar to the impact for all cancers. However, the small numbers in this subgroup mean that the analysis lacks power and the beneficial effect cannot be confirmed (Overall survival HR = 0.98 (95% CI; 0.68 to 1.40) and progression-free survival HR = 0.84 (95% CI; 0.57 to 1.23))</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> compared whole-abdominal irradiation with doxorubicin-cisplatin chemotherapy in 422 women. It was the only study to report quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Bruner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruner 2007</LINK>). In this intention-to-treat analysis on 388 eligible patients, no statistical differences in Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scores were identified at any assessment time between the two groups. In terms of fatigue, the only difference between the groups was shown at the end of treatment with women having whole abdominal radiotherapy reporting significantly higher fatigue compared to women on chemotherapy (P &lt; .01). Fatigue and elimination problems were acutely worse for women having radiotherapy but the score levels off at 6 months to close to pre-treatment levels. However, marked peripheral neuropathy was sustained for at least 6 months for women receiving chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Each trial reports some toxicity data and this is listed in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> but this is insufficient to estimate the gains in the form of quality-adjusted benefit. The relationship between chemotherapy treatment toxicity and global quality of life effects is not clear (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luoma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luoma 2002</LINK>) and this has significant implications when deciding the overall gain to patients where the Quality Adjusted Life year is the preferred measure of incremental benefit.</P>
<P>There is insufficient agreement between the reporting of trials to make any meaningful comments about serious adverse events. However, rare serious toxicities associated with chemotherapy are known for many regimens and the risk for each patient needs to be individualised. Data from trials is not the most appropriate tool to assess rare events but the trial data are abstracted in the toxicity section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-01 10:32:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival, progression-free survival and reduces the risk of recurrent metastases. It seems to have a greater effect on survival than radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy.</P>
<P>Radiotherapy is an effective cytotoxic treatment but its benefits are limited to reducing pelvic relapse. In contrast, chemotherapy has a systemic effect and this is probably why it is associated with the additional reduction in the rate of distant extrapelvic metastases. The proportion of women having micro-metastatic disease is greatest in high-risk disease, and the effects of adjuvant therapy are easiest to show in this group. For example, the magnitude of effect was small in the <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK> trial. In the early ASCO presentations of this trial, 208 women had low or intermediate risk disease with an overall relapse rate of 10%. Adjuvant treatment in this subgroup had little demonstrable effect but the 67 women with high-risk disease and a recurrence rate of 25% gained a substantial benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The full report (<LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK>) has slightly different numbers and this is explored in the table of bias. In contrast to the trials studying women with low risk pathology, the magnitude of the effect in <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> was large and this trial had a survival rate below 50%.</P>
<P>The beneficial effect of chemotherapy seems to be limited to postoperative platinum based sequential regimens. Unconventional and non standard regimens such as single agent doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-34" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 34</LINK>) or chemotherapy sandwiched around and interrupting radiotherapy had little impact on survival (<LINK REF="STD-Kuoppala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuoppala 2008</LINK>). It seems that chemotherapy is most effective when using conventional platinum-based regimens.</P>
<P>As global QoL comparisons were only included in one randomised trial, it is difficult to quantify the trade-off between toxicity and benefit from chemotherapy. We know that women with certain stages of ovarian cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer will risk the toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy for absolute benefits in the range of 5% to 10%. This suggests that some women with high-risk endometrial cancer might accept the toxicity of platinum based multi-agent chemotherapy for the likely but small survival gain identified by this meta-analysis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-01 10:33:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contact with trials groups and registries, as well as with reviewers has made publication bias unlikely. We feel that it is very unlikely that the study coordinators or our reviewers have missed a large negative trial with data of sufficient power to reverse our conclusion. Therefore, the evidence in this review is as complete as it can be.</P>
<P>The applicability of this work to practice is more controversial. All this review can say is that adjuvant chemotherapy has activity, reduces the risk of distant metastases and improves survival rates. This finding is clearly relevant to policy makers who should make an economic assessment, evaluate resources and consider making adjuvant chemotherapy available to selected high-risk groups. However, the applicability of the findings of this review to clinical practice is much more difficult to assess. This review does not help the clinician choose who to treat, when to treat or what treatment to use. The only implication of these data is that clinicians should consider platinum based chemotherapy and radiotherapy, assess the prior risk of distant and local metastases, titrate the obvious harms and risks from a chosen chemotherapy regimen and support the patient as she makes a difficult decision about her adjuvant therapy options.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-06-01 10:39:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the first study to be able to include more than 2000 women with endometrial cancer who were randomised between adjuvant treatments with chemotherapy or not. The magnitude of the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy is small, with an absolute difference of only 3% in the overall study. Individual trials were underpowered to confirm this effect. This study also informs prospective trial designs and data monitoring committees of the required sample size to achieve adequate statistical power. Small trials with low event rates will be be underpowered if they are examining a survival advantage.</P>
<P>The strength of this study is that it allows all the data to be analysed together, to produce one result. Many of the individual contributing trials lacked statistical power and performed subgroup analyses and potentially unjustified data adjustments to make claims of benefit (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK>). The claims from individual trials that there was an overall survival benefit with chemotherapy was difficult to accept when there was no improvement in progression-free survival to suggest that more active cancer treatment was the cause. This study overcomes these issues.</P>
<P>While many groups have argued that histological subtypes of endometrial cancers may have different natural histories, other publications show the opposite. In other sub studies based on reanalysis by different groups, stage or pathology type has been used to suggest an effect. This has been used to justify secondary trial data analysis with conclusions unsupported by the total evidence. In contrast, this study has permitted all the different histological types of endometrial cancer to contribute to the data as intended as studies recruited in a primary analysis with a clear conclusion. The absence of heterogeneity from this broader inclusion strategy suggests the results of the study have general applicability.</P>
<P>A weakness of meta-analysis is that sources of bias are not controlled by the method. A good meta-analysis of badly designed studies will still result in bad statistics. Assessment of the risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence in this study is reassuring. The ability to calculate the effect with the unadjusted total data from 8 data sets with more than 2000 trial participants overcomes the well-recognised selective reporting and publication within the individual studies themselves. Further reassurance about data bias is that the search strategy produced only trials monitored by experienced national or supra-national trials groups. Each group has a long record of publication; practises external review and has independent data monitoring. Inhomogeneity in meta-analysis is a frequent driver of bias. The low I² seen in the calculations suggests that this effect will not bias the result. Further strength comes from sensitivity analysis. While individual studies have made sub-studies of the competing effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the sensitivity analysis of this meta-analysis shows the treatment effect is present irrespective of whether chemotherapy was compared with radiotherapy or with no adjuvant treatment.</P>
<P>The weakness of the study is that only one of eight contributing studies reported Quality of Life scores in each arm. This means that while we may be certain that there is a survival benefit from chemotherapy, we are uncertain whether the survival gain is outweighed by toxicity. This means that economic analyses of the cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy will have to be based on &#8220;added life year&#8221; gains (ALY) rather than &#8220;quality-adjusted life year&#8221; gains (QALY).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-06-01 10:42:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed a comprehensive search. Three reviewers (NJ, TM and AB) independently sifted all studies and extracted data. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. This will minimise bias. The greatest threat to the validity of this type of review is the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that failed to show a difference may not have been published. The authors are experts in the field and we believe that it is very unlikely that we have overlooked a significant contribution to this topic. The main bias associated with reviews of this type are the heterogeneity of the case mix and treatment regimens. Statistical tests for heterogeneity in this review show that this is unlikely to bias the conclusion although it is a major confounding variable when assessing the magnitude of the effects of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>One potential bias is acceptance of the Hazard Ratio quoted in the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>. These data were adjusted by the trial authors to account for perceived imbalances in treatment allocation state for stage. The validity of this and the interpretation of risk in this analysis can been criticised. There are good statistical reasons why the meta-analsyis should use the unadjusted HR. The estimated unadjusted HR from the survival curves for overall survival in <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> is estimated to be 0.74 (0.57 to 0.96). This is less impressive than the headline figure quoted by the trial authors (0.67 (0.51 to 0.88)). Nevertheless, even if the unadjusted and less dramatic headline figure is used, the calculated meta-analysis HR using the inverse variance random effects model remains similar. Sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that the analysis is robust even if the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-150" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 150</LINK> data are excluded on the basis that this is a trial of mixed tumours. Futhermore, the sensitivity analysis shows that the data are robust if different meta-analysis tools are used.</P>
<P>One other issue is the number of subgroup analyses. This review has deliberately chosen to publish the calculated difference in the primary outcome using several different tests. This is not normal good statistical practice. Statistics is an art and P value can change according to the chosen method of analysis. Therefore, multiple calculations risk producing a result that is statistically significant by chance alone. The traditional concept that a P value must be 5% or less now has less credibility than in the past. Doctors now appreciate that there in nothing magical about any specific cut-off point before declaring that a result is important. A P value below a defined cut-off level has impact value but it is the size of the effect that has clinical significance. In this analysis, the method of analysis is irrelevant to clinical practice. The basic conclusion is that the hazard ratio for death and recurrence is approximately 0.74 if chemotherapy is added and we can be 99.9% confident that this effect is small but real.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> was the first adjuvant study in endometrial cancer to claim a significant benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, controversy over the data analysis and control arm meant that the published conclusions have not been adopted as standard international practice. The early trial presentation was associated with the statistically significant effect seen only in a secondary analysis of the data, adjusted for perceived stage imbalance between the trial arms.The argument has been made that the chemotherapy arm had worse prognosis patients (presumably the Stage pT3c, however, lymph node involvement was not a prognostic variable in the study itself). The whole abdomen arm also had bad prognosis patients (pT3a with serosal/adnexal metastases). When the raw results are analysed, the difference in overall survival seen is not reflected in progression-free survival, which was not different between the arms. The statistical rationale for adjusting outcomes remains questionable. The history behind the trial begins with <LINK REF="REF-GOG-94" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOG 94</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GOG-107" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 107</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-GOG-94" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOG 94</LINK> was an observational cohort study of 180 women after maximally resected advanced endometrial carcinoma treated by adjuvant whole abdominal irradiation. The trial showed "tolerable toxicity". The frequency of severe or life-threatening adverse effects among 174 patients evaluable for radiation toxicity included 12.6% with bone marrow depression, 15% GI, and 2.2% hepatic toxicity. <LINK REF="STD-GOG-107" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 107</LINK> was an observational cohort study representing the other arm of GOG 122. Doxorubicin 60 mg/m² or doxorubicin 60 mg/m² plus cisplatin 50 mg/m² was given every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a total of 500 mg/m² doxorubicin. These toxicities and unconventional treatment regimens meant that the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK> results were not adopted universally by the oncology community.</P>
<P>The presentation of the <LINK REF="STD-NSGO" TYPE="STUDY">NSGO</LINK> data has been more persuasive. The data showed that adjuvant platinum based combination chemotherapy could reduce the risk of relapse with conventional statistical significance. Radiotherapy fields and doses were within those advocated by current guidelines. Overall survival was improved. The 93% certainty (probability = 0.07) of an effect from this single trial is strengthened by the recent supporting data from the EORTC and Italy ( NSGO, MaNGO and EORTC).</P>
<P>Review articles now tentatively promote the use of chemotherapy after hysterectomy for endometrial cancer if several poor prognosis features are seen on the hysterectomy specimen. The comprehensive review by <LINK REF="REF-Hogberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogberg 2008</LINK> explores the possible conclusions from the trials and makes the point that the <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK> and Italian GICOG trial need to be interpreted with caution because the study populations are heterogenous and there is no agreement on the optimal chemotherapy regimen. It is possible that any advantage for either treatment option might have been hidden by adverse events in the low risk population. This same phenomenon was a major flaw in some of the radiotherapy trials. These trials grouped all subjects together with the consequence that a possible survival benefit in women with micro metastatic disease was hidden by mixing the summary plots with data from women with a low risk cancer. In other words, the survival advantage from adjuvant treatment may have been obscured in the summary plots because the data were mixed with women who were very unlikely to have micro metastases. In addition, some chemotherapy regimens involved outdated, non platinum regimens or low dose doxorubicin (Adriamycin) combinations such as 40 mg/m² plus cisplatin 50 mg/m² plus either 333 mg/m² or 600 mg/m² of cyclophosphamide every four weeks. In contrast the GOG 122 showed an advantage to chemotherapy and used up to seven cycles doxorubicin 60 mg/m² plus up to eight cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m² every three weeks. The NSGO trial also suggests an advantage to chemotherapy and used more modern regimens based on at least 50 mg/m² of cisplatin or AUC 5 carboplatin with a second agent, either 175mg/m² paclitaxel, 50 mg/m² doxorubicin or other agent, usually every three to four weeks. It seems that the greatest advantage from chemotherapy comes from a higher dose regimen. However, not all reviewers agree. <LINK REF="REF-Stanojevic-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanojevic 2008</LINK> is cautious and concludes that there is insufficient evidence to base decisions with confidence, insufficient data to know who should benefit from adjuvant treatment and no good data to inform the clinician about the optimal regimen. <LINK REF="REF-Creutzberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creutzberg 2010</LINK> agrees and is worried about the toxicity. <LINK REF="REF-Amant-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amant 2007</LINK> comments that the optimal regimen is not known but promotes doxorubicin and cisplatin combinations whilst acknowledging the rising promise of paclitaxel. Both <LINK REF="REF-Obel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obel 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2008</LINK> support the view that Doxorubicin-cisplatin is still the standard chemotherapy regimen used in many centres despite the promise of paclitaxel-containing regimens and feel that adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be more effective than radiotherapy for type 1 cancers. <LINK REF="REF-Kodama-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kodama 2007b</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gadducci-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadducci 2007</LINK> are also encouraged by the data supporting the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and remind us that taxane platinum combinations are easier to tolerate and probably just as effective in advanced disease as the traditional more toxic regimens, Consequently it seems sensible to choose the less toxic option. The Japanese reviews are even more positive, presumably because of the influence of <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Hayakawa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayakawa 1995</LINK> advocates doxorubicin plus platinum for women with the following factors: G3; invasion to &gt; 1/2 myometrium; metastases to pelvic or para-aortic lymph node, isthumus-cervix extension; surgical stage III and the addition of cyclophosphamide for the poorer prognostic group. A German review (<LINK REF="REF-Fehr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehr 2006</LINK>) agrees that the anthracyclines, the platinum salts and the taxanes are all options and concludes (based on experience with metastatic disease) adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce recurrence rates from high-risk disease.</P>
<P>As well as expert opinion based on randomised trials, the literature contains reports of useful comparative studies. Unfortunately, they lack a well-designed control arm and this limits any conclusions that can be drawn but they are still worthy contributions. <LINK REF="REF-Hirai-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirai 2002</LINK> assessed 251 women treated with chemotherapy after hysterectomy for stage I endometrial cancer. Fifty-four women were picked out for analysis because they had lymph-vascular space invasion. There was a statistically significant difference in the 10 year overall survival favouring women receiving a variety of adjuvant chemotherapy agents (P = 0.02). <LINK REF="REF-Aoki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 2004</LINK> described 170 women with FIGO stage I and II endometrial cancer. Forty-one received adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin. When stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on a score system of prognostic factors (histologic grade 3, invasion of the outer half of the myometrium, lymph-vascular space invasion, and cervical invasion) the five-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were significantly better if women with high-risk disease received adjuvant chemotherapy. <LINK REF="REF-Kodama-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kodama 2007a</LINK>'s study of 167 women with surgically staged IB-II and IIIA (positive peritoneal cytology only) cancers included 58 patients (34.7%) who received cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and cisplatin or paclitaxel, pirarubicin and carboplatin. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 14 of 23 patients with histologic grade 3 tumours. Their five-year overall survival rate was 92.3%, significantly higher than the rate for women who had not received chemotherapy (50.0%). These studies imply that adjuvant chemotherapy might improve the survival in early-stage endometrial cancer patients with high-risk factors. However, the lack of a well-designed control arm and the obvious worry that the women who did not receive chemotherapy did not because they declined the additional treatment or were simply not fit enough for it means that the difference between the groups might have happened anyway. Nevertheless, it does offer some support to the belief that adjuvant chemotherapy has useful activity. Further but very limited support comes from similar non-randomised comparative studies. The prequel to <LINK REF="STD-J-GOG-2033" TYPE="STUDY">J GOG 2033</LINK> included the Japanese report of 81 women with high-risk endometrioid adenocarcinoma after hysterectomy who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (50 mg/m), doxorubicin (35 mg/m²), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m² given every three weeks. Data from 67 women who received whole pelvic irradiation with or without para-aortic irradiation were retrospectively examined as historical controls. The five-year overall survival rate for women receiving chemotherapy was 87% compared to 82% compared to the historical controls who received radiotherapy group (P = 0.1). Again bias means that the data have limited analytical value but the trend supporting advocates of chemotherapy is persistent.</P>
<P>The studies above represent some of the evidence to suggest that chemotherapy might have a role as a useful adjuvant therapy. However, the non-randomised comparative studies can do nothing more than suggest a role for chemotherapy. The comparative studies may not compare outcomes from similar groups and any reader must be left wondering how women were selected to receive the allocated treatment. The obvious worry about conclusions from the non randomised comparisons is that they study fitter women who can tolerate the more toxic treatment and their improved survival is because they were fitter. This is why conclusions about the efficacy of treatment are best based on a systematic analysis of randomised trials. However, the conclusions of this systematic review concord with all the other modern philosophers and this strongly suggests that we need to change practice and consider offering chemotherapy to selected women with high-risk disease after hysterectomy, either with or as an alternative to radiotherapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">What this review adds</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review also explored all the review papers from 2004 onwards. The strong consensus from these reviews is that chemotherapy has activity in endometrial cancer. There is no value in using it for women with a low risk of recurrence as they receive the toxicity of treatment and they only gain a small potential reduction in a risk that is already low. The harm will probably exceed the benefit. However, when the risk of recurrence is high, the potential advantage of treatment increases and this benefit may overtake the harm from the treatment toxicity. Multiple agents, higher doses and longer and more frequent courses add to treatment efficacy but there is a diminishing return. As the gain from adjuvant therapy is likely to be small and as many women with endometrial cancer have co-morbidities, the focus must be to move away from the traditional and relatively toxic combination of doxorubicin plus cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide to carboplatin with or without a taxane. The data in this review cannot add to the debate on the correct regimen as there are insufficient studies in adjuvant treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Fujimura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujimura 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Deng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Deng 2000</LINK> offer some insight but neither used the taxane-platinum option. We may know more about the added value of a taxane when the US Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) and the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (J GOG) report their randomised studies exploring taxane-platinum regimens. This review can only confirm that chemotherapy after surgery may have some activity and this may translate into either a survival advantage, longer disease free interval and a change in the pattern of recurrent disease.</P>
<P>The inconvenience and cost of chemotherapy are undeniable. They can be evaluated by experience and do not need quantification by a supporting randomised trial. Therefore it probably does not matter that there is no trial evaluating the option of carboplatin or platinum -taxane. The toxicity is known from experience and can be estimated for each patient by any experienced oncologist. What matters is that platinum based chemotherapy works, the gain is greatest in women with a higher risk of relapse and in those with a potentially long future ahead of them. An oncologist can now say that the benefits are real but small and therefore the chemotherapy regimens need to be individualised.</P>
<P>They may be a 7% survival advantage for high-risk women when four cycles of modern chemotherapy are added to radiotherapy. Some women might also find it a preferable alternative to radiotherapy.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-01 19:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-01 19:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This analysis suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce the risk of recurrent disease and improve the chance of surviving endometrial cancer. The analysis focusing on modern chemotherapy regimes suggests that 20 women required treatment in the trials for one to survive. The data also suggests that chemotherapy reduces the risk of death at any specific time by a quarter compared to not receiving it. We do not know who will benefit from chemotherapy or what drugs regimes to use but it seems logical to assume that most of the benefit is achieved with up to 4 course of platinum based therapy and the woman who gains most is the one with the highest risk of developing a distant metastasis. </P>
<P>Most women with few risk factors are already cured. The cost and harm from adjuvant therapy to this group exceeds the benefits even though a few will eventually suffer recurrent disease. The cost and toxicity for women with a high risk of recurrence will be the same but more women will have undiagnosed micrometastases after surgery and therefore more will be cured by adjuvant therapy. Concider an intermediate low risk cancer with a 4% risk of distant recurrence. Chemotherapy will only change her cancer death rate by 1% (HR=0.76). However, high risk cancer may have a 40% risk of recurrence. In this scenario, chemotherapy could benefit one in 10 by reducing the risk of cancer progression and death from 40% to 30%. </P>
<P>The difficult decision for the oncologist concerns the treatment regimes and patient selection. The survival advantage can be relatively small and there is a diminishing return from long courses of toxic combination regimes. The difficult issue for the woman with cancer is balancing the toxicity against the survival advantages and her natural life expectancy. Chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrent disease, increase her time before a recurrence and increase her overall survival chances. However, this needs to be traded against the side effect profiles. The combination of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be considered for women with a very high risk of metastatic disease who would otherwise have a long life expectancy. Another option is to use chemotherapy with brachytherapy as an alternative to pelvic radiotherapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-01 19:17:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This analysis makes it difficult to justify repeating the trials of chemotherapy versus no other treatment. The answer is clear. We now know that adjuvant chemotherapy works. The focus will now be on making chemotherapy more tolerable but this is not a matter for randomisation techniques. Most platinum based doublets are iso-effective and the effect of a third agent is likely to be so small that it could not be detected in any conventional sample size randomised trial. Cohort studies teach us about toxicity and tolerability and randomised trials of different regimens will not add any new revolutionary facts that will radically alter practice. Furthermore, the research dollar would be better spent elsewhere. The remaining questions that need randomised trials in this focused field related to concomitant chemoradiation and radiotherapy fields. Chemoradiation is clearly more effective than radiotherapy for cervix cancer and this needs to be tested against sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy for very high-risk early endometrial cancer. We also need to compare and contrast the toxicity of brachytherapy combined with chemotherapy against the toxicity of sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2011-06-01 11:02:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial protocol focused on the cure rates from endometrial cancer after hysterectomy. It was initially assumed that the participants would have cancer confined to the uterus (FIGO stage 1 or 2) but this failed to consider the fact that the FIGO stage is only diagnosed after surgery. Therefore the restriction on stage was dropped. The trial protocol also included progression-free survival as a primary outcome. This was demoted to a secondary outcome before any analysis simply because the lead author felt statistical purity demanded that there should be only one important primary outcome variable.</P>
<P>Before any data were collected, the lead author (NJ) decided to include the site of recurrence as a secondary outcome. NJ felt this was very important because of the related Cochrane Review of radiotherapy versus no other treatment in endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Kong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2007</LINK>). Its addition actually has minimal impact on this review but it is important to appreciate that these data were added after the protocol had been finalised and consequently the results will have less impact.</P>
<P>The initial protocol restricted the inclusion criteria to endometrial cancer. Since the development of the protocol, evidence has accumulated to show that a mixed mullerian mesenchymal malignant tumour (also called carcinosarcoma) is a poorly differentiated carcinoma. If this view is accepted, mixed mullerian mesenchymal malignant tumours should be included. Consequently, the search was expanded to include these tumours in 2010. However, the analysis is represented with and without these data for readers who are not persuaded mixed mullerian mesenchymal malignant tumours should be included.</P>

<P>320 women from 13 Nordic centres with surgical stage I, II, IIIA (positive peritoneal fluid cytology only), or IIIC (positive pelvic lymph nodes only) endometrial cancer participated. Women had histologically proven endometrial cancer of one of the following types: FIGO grade 3 (poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma) with infiltration &#8805; 50% of the myometrial thickness or any serous, clear cell or anaplastic carcinoma and women had to have had an endometrial cancer confined to the corpus cervix, regional lymph nodes or peritoneal fluid cytology. They were treated by hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and external beam radiotherapy. The trial recommended CT-based computer-aided 3-dimensional dose planning and four field technique. The prescribed dose to the target volume was at least 44 Gray. If other fractionations than 2.0 Gray five times per week were used, the dose was converted to a 2 Gray equivalent dose according to the linear quadratic formula. Brachytherapy was included as a part of the standard radiotherapy procedure in some centres and the decision to deliver brachytherapy was made before randomisation.<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Women were excluded if there was:</P>
<P>1. Any macroscopic postoperative residual tumour.<BR/>2. Spread of disease on the surface or outside the uterus (Exceptions: macroscopically radically excised pelvic lymph nodes or positive peritoneal fluid cytology allowed).<BR/>3. Macroscopic tumour involvement of the cervix at preoperative examination.<BR/>4. Para-aortic lymph node involvement.<BR/>5. Squamous carcinoma or small cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.<BR/>6. Preoperative irradiation.<BR/>7. Previous or concurrent malignant disease except for curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.<BR/>8. Active infection or other serious underlying medical condition, which might prevent the patient from receiving treatment or to be followed<BR/>9. Uncontrolled or potentially active site of pelvic infection (e.g. fistula or abscesses).<BR/>10. Inadequate bone marrow, liver, or kidney function (WBC &lt; 3.5x109/L, neutrophils &lt; 1.5x109/L, platelets &lt; 100x109/L S-creatinine &gt; upper normal value, total S-bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper normal value, estimated GFR &lt; 50 ml/min according to Cockroft-Gault or Jeliffe for patients who will be treated with cisplatin.<BR/>11. Previous extensive abdominal surgery or other condition that might give a substantial increase in the risk for complications from the radiation treatment or chemotherapy.<BR/>12.

<P>Comparisons of grade 3 to 4 haematologic toxicities between AP and WAI were: WBC (62% versus 4%, respectively), absolute neutrophil count (&lt; 85% versus 1%, respectively), platelets (21% versus 3%, respectively), and maximum haematologic toxicity (defined as percentage of patients who developed at least one grade 3 or 4 haematologic toxicity of any type; 88% versus 14%, respectively). The second most commonly reported acute toxicity was grade 3 to 4 GI toxicity, which was reported in 20% versus 13% of patients in the AP and WAI arms, respectively, and hepatic toxicity was reported in 1% versus 3% of patients in AP and WAI arms, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 cardiac and neurologic toxicities were seen in 15% and 7% of patients, respectively, receiving AP compared with 0% and less than 1% of patients, respectively, receiving WAI. Other infrequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities included hip osteonecrosis, vaginal vault necrosis, and dehydration (one patient each) in the WAI arm and ventral hernia (one patient) in the AP arm.</P>
<P>Quality of life was reported separately using the Fatigue Scale (FS), Assessment of Peripheral Neuropathy (APN), Functional Alterations due to Changes in Elimination (FACE), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), QoL measured at: pre-treatment, end of treatment (EOT), and 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Of 396 eligible patients, 317 provided a baseline QoL assessment. The AP arm produced a statistically significant survival benefit along with greater toxicities, including peripheral neuropathy persisting up to 6 months. WAI patients reported worse FS (P &lt; 0.001) and FACE (P &lt; 0.001) scores at EOT and poorer FACE scores 3 months post-treatment (P = 0.004) compared to AP patients.

<P>This study reported on the histological changes in 58 women treated for endometrial carcinoma with Estramustine phosphate (EMP) or radiotherapy. Estramustine (Emcyt, Estracit) is a chemotherapy agent commonly used to treat prostate cancer derived from estradiol with a nitrogen mustard-carbamate ester moiety that makes it an alkylating antineoplastic agent similar to mechlorethamine, with oestrogen-induced specificity. Women were randomly divided into three groups and clinically observed. Twenty-one women allocated oral Estramustine had 280 mg twice daily for 21 days before surgery and 19 women allocated radiotherapy received preoperative intra-cavity irradiation with half of the standard dosage. The control group involved 18 women who received surgical operation alone. The microscopic changes induced by irradiation were much heavier than those induced by chemotherapy. 5/21 women given Estramustine were found with no tumour lesion in the post operation samples, all of those five cases had strongly positive oestrogen receptors (++) and four of the five cases were well differentiated tumours before chemotherapy. In radiotherapy group, the tumour lesion disappeared in 6/19  cases, and five were moderately differentiated. No histopathological changes were seen in control group.   Immunohistochemical tests revealed a significant decrease in oestrogen receptor staining after Estramustine and a decrease in ki- 67 index, especially for the oestrogen receptor positive tumours. The ki-67 index reduced significantly from 49.5% before to 35.1% after medication (P &lt; 0.05).  </P>

Both at the initial data presentation and final publication two interpretations of the data were given.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The trial took 10 years to complete from 1992. As a consequence, the inclusion criteria were very broad. The study population included women with an exceptionally good prognosis after hysterectomy, others has an exceptionally bad prognosis. The adjuvant therapies are not optimal by current standards. A dose of 30 g in 20 fraction has only a 10% chance of eradicating upper abdominal disease. The survival curves converge and the benefit for chemotherapy is early and applies only to distant metastases. There was no stratification for risk, particularly site and volume of residuum and we do not know how well balanced the groups were with respect to specific risk factors. These criticisms were eloquently delivered by <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK> in a plenary session discussion available on the ASCO media player.</P>
<P>The authors of the definitive manuscript (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-122" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 122</LINK>) say that the treatment arms were balanced in terms of patient characteristics but there are slight imbalances with respect to mixed cell type and FIGO stage. If anything, there were slightly more poor prognosis pathologies and more advanced stage cancer in the group allocated chemotherapy.</P>

<P>This is predominantly a trial of advanced disease. Few participants had stage 1 or 2 cancer and the data may not be applicable to early disease.</P>
<P>The applicability of the &#8220;control&#8221; arm remains uncertain as this trial tests whole abdominal radiotherapy. The radiotherapy regimen used in GOG-122 was tested in only two prospective phase 2 studies, one of which reported after GOG-122 had completed randomisation. The first was <LINK REF="REF-GOG-9001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOG 9001</LINK> with ten women having whole abdominal radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy for resected stage pT3 to pT4 disease in 1990-1992. The second was <LINK REF="REF-GOG-94" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOG 94</LINK> and this is a description of 21women with stage pT1 to pT4 endometrial cancer. In 2010, whole abdominal radiotherapy in remains outside the standard treatments suggested by major guideline groups (<LINK REF="REF-IOG-_x0028_UK_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOG (UK)</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute_x002c_-USA" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute, USA</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-National-Comprehensive-Cancer-Network" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lukka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lukka 2006</LINK>).

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Other trials have used higher doses of chemotherapy and used a 3 weekly cycle, not 4 weekly.</P>
<P>The other issue worth of note is the inconsistent data reporting. In the early ASCO presentations of this trial , 208 women were described as having low or intermediate risk disease and 67 women had high-risk disease. The full report published in 2008 has slightly different numbers. According to the manuscript, 190<I> </I>women had low or intermediate risk disease, 120 had high intermediate risk group and 75 had high-risk disease.</P>
<P>Low intermediate risk was defined in the manuscript and as deeply invasive, well or moderately differentiated  cancer. Of the 190 women reported in the manuscript, the progression-free survival was 94.5% and 87.5% (P = 0.11) and overall 5 year survival was 95% and 91% (P = .2) associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy respectively.  Earlier presentations described 89.6% and 87.2%</P>
<P>The high intermediate risk group had deeply invasive poorly differentiated tumours and involved women over the age of 70 or they had stage 2 or 3a cancer. There were 120 women in the manuscript and there was significant progression-free survival advantage associated with chemotherapy HR = .44 (.20 to .97).</P>
<P>High-risk disease was defined as stage 2 and 3a in the ASCO presentation of 67 women and  they gained a substantial progression-free survival advantage (64.2% versus 84.5%; P = 0.06) and an overall survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (80.3% versus 97.5% P = 0.02). This benefit was not confirmed in the final manuscript. In fact, the manuscript describes a progression-free survival rate in this group at 5 years of 78.6% and 64.4% (P = 0.17) and the overall survival rate at 5 years of 75.7% and 71.1% respectively. This is now a non significant trend in favour of radiotherapy. Presumably the data matured with time as more events were reached.</P>

<P>The Nordic NSGO trial describes 320 women after EBRT and surgery. This data are combined with an additional 63 women in the EORTC study using the same study protocol. The hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival was 0.64 in favour of adding chemotherapy (95% CI 0.41 - 0.99; P = 0.046). The probability of surviving 5 years if treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy was 79% compared to 72% if radiotherapy alone was used on its own.</P>
<P>The Italian MaNGO ILIADE-3 trial describes 157 women after EBRT and surgery. Half had 3 course of cisplatin 50mg/m² + doxorubicin 60 mg/m² before the radiotherapy and half only had radiotherapy. The hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival was 0.61 in favour of adding chemotherapy (95% CI 0.33 - 1.12; P = 0.1). The probability of surviving 5 years if treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy was 78% compared to 73% if adjuvant treatment was restricted to radiotherapy only.</P>
<P>The Finish trial describes 156 women after EBRT and surgery. Half had the radiotherapy preceded, interrupted and topped up with cisplatin, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. The disease-specific overall five-year survival was 84.7% in women not receiving additional chemotherapy versus 82.1% in the group that did (P = 0.148). The median disease-free survival in women not receiving chemotherapy was 18 (range 9 to 36) months compared to 25 (range 12 to 49) months for women who received it (P = 0.134). The median time from surgery to recurrence was 15 (range 6 to 37) months in women not receiving chemotherapy, and 20 (range 8 to 60) months if they did (P = 0.170). Twenty-six patients died of the disease during the five-year follow-up, 11/72 from the group not given chemotherapy, and 15/84 from the group who received it. The patients succumbing from the group not receiving chemotherapy lived a median 23 (range 15 to 44) months as compared to 37 (range 13 to 50) months for those receiving it (P = 0.148).</P>
<P>The American GOG 34 trial is over 20 years old and describes 181 women after EBRT and surgery who had doxorubicin (45 mg/m²) or no adjuvant therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in survival or progression-free interval of the two arms.</P>

<P>The American GOG 122 trial compared whole-abdominal irradiation with chemotherapy in 422 women after surgery. The hazard ratio presented when the data were revealed was adjusted for stage, a post hoc statistical technique that many would reject. This adjustment to the data produced a hazard ratio for progression of 0.71 favouring chemotherapy (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91; P &lt; .01). At 60 months, 50% of women receiving chemotherapy were predicted to be alive and disease free when adjusting for stage compared with 38% of women receiving whole-abdominal irradiation. The stage-adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89; P &lt; .01) favouring doxorubicin-cisplatin chemotherapy. Again, adjusting the data for stage, at 60 months, 55% of women receiving doxorubicin-cisplatin were predicted to be alive compared with 42% of women allocated WAI.</P>
<P>The Italian GICOG trial compared adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy in 345 women after surgery. The 3, 5 and 7-year overall survivals were 76%, 66% and 62% associated with chemotherapy compared to 78%, 69% and 62% after radiotherapy. The 3, 5 and 7-year progression-free survivals were, respectively, 68%, 63% and 60% and 69%, 63% and 56%.</P>
<P>The Japanese J-GOG 2033 trial describes 384 women equally divided to adjuvant CAP chemotherapy or pelvic radiotherapy after surgery. This trial did not report any statistically significant differences in overall progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The five-year progression-free survival rates associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy was 81.8% and 83.5% respectively, while the five-year overall survival rates were 86.7% and 85.3% respectively. These rates were not significantly different if the analysis was restricted to a low- to intermediate-risk group (defined as stage IC patients under 70 years old with G1/2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma). However, chemotherapy was associated with a significantly higher progression-free survival rate (83.8% versus 66.2%, and higher overall survival rate (89.7% versus 73.6%) in a subgroup analysis of the 120 women with a high- to intermediate-risk cancer defined as invasion to the outer half of the myometrium in women over 70 years of age or G3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma or tumour involving any part of the cervix or positive cytology.</P>
<P>The American GOG 150 trial describes 206 women with a primary mixed mullerian tumour after surgery treated either by whole-abdominal irradiation or up to three cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide and mesna. The estimated crude probability of recurring within 5 years was 58% (WAI) and 52% (CIM). Adjusting for stage and age, the recurrence rate was 21% lower for CIM patients than for WAI patients, (relative hazard (RH) = 0.789, 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.530 to 1.176), P = 0.245, 2-tail test). The estimated death rate was 29% lower among the CIM group (RH = 0.712, 95% CI: 0.484 to 1.048).</P>
