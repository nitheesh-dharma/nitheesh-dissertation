Some people consider that certain types of neuropathic pain (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia, now known collectively as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)) are caused by the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathectomy is a destructive procedure that interrupts the sympathetic nervous system. Chemical sympathectomies use alcohol or phenol injections to destroy sympathetic nervous tissue (the so-called "sympathetic chain" of nerve ganglia). Surgical ablation can be performed by open removal or electrocoagulation (destruction of tissue with high-frequency electrical current) of the sympathetic chain, or by minimally invasive procedures using thermal or laser interruption. Nerve regeneration commonly occurs following both surgical or chemical ablation, but may take longer with surgical ablation.</P><P>This systematic review found only one small study (20 participants) of good methodological quality, which reported no significant difference between surgical and chemical sympathectomy for relieving neuropathic pain. Potentially serious complications of sympathectomy are well documented in the literature, and one (neuralgia) occurred in this study.</P><P>The practice of sympathectomy for treating neuropathic pain is based on very weak evidence. Furthermore, complications of the procedure may be significant.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:34:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:33:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>This review is an update of a review first published in Issue 2, 2003, which was substantially updated in Issue 7, 2010. The concept that many neuropathic pain syndromes (traditionally this definition would include complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS)) are "sympathetically maintained pains" has historically led to treatments that interrupt the sympathetic nervous system. Chemical sympathectomies use alcohol or phenol injections to destroy ganglia of the sympathetic chain, while surgical ablation is performed by open removal or electrocoagulation of the sympathetic chain or by minimally invasive procedures using thermal or laser interruption.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 09:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To review the evidence from randomised, double blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of chemical and surgical sympathectomy for neuropathic pain, including complex regional pain syndrome. Sympathectomy may be compared with placebo (sham) or other active treatment, provided both participants and outcome assessors are blind to treatment group allocation.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>On 2 July 2013, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database. We reviewed the bibliographies of all randomised trials identified and of review articles and also searched two clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to identify additional published or unpublished data. We screened references in the retrieved articles and literature reviews and contacted experts in the field of neuropathic pain.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-06-15 15:28:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>Randomised, double blind, placebo or active controlled studies assessing the effects of sympathectomy for neuropathic pain and CRPS. </P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:34:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and validity, and extracted data.

There was no comparison of sympathectomy versus sham or placebo. No dichotomous pain outcomes were reported. Average baseline scores of 8-9/10 on several pain scales fell to about 4/10 initially (1 day) and remained at 3-5/10 over four months. There were no significant differences between groups, except for "unpleasant sensation", which was higher with radiofrequency ablation. One participant in the phenol group experienced post sympathectomy neuralgia, while two in the radiofrequency group and one in the phenol group complained of paraesthesia during needle positioning<B>.</B> All participants had soreness at the injection site.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-05 09:48:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>The practice of surgical and chemical sympathectomy for neuropathic pain and CRPS is based on very little high quality evidence. Sympathectomy should be used cautiously in clinical practice, in carefully selected patients, and probably only after failure of other treatment options. In these circumstances, establishing a clinical register of sympathectomy may help to inform treatment options on an individual patient basis.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-28 10:05:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:55:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2010</LINK>), which itself updated an earlier review on 'Sympathectomy for neuropathic pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Mailis_x002d_Gagnon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mailis-Gagnon 2003</LINK>). We changed the title to more accurately reflect the scope of the review.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:47:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>The 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of neuropathic pain is "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system" (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2011</LINK>) based on an earlier consensus meeting (<LINK REF="REF-Treede-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treede 2008</LINK>). Neuropathic pain may be caused by nerve damage, but is often followed by changes in the central nervous system (CNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moisset-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moisset 2007</LINK>). This recent definition would not cover all disease entities included in a previous, rather broad IASP definition (<LINK REF="REF-Merskey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merskey 1994</LINK>), and in particular, it would probably exclude CRPS type I from being categorised as neuropathic pain. We wanted to be as inclusive as possible in the scope of our review and therefore considered all conditions that fulfil the old or new definition of neuropathic pain. To be unambiguous, the title of this review explicitly mentions CRPS.</P><P>Neuropathic pain is complex (<LINK REF="REF-Apkarian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apkarian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracey 2011</LINK>), and typical features can be found in patients with joint pain (<LINK REF="REF-Soni-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soni 2013</LINK>). It tends to be chronic and may be present for months or years. Many people are significantly disabled by moderate or severe pain.</P><P>In primary care in the UK the incidences, per 100,000 person years' observation, have been reported as 28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 27 to 30) for postherpetic neuralgia, 27 (95% CI 26 to 29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.1) for phantom limb pain, and 21 (95% CI 20 to 22) for painful diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). A study in the Netherlands estimated the incidence of CRPS as 26 per 100,000 person years (95% CI 23 to 30) (<LINK REF="REF-de-Mos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Mos 2007</LINK>), while an earlier smaller study in the USA reported an incidence of 5.5 per 100,000 person years, but using somewhat different diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Sandroni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandroni 2003</LINK>). Another estimate is that 1500 to 2000 cases of CRPS are diagnosed in Europe annually (<LINK REF="REF-Happak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Happak 2012</LINK>). Estimates vary between studies, often because of small numbers of cases. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia has been estimated at 4 in 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1994</LINK>), while more recently, a study of facial pain in The Netherlands found incidences per 100,000 person years of 12.6 for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9 for postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2009</LINK>). A systematic review of chronic pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, can be more common, with <I>prevalence</I> rates up to 400 per 100,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>), illustrating how common the condition was as well as its chronicity. The prevalence of neuropathic pain was reported as being 3.3% in Austria (<LINK REF="REF-Gustorff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustorff 2008</LINK>), 6.9% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 2008</LINK>), as high as 8% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>), and about 7% in a systematic review of studies published since 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>). Some forms of neuropathic pain, such as diabetic neuropathy and post surgical chronic pain (which is often neuropathic in origin), are increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>).</P><P>Neuropathic pain is known to be difficult to treat effectively, with only a minority of individuals experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from any one intervention. A multidisciplinary approach is now advocated, with pharmacological interventions being combined with physical and/or cognitive interventions. Conventional analgesics are usually not effective. Some patients may derive some benefit from a topical lidocaine patch or low concentration topical capsaicin, though evidence about benefits is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khaliq-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaliq 2007</LINK>). High concentration topical lidocaine may benefit some patients with postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>). Treatment is more usually by so-called unconventional analgesics such as antidepressants like duloxetine and amitriptyline (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>) or antiepileptics like gabapentin or pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>). An overview of treatment guidelines points out some general similarities, but also differences in approach (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2009</LINK>). The proportion of patients who achieve worthwhile pain relief (typically at least 50% pain intensity reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>)) is small, generally 10% to 25% more than with placebo, with numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTs) usually between 4 and 10.</P><P>Chronic painful conditions comprise five of the 11 top-ranking conditions for years lived with disability in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>), and are responsible for considerable loss of quality of life and employment and increased health costs (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:53:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Background and history</HEADING><P>The concept of a dysfunctional sympathetic nervous system contributing to neuropathic pain is not new. The term 'Sympathetically Maintained Pain' (SMP), defined as pain maintained by sympathetic efferent innervation or by circulating catecholamines, was originally coined by Roberts (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1986</LINK>). Many neuropathic pain syndromes, particularly CRPS types I and II, are thought to be SMP. Historically, this has led to attempts to interrupt the sympathetic nervous system dating back at least 80 years (<LINK REF="REF-Spurling-1930" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spurling 1930</LINK>). Temporary and non-destructive interruption can be performed through injections of local anaesthetics or botulinum toxin, while a longer-lasting, "destructive" interruption can be achieved chemically or surgically. Chemical sympathectomies use alcohol or phenol injections to destroy ganglia of the sympathetic chain, but this effect is temporary until regeneration of the sympathetic chain occurs, usually after three to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2008</LINK>). Surgical ablation can be performed by open removal or electrocoagulation of the sympathetic chain, or by minimally invasive procedures using stereotactic thermal or laser interruption. The effects may be longer-lasting, up to one year with radiofrequency ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2008</LINK>). This review will consider the evidence for chemical and surgical sympathectomy, but not for temporary non-destructive interventions such as local anaesthetics and botulinum toxin.</P><P>Shumacker reported in 1948 the dramatic cure of causalgia (now called CRPS) by either surgical sympathectomy or alcohol injection in 81% of 57 post-war cases (<LINK REF="REF-Shumacker-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumacker 1948</LINK>). However, long term follow-up of post-war cases is usually missing from this and other similarly old literature. Currently, the most common indications for chemical neurolysis of the stellate ganglion are: CRPS types I and II, post-herpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve, vasospastic conditions, and cancer pain of the face, neck, and upper extremities (<LINK REF="REF-Dobrogowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobrogowski 1995</LINK>). The bulk of experience concerning lumbar chemical neurolysis comes from the treatment of occlusive vascular diseases, but this procedure is also performed to treat cancer pain, CRPS types I and II, post-discectomy syndrome, phantom limb pain, herpes-zoster, and the early stages of post-herpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Dobrogowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobrogowski 1995</LINK>). The overwhelming indication for surgical sympathectomy is primary hyperhidrosis, while other indications for much smaller populations are neuropathic pain, vascular ischaemia, and Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2000</LINK>).</P><P>In 1996, Nath and colleagues conducted a literature review of surgical sympathectomy for reflex sympathetic dystrophy/CRPS (<LINK REF="REF-Nath-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nath 1996</LINK>). They concluded that sympathectomy should be reserved for patients with severe CRPS refractory to other treatment modalities. The reported results of the intervention varied widely but seemed to show a trend that sympathectomy was somewhat effective. However, <LINK REF="REF-Kingery-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingery 1997</LINK> reviewed the literature of controlled clinical trials for peripheral neuropathic pain and CRPS, and found no placebo-controlled trials to evaluate either local anaesthetic blocks of sympathetic ganglia or surgical sympathectomy. More recently Jackson and Gaeta (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2008</LINK>) reviewed neuroablation and again found the quality of the evidence poor, concluding that no one agent was demonstrably better than any other, and that for malignant pain "short-term pain relief may outweigh risk at end of life", but for chronic benign pain it should be a treatment of last resort after careful consideration. Cetas et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Cetas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cetas 2008</LINK>), in reviewing destructive procedures for nonmalignant pain, found few studies with sufficiently rigorous methods to avoid known biases, and additional problems of small study size (risk of random chance), mixed or poorly defined diagnoses, and inadequate follow up. They concluded that "efficacy has not been well established based on contemporary standards", and that "new, prospective, standardised studies are required .... to advance the field".</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Current practice</HEADING><P>Surgical sympathectomy for neuropathic pain or CRPS seems to be performed only rarely by vascular surgeons; if a sympathectomy is needed, then the more common procedure would be a percutaneous trial of local anaesthetic followed by either repeat with local anaesthetic or radiofrequency nerve ablation (RF). An alternative approach would be, after a trial of a local anaesthetic block, to inject 5 to 7 mL of phenol 6% or 10% either alone or in combination with RF. However, the majority of interventionalists would reserve the use of phenol for terminal cases because of the risk of the phenol leaking, and associated problems; reports of neuritis are not uncommon and paralysis has been reported.</P><P>Sympathectomy is not a commonly performed procedure, whichever method is used. For neuropathic pain or CRPS an initial local anaesthetic block, possibly repeated, may be followed by either RF or spinal cord stimulation (SCS); use of phenol is uncommon. Surgical division is uncommon for neuropathic pain or CRPS. For cancer or ischaemic leg pain, local anaesthetic block followed by RF or phenol, or both, might be used. Details are likely to vary in different parts of the world.</P><P>Computerised tomography (CT) is increasingly used to direct blocks, rather than using anatomical landmarks or image intensifier techniques. The facilities required and the number of procedures required to maintain clinical skills would suggest that fewer people are regularly performing these blocks. Although ultrasound is becoming more widely used for chronic pain blocks, its use for sympathectomy appears to be uncommon.</P></SUBSECTION></INTERVENTION><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-28 08:55:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Because neuropathic pain is a common disease and sympathectomy is an invasive intervention with potentially serious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2000</LINK>), there is a need for a systematic review of the efficacy and associated harms of sympathectomy for neuropathic pain, using strict inclusion criteria regarding study quality and validity that minimise biases.</P><P>The first review in 2003 included one randomised trial that was not blinded, two retrospective chart reviews and one prospective observational study.

A meta-analysis on causalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Hassantash-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassantash 2003</LINK>) included 110 articles (case series and case reports) and 1528 participants. Seven hundred and ninety-one participants were treated with sympathectomy of the diseased extremity. In 721 participants (91%) the condition responded. In 21 cases where the first sympathectomy was unsuccessful, a second sympathectomy was performed and was always successful. According to <LINK REF="REF-Hassantash-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassantash 2003</LINK>, therefore, a total of 94% of participants were "cured" by sympathectomy. A systematic review on the effectiveness and complications of chemical sympathectomy for neuropathic pain of the extremities, including controlled and non-controlled studies, described meaningful pain relief (there defined based on degree and duration (&gt; 2 weeks) of pain relief) in 28/63 (44%) participants and non-meaningful pain relief in 12/63 participants (19%); in 23/63 participants (37%) the pain relief could not be classified (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2001</LINK>).</P><P>In comparison with other treatments, lower quality evidence suggests that sympathectomy is at least not inferior. A retrospective review of patient charts of 27 CRPS patients (<LINK REF="STD-Greipp-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Greipp 1990</LINK>) found that the four treatment methods physiotherapy, physiotherapy plus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), nerve blocks, and sympathectomy provided participants with at best temporary pain relief. Outcomes were similar with the different treatment methods.</P><P>Similarly, current evidence does not support large differences in efficacy between different types of sympathectomy. A randomised but not double blind trial with 17 participants with reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the lower extremities (CRPS type I) (<LINK REF="STD-Haynsworth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haynsworth 1991</LINK>) found that radiofrequency sympathectomy produced sympatholysis similar to that produced by phenol, although with a lower incidence of post-sympathectomy neuralgia. A non-randomised and non-blinded prospective observational study with 14 participants with upper or lower extremity CRPS (<LINK REF="STD-Mailis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mailis 1994</LINK>) found that surgical and phenol sympathectomy produced similar rates of pain relief in the short term. In the long term there was a non-significant trend for better outcomes in the phenol group. More recently, 12 of 16 patients with a CRPS type II of the upper or lower limb showed significant improvement in limb function, the visual analogue scale, and the Nottingham Health Profile following regional subcutaneous venous sympathectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Happak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Happak 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Regarding adverse events, the study included in this review found that all participants complained of soreness at the site of injections lasting 5 to 7 days and that one participant in the phenol group experienced post sympathectomy neuralgia. A systematic review investigating the late complications of surgical sympathectomies for a range of indications (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2000</LINK>) found that neuropathic complications (after cervico-dorsal and lumbar surgical sympathectomy) occurred in 11.9% of all participants. However, they were more common if the indication was neuropathic pain rather than palmar hyperhidrosis (25.2% versus 9.8%). The same review found that, with cervico-dorsal sympathectomy, compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 52.3%, gustatory sweating in 32.3%, phantom sweating in 38.6%, and Horner's syndrome in 2.4% of participants.</P><P>There were no studies or reviews comparing sympathectomy with SCS. This is important in the UK, where the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued a technology appraisal guidance for SCS as a treatment option for adults with chronic pain of neuropathic origin who continue to experience chronic pain (at least 50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale) for at least six months despite appropriate conventional medical management, and who have had a successful trial of stimulation, but not for pain of ischaemic origin, except as part of a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-28 09:14:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-28 09:13:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>The first update (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2010</LINK>) of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mailis_x002d_Gagnon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mailis-Gagnon 2003</LINK>) used refined inclusion criteria. It demonstrated that the practice of sympathectomy for neuropathic pain is based on little high quality evidence. This current update did not identify any additional information. Only one pilot study, with 20 participants and in CRPS type I (which cannot serve as a model for other neuropathic pain conditions), satisfied our inclusion criteria. There was no comparison of sympathectomy versus sham or placebo. Lower quality evidence seems to suggest that sympathectomy for neuropathic pain can work, at least in some cases. The risk-benefit assessment is complicated by the fact that serious complications of sympathectomy are common. Because there is no good evidence for the effectiveness of sympathectomy&#65293;particularly with regard to long term effectiveness outcomes&#65293;it should be used with caution, in carefully selected patients, after thorough assessment, and probably only after failure of other treatment options or in palliative cases, or both. This stands in contrast to the use of pharmacotherapy in neuropathic pain, where there is high quality evidence (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>).</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-28 09:14:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>High quality evidence from double blind RCTs with placebo (sham) comparators would be needed to determine whether sympathectomy is effective in the relief of neuropathic pain. Studies would need to be conducted in different neuropathic pain syndromes to determine when&#65293;if at all&#65293;sympathectomy is effective. Studies would also need to assess different types of sympathectomy to determine which is best. Furthermore, comparison would be needed with less invasive techniques (neuropathic pain medications, local anaesthetic blocks, and botulinum toxin). Double-blinding is needed to ensure high study quality and guard against biases but would be a considerable challenge in direct comparisons between sympathectomy and less invasive techniques and would probably involve sham procedures in some participants.</P><P>Given the adverse event profile associated with sympathectomy and given the known, albeit limited, efficacy for pharmacotherapy in neuropathic pain, the question arises of whether large double blind RCTs are likely to be conducted. Furthermore, there may be ethical arguments against conducting such trials other than in selected individuals (after failure of pharmacotherapy). It would, however, be helpful to compile a registry of sympathectomy cases.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2013-08-28 09:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The first version of this review was authored by Angela Mailis-Gagnon and Andrea D Furlan.

It included only studies of the highest methodological quality (randomised and double blind) because these are known to be less prone to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), which is of utmost importance in pain studies where outcomes are subjective, and used more rigorous outcomes as defined by the IMMPACT group (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>).</P><P>This update did not identify any new studies, but the Risk of bias assessment has been expanded and a Summary of findings table included, in keeping with methodological advances in recent Cochrane reviews.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2018-02-26 11:27:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry L D Harding"><P>A restricted search in February 2018 did not identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. The review will be re-assessed for updating in two years. If appropriate, we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions</P></PUBLIC_NOTES></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-02-27 11:46:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry Harding">
