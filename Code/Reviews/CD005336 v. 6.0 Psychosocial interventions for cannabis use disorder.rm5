<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cannabis use disorder is the most common illegal substance use disorder in the general population. Despite the large number of cannabis users seeking treatment, clinical trials conducted to explore the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder are rare.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Review authors included a total of 23 studies involving 4045 adult participants who used cannabis frequently. This review included participant groups made up of at least 70% daily or near daily users, or reported to have cannabis use disorder, or seeking treatment for cannabis use. Average age of participants was 28.2 years. Most participants were male (72.5% on average, excluding two trials that recruited only females). Most (15) studies were conducted in the USA, two in Germany, two in Australia and one each in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Ireland.</P>
<P>Studies compared seven different intervention types: cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational intervention (MET), a combination of MET and CBT (MET + CBT), contingency management (CM), social support (SS), mindfulness-based meditation (MM) and drug education and counselling (DC).</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>Similar to other illicit drug disorders, cannabis use disorder is not easily treated by psychosocial interventions provided in out-patient and community settings. CBT in individual and group sessions and MET in individual sessions were the most consistently explored treatments; they have demonstrated effectiveness over control conditions. In particular, psychosocial treatment was consistently effective over no treatment in reducing the frequency of cannabis use (with nine studies showing superior outcomes and four showing comparable outcomes), quantity used per occasion (seven studies showing superior outcomes and two showing comparable outcomes) and severity of dependence (with seven studies showing superior outcomes and two showing comparable outcomes). In contrast, treatment was not likely to be more effective than no treatment in improving cannabis-related problems (with four studies showing superior outcomes and seven showing comparable outcomes), motivation to quit (with no studies showing superior outcomes and three showing comparable outcomes), other substance use (with no studies showing superior outcomes and seven showing comparable outcomes) or mental health (with no studies showing superior outcomes and five showing comparable outcomes). Comparison of studies reporting treatment gains was possible for a subset of studies with short-term follow-up of approximately four months. This analysis found that those receiving any intervention reported fewer days of cannabis use, used fewer joints per day and reported fewer symptoms of dependence and fewer cannabis-related problems. High-intensity interventions of more than four sessions and those delivered over longer than one month, particularly MET + CBT interventions, were most effective. In addition, interventions were completed as intended by most participants. Notably, three studies investigated the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention compared with treatment as usual delivered at psychiatric out-patient centres and reported little evidence of significant group differences in treatment outcomes. Finally, results from six studies, which included contingency management adjunct treatments, were mixed but suggested that improvements in cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence were likely when combined with CBT or with MET + CBT. Invesigators reported no adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to July 2015. Two review authors (Le Foll and Copeland) received donations of nabiximols (Sativex) from GW Pharma, although no review authors received direct funding to complete this review. The quality of evidence among primary outcomes was very low to moderate and suffered serious limitations, as no trial assessed all treatment outcomes of interest, and variability among included measures was great. In addition, assessment of other substance use, including tobacco use, or use of additional treatments during the trial period was scarce. Participant drop-out was also a concern; on average, more than 20% of participants across studies were lost at final follow-up, but most studies addressed attrition bias via appropriate analysis plans. In contrast, we found little evidence of selective reporting or selection bias.</P>

<P>Cannabis use disorder is the most commonly reported illegal substance use disorder in the general population; although demand for assistance from health services is increasing internationally, only a minority of those with the disorder seek professional assistance. Treatment studies have been published, but pressure to establish public policy requires an updated systematic review of cannabis-specific treatments for adults.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-27 21:42:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (compared with inactive control and/or alternative treatment) delivered to adults in an out-patient or community setting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-27 21:42:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulaive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and reference lists of articles. Searched literature included all articles published before July 2015.</P>

<P>All randomised controlled studies examining a psychosocial intervention for cannabis use disorder (without pharmacological intervention) in comparison with a minimal or inactive treatment control or alternative combinations of psychosocial interventions.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:29:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 23 randomised controlled trials involving 4045 participants. A total of 15 studies took place in the United States, two in Australia, two in Germany and one each in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil and Ireland. Investigators delivered treatments over approximately seven sessions (range, one to 14) for approximately 12 weeks (range, one to 56).</P>
<P>Overall, risk of bias across studies was moderate, that is, no trial was at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias or reporting bias. Further, trials included a large total number of participants, and each trial ensured the fidelity of treatments provided. In contrast, because of the nature of the interventions provided, participant blinding was not possible, and reports of researcher blinding often were unclear or were not provided. Half of the reviewed studies included collateral verification or urinalysis to confirm self report data, leading to concern about performance and detection bias. Finally, concerns of other bias were based on relatively consistent lack of assessment of non-cannabis substance use or use of additional treatments before or during the trial period.</P>
<P>A subset of studies provided sufficient detail for comparison of effects of any intervention versus inactive control on primary outcomes of interest at early follow-up (median, four months). Results showed moderate-quality evidence that approximately seven out of 10 intervention participants completed treatment as intended (effect size (ES) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.78, 11 studies, 1424 participants), and that those receiving psychosocial intervention used cannabis on fewer days compared with those given inactive control (mean difference (MD) 5.67, 95% CI 3.08 to 8.26, six studies, 1144 participants). In addition, low-quality evidence revealed that those receiving intervention were more likely to report point-prevalence abstinence (risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.83, six studies, 1166 participants) and reported fewer symptoms of dependence (standardised mean difference (SMD) 4.15, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.63, four studies, 889 participants) and cannabis-related problems compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.34, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.42, six studies, 2202 participants). Finally, very low-quality evidence indicated that those receiving intervention reported using fewer joints per day compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.55, 95% CI 2.51 to 4.59, eight studies, 1600 participants). Notably, subgroup analyses found that interventions of more than four sessions delivered over longer than one month (high intensity) produced consistently improved outcomes (particularly in terms of cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence) in the short term as compared with low-intensity interventions.</P>
<P>The most consistent evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and particularly their combination for assisting with reduction of cannabis use frequency at early follow-up (MET: MD 4.45, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.00, four studies, 612 participants; CBT: MD 10.94, 95% CI 7.44 to 14.44, one study, 134 participants; MET + CBT: MD 7.38, 95% CI 3.18 to 11.57, three studies, 398 participants) and severity of dependence (MET: SMD 4.07, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.17, two studies, 316 participants; MET + CBT: SMD 7.89, 95% CI 0.93 to 14.85, three studies, 573 participants), although no particular intervention was consistently effective at nine-month follow-up or later. In addition, data from five out of six studies supported the utility of adding voucher-based incentives for cannabis-negative urines to enhance treatment effect on cannabis use frequency. A single study found contrasting results throughout a 12-month follow-up period, as post-treatment outcomes related to overall reduction in cannabis use frequency favoured CBT alone without the addition of abstinence-based or treatment adherence-based contingency management. In contrast, evidence of drug counselling, social support, relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation was weak because identified studies were few, information on treatment outcomes insufficient and rates of treatment adherence low. In line with treatments for other substance use, abstinence rates were relatively low overall, with approximately one-quarter of participants abstinent at final follow-up. Finally, three studies found that intervention was comparable with treatment as usual among participants in psychiatric clinics and reported no between-group differences in any of the included outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention were raised and partially resolved. Generalisability of findings was unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable although comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention was shown, in comparison with minimal treatment controls, to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least in the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention provided over more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence-based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cannabis use disorder is the most commonly reported illegal substance use disorder in the general population; demand for assistance from a health professional is increasing internationally (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014b</LINK>). Despite this, only a minority of those with a disorder seek professional assistance, and no particular treatment method or design is widely accepted and practiced. This review aimed to identify those psychosocial interventions for cannabis use that demonstrate improved outcomes in comparison with inactive control and/or alternative treatment conditions.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Population-based studies have consistently revealed that cannabis is the most widely used illegal substance in Western countries including Europe (5.7% reporting past year use; <LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014a</LINK>), North America (7.5% reporting past month use; <LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2014</LINK>) and Australia (10.2% reporting past year use; <LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2014a</LINK>). In many countries, among those accessing treatment for drug use disorders, cannabis is more commonly the principal drug of concern than heroin (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnostic criteria for cannabis use disorder are described in the <I>Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition</I> (DSM-V) (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_V-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-V 2013</LINK>), and the <I>10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</I> (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). The distinction between cannabis abuse and dependence has been replaced by a unidimensional symptom count indicating severity of cannabis use disorder and a requirement of two or more symptoms for diagnosis.</P>
<P>Cannabis use disorder is characterised by a pattern of cannabis use that can cause clinically significant psychiatric distress (somatisation, depression, anxiety, irritability, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism) and social impairment (family member complaining, lost friends, financial difficulty, impaired work or school performance, legal problems), as well as multiple adverse consequences associated with cannabis use (inability to stop using, feeling bad about using, procrastinating, loss of self confidence, memory loss and withdrawal symptoms) and repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop using (<LINK REF="REF-Budney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budney 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1993a</LINK>). Cannabis use persists despite these negative consequences, and most individuals with cannabis use disorder perceive themselves as unable to quit (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copeland-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 2001b</LINK>). It is very common for cannabis users to present with other substance use problems, most notably those related to use of tobacco. In fact, most cannabis users also smoke tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-Badiani-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badiani 2015</LINK>), and smoking tobacco may potentiate cannabis dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Hindocha-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hindocha 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lifetime rates of cannabis use disorder - according to the recent DSM-V classification - have been estimated at 5.4% in the Australian general population (<LINK REF="REF-Mewton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mewton 2013</LINK>) and 6.3% in the US population (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2015</LINK>), with national estimates from other countries yet to be published under this new classification. Epidemiological studies have estimated that around one in six of those who use cannabis during adolescence and one in two of daily cannabis users will meet the criteria for cannabis dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony_x002c_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony, 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Pol_x002c_-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Pol, 2013</LINK>). Certain factors have been identified to be significantly associated with increased risk of cannabis use disorder diagnosis, including being male (<LINK REF="REF-Haberstick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haberstick 2014</LINK>) or meeting criteria for diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or affective disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Teesson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teesson 2012</LINK>). Indeed, on the basis of a database representative of the US population, it has been estimated that 7% of males and 5.3% of females with lifetime exposure to cannabis will develop cannabis dependence at some point in life (<LINK REF="REF-Lev_x002d_Ran-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lev-Ran 2013</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite these high levels of problematic use, only a minority of people who use cannabis seek assistance from a health professional (<LINK REF="REF-Teesson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teesson 2012</LINK>). The demand for treatment for cannabis use disorder, nonetheless, is increasing internationally. In 1999, the US Treatment Episode Data Set recorded more than 220,000 admissions to publicly funded substance abuse treatment (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2002</LINK>), primarily for cannabis use. This represented 14% of admissions to these facilities and a doubling of the rate since 1993. In 2000, that data set reported that cannabis accounted for 61% of all adolescent admissions (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2003</LINK>), and in 2010, this prevalence was 49.5% among those 18 to 30 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2013</LINK>). Australia has also seen a doubling in rates of cannabis treatment from 2000 to 2013, with the current rate fluctuating between 22% and 24% since 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2015</LINK>). Indeed, the number of cannabis patients entering treatment has increased in the 25 countries across the globe for which data are available (from 73,000 in 2005 to 106,000 in 2010) (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary treatment options for cannabis use disorder include cognitive-behavioural and motivational approaches, which identify the importance of the individual or the social environment. These types of treatment approaches are collectively referred to as psychosocial treatments. More specifically, cognitive-behavioural and relapse prevention approaches primarily emphasise identification and management of incremental patterns and thoughts, as well as external triggers, that lead to use. In addition, these approaches teach coping and problem-solving skills and promote substitution of cannabis-related behaviours with healthier alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1993</LINK>). In contrast, motivational interviewing approaches tend to emphasise the importance of self efficacy and positive change and attempt to build motivation in an empathic and non-judgemental environment (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>). This approach is often enhanced by personalised feedback and education regarding the treatment seeker's patterns of cannabis use, becoming motivational enhancement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1992</LINK>). Both approaches can be delivered in an individual or group format and include family and friends for social support. Aside from these primary treatments, secondary options include mindfulness-based meditation and drug counselling. Mindfulness-based meditation is a new approach that promotes inner reflection and acceptance of experiences and negative affect, thus decreasing the impact of triggers of use by enhancing present-moment awareness (<LINK REF="REF-Praissman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Praissman 2008</LINK>). Drug counselling refers to simple fact-based education regarding drug use and health risks, along with suggestions for minimising harm and brief components from cognitive-behavioural and motivational approaches. In addition, all of these treatments can be augmented with pharmacotherapy (medications to assist with cannabis withdrawal and reduce cravings) and/or contingency management techniques (financial incentives for abstinence or successful engagement in treatment). Finally, given the high frequency of tobacco use among those presenting for cannabis treatment, their shared triggers of use and the negative impact of tobacco use on cannabis treatment outcomes, it is suggested that use of both substances should be treated simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Agrawal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agrawal 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until recently, relatively little research has focused on approaches to treatment for cannabis use disorder. A major factor contributing to lack of clinical research focus on this disorder is that many users believe that cannabis use does not produce a dependence syndrome, and that treatment to assist with quitting is not desired or needed (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2012</LINK>). However, since the time an initial survey was carried out in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Roffman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roffman 1987</LINK>), research has confirmed that individuals with cannabis-related problems readily respond to advertisements for treatment, and most do not use other substances (<LINK REF="REF-Budney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budney 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copeland-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1993a</LINK>). Original cannabis-specific programmes in the USA and Australia may have legitimised the need for treatment related to cannabis abuse or dependence, reduced the stigma associated with drug abuse treatment and attracted patients who otherwise would be reluctant to approach counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Copeland-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1993a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the bulk of substance use treatment literature has focused on alcohol consumption and other illicit drug use, a widening evidence base regarding psychosocial treatment for cannabis use disorder has emerged. Several narrative reviews of cannabis treatment trials from separate author groups have highlighted support for psychosocial intervention in managing cannabis use disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Budney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copeland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McRae-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McRae 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordstrom-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrom 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winstock-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winstock 2010</LINK>). These reviews discuss the importance of addressing co-morbid mental health concerns involving social support, establishing healthy distractions from cravings and teaching harm reduction techniques when these distractions fail. Approaches that combine cognitive-behavioural and motivational enhancement techniques share the greatest support in these reviews, but it is noted that the supporting evidence lacks methodological rigour and standardised outcome measures across studies.</P>

<P>Treatment development and efficacy studies targeting cannabis use disorder began to appear in the scientific literature during the 1990s; almost two decades later, testing of pharmacological preparations was begun to determine their effectiveness in managing cannabis use disorder. Following a recent Cochrane review on pharmacotherapies, no medications have emerged with proven effectiveness for the treatment of cannabis use disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2014</LINK>), leaving psychosocial treatments as the mainstay. Although several narrative reviews of existing literature have focused on psychosocial treatment of cannabis use disorder, to our knowledge only five systematic reviews have been published, and each included limited samples. The first described prevention programmes specifically developed for adolescent cannabis use within schools (<LINK REF="REF-Tobler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobler 1999</LINK>). The second recounted all substance use by dependent adults; although cannabis treatments were reviewed separately, this review included only five treatment trials and provided results that are now somewhat outdated (<LINK REF="REF-Dutra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutra 2008</LINK>). The third review focused on adolescent cannabis users and community-delivered treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 2011</LINK>). The fourth included only individuals who were actively seeking treatment and excluded users who were offered treatment following identification of problematic use (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2014</LINK>). Finally, the fifth review (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 2006</LINK>) served as the foundation for the current review.. Notably, each of these reviews highlighted only modest support for the the community-delivered treatments described.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-27 22:38:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To limit bias, gain insight into potential comparisons and guide interpretation of findings, two review authors (PG and PS), using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> version 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies. In the context of a systematic review, the validity of a study refers to the extent to which its design and conduct were likely to prevent systematic errors or bias (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>). We changed the criteria to include assessment of risk of bias of included studies to conform with recommended methods outlined in the most recent version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and the requirements of RevMan5.3. We assessed new studies and re-assessed studies already included in the old review by using the criteria and methods indicated in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias of studies included in Cochrane reviews is based on evaluation of six specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues). For each study, we analysed the six domains, described them as reported in the study and offered a final judgement on the likelihood of bias. The first portion of the assessment tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second portion involves assigning a judgement related to risk of bias for that entry, in terms of low, high or unclear risk.</P>
<P>To make these judgements, we used the criteria indicated in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and as applied to the field of addiction. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for details.

<P>Several studies did not include participants on the basis of assessment of cannabis use disorder but instead used a cutoff based on frequency of cannabis use.

Therefore, participants from all studies were at high risk of performance bias. This was not the case for the outcome assessor, who could be blinded. With regards to subjective outcomes, a total of eight studies used blinded outcome assessors and therefore were at low risk of performance bias;12 studies did not report whether outcome assessors were blinded and were at unclear risk of performance bias. The remaining three studies reported that outcome assessors were not blinded; these studies were at high risk of performance bias. With regards to objective outcomes, 13 studies included collateral estimates or urinary analysis (which could not be affected by blinding) and therefore were at low risk of performance bias. In contrast, nine studies did not assess objective outcomes, but because correlation between objective and subjective measures of cannabis use is high, it was unclear whether these studies were at risk of performance bias.</P>

In contrast, no significant between-group differences were found between MET (two sessions, delivered to individuals) and CBT (14 sessions, delivered to groups of eight to 12) up to twelve-month follow-up (MD -0.86, 95% CI -3.86 to 2.14, one study, 179 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2000</LINK>). Further, no significant differences were noted between four-session MET and a more intensive 14-session MET + CBT intervention at end of treatment (MD -2.80, 95% CI -9.94 to 4.34, one study, 31 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>)), although MET was inferior to a similar MET + CBT + CM-abs intervention (MD -7.30, 95% CI -13.68 to -0.92, one study, 30 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>)) (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>). Similarly, a two-session MET was inferior to a nine-session MET + CBT + CM-abs intervention across nine-month follow-up (MD -4.96, 95% CI -7.18 to -2.74, one study, 266 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>)), although this study was at high risk of detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-MTPRG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MTPRG 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>In addition to the mentioned comparison between CBT and MET, CBT-based interventions were compared with alternative treatments in three studies. Twelve-session CBT was found to be superior to a similar intervention paired with the addition of CM-abs or CM-adh across 12-month follow-up post treatment, although no significant differences were noted between CBT and CM-abs unpaired (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2012</LINK>). A separate study found no significant differences at 12 months regarding comparisons between CBT + CM-abs or CBT + CM-adh versus CM-abs delivered unpaired (MD 4.90, 95% CI -1.95 to 11.75, one study, 43 participants; MD -0.70, 95% CI -7.61 to 6.21, one study, 46 participants) or between CBT + CM-adh and CBT + CM-abs (MD 5.60, 95% CI -1.65 to 12.85, one study, 45 participants) (although this study was at high risk of detection bias; <LINK REF="STD-Budney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2006</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">MET + CBT versus alternative treatment</HEADING>
<P>A total of two additional studies compared MET + CBT-based interventions versus alternative treatments. No significant group differences were found when eight-session MET + CBT was compared with DC across six-month follow-up, but both were found to be inferior when delivered alone as compared with delivery plus addition of CM-abs and CM-adh (study authors reported the effect of adding CM as d = 0.29, 95% CI &#8211;0.06 to 0.64) (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2006</LINK>). In addition, a study comparing MET + CBT, MET + CBT + CM-abs, CM-abs alone and a non-drug health promotion control found that CM-abs alone showed effectiveness in rates of continuous abstinence at three-month follow-up, and MET + CBT + CM-abs was superior at 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kadden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kadden 2007</LINK>). No other between-group differences were reported for this outcome. A final study compared MET + CBT + CM-abs and MET + CBT-adh versus each other and versus an assessment-only control condition across 12 months (although this study was at high risk of detection and other bias; <LINK REF="STD-Litt-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Litt 2013</LINK>). Although MET + CBT + CM-abs was found to be superior to MET + CBT + CM-adh (each nine sessions) at five- to eight-month follow-up assessments, neither intervention was superior to the assessment-only control.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">CM versus alternative treatment</HEADING>
<P>Finally, several studies investigated the impact of CM-abs and CM-adh as adjunct treatments to MET, CBT and MET + CBT interventions.

Two studies compared use of CM-abs adjunct treatment versus CM-adh adjunct treatment. Neither study found any significant between-group differences at 12 months (although both studies were at high risk of detection bias; <LINK REF="STD-Budney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litt-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Litt 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of reduction in frequency of cannabis use</HEADING>
<P>Most notably, few active intervention comparisons showed significant differences between groups with regards to reductions in frequency of cannabis use from six-month follow-up onwards (with longest follow-up at 16 months from baseline). This included CBT + CM-abs versus CBT + CM-adh versus CM-abs alone (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2006</LINK>); six-session CBT versus single-session CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Copeland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Copeland 2001</LINK>); DC versus psychosis treatment as usual control (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>); MET + CBT versus inactive control (<LINK REF="STD-Hoch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hoch 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hoch 2014</LINK>); MET versus inactive control (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2011</LINK>); RP versus SS (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 1994</LINK>); CBT versus MET (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2000</LINK>); MET versus drug-related health education (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>) and DC delivered orally or by workbook versus non-drug health promotion control (although this study was at unclear or high risk across most assessments of bias; <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2012</LINK>). Studies showed five notable exceptions to this lack of treatment effectiveness in the prior six months. First, a nine-session MET + CBT + CM-abs intervention outperformed a MET + CBT + CM-adh intervention for up to 12 months (all nine sessions; <LINK REF="STD-Litt-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Litt 2013</LINK>). Second, a nine-session MET + CBT intervention outperformed a shorter two-session counterpart for up to 15 months (<LINK REF="STD-MTPRG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MTPRG 2004</LINK>). Third, CBT + CM-abs showed improved outcomes compared with CM-abs alone (each 14 sessions) at 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2006</LINK>). Fourth, a single-session MET intervention was superior to a single session of drug-related health education at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>). Fifth, a 12-session CBT intervention showed superior outcomes when delivered unpaired by CM-abs or CM-adh over 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2012</LINK>). Finally, MET + CBT + CM-abs was superior to MET + CBT, DC and CM-abs interventions at 12 months, although only in terms of continuous abstinence rates, not in terms of past month point-prevalence estimates (<LINK REF="STD-Kadden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kadden 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have provided a further summary of units of measurement and all included study findings regarding the impact of intervention and control on frequency of cannabis use from baseline to follow-up in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>As such, the intervention with the best evidence for reducing frequency of cannabis use is likely to be a MET + CBT combination enhanced by abstinence-based CM when available. In the absence of CM, MET + CBT is likely to remain effective, although improvements may not be as immediately noticeable. Although the optimum number of sessions is not clear, evidence suggests that more intensive interventions of longer than four sessions are likely to be superior to less intensive interventions, at least in the short term. Notably, the quality of evidence for reductions in frequency of cannabis use over the short term was considered moderate according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) assessment of quality, that is, three studies were at high risk of bias, data conversions were required to standardise the period of frequency assessed across studies and follow-up assessment periods varied between studies.</P>

<P>Very few between-group differences were noted among comparisons of abstinence rates. Although consistent evidence suggested that any intervention was superior to inactive control, we found little evidence supporting a particular intervention over another. That said, the intervention with the best evidence for promoting abstinence from cannabis use is likely to be CBT or a MET + CBT combination intervention. Little consistent evidence indicated that intervention intensity with CM adjuncts would improve treatment outcomes in this regard. Notably, according to three studies reporting information regarding duration of abstinence achieved by participants, an average of one month was attained before initial relapse (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2012</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of cannabis dependence severity</HEADING>
<P>Evidence for an intervention effect on cannabis use disorder severity was limited by few studies investigating this outcome (13 studies). In summary, evidence suggests that an intervention including either or both of MET or CBT would likely show effectiveness in reducing the severity of cannabis dependence compared with minimal treatment controls. Those trials that included comparisons between two active interventions most often included MET + CBT treatments and found that better treatment outcomes were associated with the more intensive format and the somewhat consistent finding that including CM would improve outcomes further. The quality of the evidence for reductions in severity of dependence over the short term was considered low according to the GRADE assessment of quality, that is, the number of included studies was limited, one study had high risk of bias and heterogeneity in assessment measures (including numbers of symptoms and scales of symptom severity) was evident.</P>

In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Copeland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Copeland 2001</LINK> reported significantly improved outcomes in terms of dependence and related problems among treatment completers compared with non-completers for both six-session and single-session CBT interventions.

The sole exception was a 14-session MET + CBT trial, which was found to be superior in enhancing confidence to quit (as measured by the Situational Confidence Questionnaire) when compared with four-session MET at end of treatment (MD 25.10, 95% CI 9.79 to 40.41, one study, 31 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of motivation to quit</HEADING>
<P>Evidence for an effect of intervention on motivation to quit cannabis use was greatly limited by the few studies investigating this outcome (six studies). Given the lack of any particular intervention effectiveness over time, it is difficult to make treatment recommendations for improving motivation to quit without conducting further research. Notably, although it was not assessed as a treatment outcome, use of coping skills during treatment and self efficacy to quit post treatment were found to be significant predictors of other cannabis-related treatment outcomes in the <LINK REF="STD-MTPRG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MTPRG 2004</LINK> trial. Similarly, it was noteworthy that trials that did not include treatment-seeking participants (who could be assumed to be motivated to quit from baseline) but recruited from non-cannabis treatment settings reported particularly poor cannabis-related treatment outcomes, that is, three trials found no significant improvement over control at any follow-up point (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>); two trials reported limited improvement, which was non-significant by final follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2011</LINK>); and only one trial found improved treatment outcomes in groups receiving intensive treatments compared with less intensive control treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2012</LINK>). Finally, when motivation to abstain from cannabis was assessed as a potential mediator of treatment effect, some evidence suggested that motivation to quit at baseline may be an important indicator of overall treatment success (<LINK REF="STD-Litt-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Litt 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2011</LINK>), although other studies found no such association (<LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2007</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 23 studies, with a total of 4045 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. Several different treatment styles were examined, with the weight of evidence focusing on motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions. Although moderate evidence indicates that significant reductions in cannabis use frequency are likely in the short term (within six months), complete abstinence was not often attained. Moreover, treatment was not consistently effective in reducing cannabis-related problems or in addressing secondary outcomes such as other substance use and mental health concerns. Available evidence was most supportive of MET + CBT-based interventions of greater intensity and longer duration (more than four sessions, delivered over more than one month). It is likely that complementing these treatments with contingency management with vouchers presented for negative urine (CM-abs) will enhance effects on outcomes in the short term, but little evidence suggests that this addition would improve results over the long term (nine months onwards).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For comparison of any intervention versus inactive control, frequency of cannabis use was most consistently assessed by all included trials. Each trial reported a significant reduction in cannabis use, and moderate evidence indicates that those receiving any intervention reported fewer days of cannabis use compared with those given inactive control through four-month follow-up. In contrast, scant evidence indicates that just over one-third of intervention participants reported point-prevalence abstinence immediately post treatment, and that this proportion was reduced as the follow-up period increased to approximately one in four at final follow-up. Studies typically confirmed these abstinence rates by using bioanalysis (urine and hair samples). For those who achieved abstinence but relapsed later, the period of abstinence was reported to last approximately one month. In addition, scant evidence suggests that participants who received any intervention reported fewer symptoms of cannabis dependence and fewer cannabis-related problems compared with those given inactive control through four-month follow-up. Further, very little evidence suggested a treatment effect on the number of joints used per day of use when those receiving intervention reported fewer joints at up to approximately eight-month follow-up compared with those given inactive control. Little evidence was found on the effect of treatment over inactive control post eight-month follow-up. Heterogeneity in measurement of secondary outcomes prevented meta-analysis, but little evidence showed any treatment effect over inactive control conditions on motivation to quit cannabis use, non-cannabis substance use or mental health concerns. Finally, moderate evidence indicates that participants were likely to complete treatment as intended.</P>
<P>For any intervention versus treatment as usual, three included studies assessed intervention effect versus treatment as usual among patients at out-patient psychiatric clinics. Investigators found no evidence of between-group differences across these trials at final follow-up on any of the primary or secondary treatment outcomes included in this review.</P>
<P>For intervention versus intervention, studies made few direct comparisons between intervention types, but MET + CBT interventions were most consistently effective compared with alternative treatments with regards to reductions in cannabis use frequency and symptoms of dependence. Moreover, meta-analyses of primary outcomes found that MET + CBT interventions outperformed MET and CBT interventions delivered individually. Notably, two studies found that this type of intervention showed even greater effect on frequency of cannabis use when paired with CM-abs adjunct treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Budney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Budney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2006</LINK>). Finally, additional subgrouping showed that intensive interventions (more than four sessions or delivered over longer than one month) had greater treatment effect on each primary outcome compared with less intensive interventions. Little evidence was found to support one intervention over another with regards to all other investigated outcomes over the long term (particularly from nine-month follow-up onward).</P>
<P>In summary, despite an obvious need for future treatment comparisons that include greater focus on outcomes beyond frequency of cannabis use, available evidence shows the most consistent support for MET + CBT-based cannabis interventions with the adjunct of CM-abs when possible. Although it was not possible to determine an ideal number of sessions or treatment duration, evidence most consistently supported more intense and longer interventions over less intense and shorter counterparts. Given this finding, it is noteworthy that among experimental arms, an average of just six sessions was provided across trials, indicating that included interventions appear to favour brevity over intensity.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was limited by a small number of studies on similar treatment types showing great heterogeneity (preventing any meta-analysis), relatively few studies assessing treatment outcomes beyond six months and, finally, the fact that participants who were not frequent cannabis users were excluded from this review (thus, treatment trials for occasional users were excluded). In summary, review authors believe that this review update was produced through an unbiased process limited only by the adequacy of reporting in included studies. Despite reportedly successful delivery of each treatment in a research setting, the included studies suffered from serious limitations, which reduced the external validity of included treatment types and hampered recommendations of a particular treatment type. The most serious of these limitations are discussed here.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Although the range of included intervention types showed some breadth, MET- and CBT-based interventions were prevalent, and more modern treatment types such as mindfulness techniques or acceptance commitment therapy were largely absent.</LI>
<LI>Great heterogeneity across studies was evident in assessment procedures chosen and measures used to assess primary (most notably, cannabis-related problems) and secondary treatment outcomes (most notably, mental health concerns). Among the treatment outcomes noted in this review, only frequency of cannabis use and severity of cannabis use disorder shared relatively common measures across studies and were most impacted by treatment.</LI>
<LI>Included participants were typically white Caucasian males in their late twenties to early thirties. These features describe the typical cannabis treatment seeker, and the handful of trials that addressed this limitation reported no significant differences in treatment outcomes by gender or age. In contrast, the only study that addressed ethnicity when assessing treatment outcomes found that interventions including contingency management were significantly less effective among black than white participants, and that black participants were significantly less likely to complete all treatment sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2006</LINK>). Despite this, two separate trials, which included African American participants as the majority, found significant treatment effects on cannabis use over the long term (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carroll-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 2012</LINK>). The applicability of treatments to females, older adults and non-Caucasian individuals is less clear.</LI>
<LI>Although the sample size of individual treatment groups was adequate across trials (n = 64.2 on average), and although most participants completed treatment as intended, an important minority of sessions were not completed. Whether reported treatment outcomes reflect those receiving the full complement of treatment or simply most of the treatment remains unclear. Indeed, only one trial found a significant association between treatment completers and improved outcomes compared with non-completers. Future research is required to delineate the importance of treatment completion as compared with moderate to high attendance.</LI>
<LI>Only a handful of studies assessed participants' previous experience with cannabis treatment or previous attempts at quitting cannabis. Although it was unclear whether these studies directly investigated the impact of previous quit attempts, no study indicated that such experience had a significant impact on treatment outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Few included trials were conducted outside the USA, leaving the applicability of treatments to other cultures relatively unclear. On this basis, the external validity of included trials was rated as weak.</LI>
<LI>No study excluded participants on the basis of their use of tobacco, and only five studies assessed the status of tobacco use at baseline. Information on tobacco use during the trial period was provided by three studies; none found any intervention effect or change in tobacco use across follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Hoch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hoch 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kadden-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kadden 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roffman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roffman 1988</LINK>). No study provided specific information concerning how tobacco use was addressed during cannabis treatment. This lack of information on tobacco use is a matter of concern as outcomes of cannabis use treatment have been shown elsewhere to be significantly moderated by tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-Agrawal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agrawal 2012</LINK>).</LI>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, the validity of the included trials was very low to moderate. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes of cannabis use frequency and quantity and cannabis-related problems was typically impacted by lack of assessment of non-cannabis substance use or by use of additional treatments before or during the trial period. Across trials, performance and detection bias was a matter of concern, as participant blinding was not possible and researcher blinding was often left unclear or not reported. With the exception of assessment of dependence severity, data conversions were necessary to standardise outcome assessments. Also, with the exception of days of cannabis use, conversion to standardised mean differences was required for each of the primary outcomes because heterogeneity was noted in the measures used.</P>
<P>Notably, the few trials that assessed tobacco smoking found that smoking was prevalent but did not prevent a significant intervention effect on cannabis use frequency. Further, among the few trials that assessed use of additional treatments, the prevalence of accessing additional treatments during the trial period was found to be low. In addition, no trial was at high risk of selection bias because investigators used appropriate randomisation and participant allocation procedures. Similarly, it was common for the included studies to address trial drop-out by providing appropriate analyses and plans and reporting all pre-specified treatment outcomes, and no trial had high risk of attrition and reporting bias. Finally, the included trials recruited a large number of participants (total of n = 4045) and provided excellent training and supervision of therapists to ensure treatment fidelity.</P>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three relevant previous systematic reviews of cannabis treatments have been conducted, although one focused on prevention programmes specifically targeting adolescent cannabis use within schools as opposed to intervention programs (<LINK REF="REF-Tobler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobler 1999</LINK>). The two remaining reviews examined community-delivered treatments for adolescent cannabis users (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 2011</LINK>) and psychosocial interventions for individuals who were actively seeking treatment (excluding non-treatment seekers with problematic use; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2014</LINK>). Treatments with best evidence for adolescent cannabis users included family members, such as multi-dimensional family therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 2011</LINK>). In this meta-analytical review, MET-based interventions were comparable with family-oriented interventions, and each had moderate treatment effects that waned after 12-month follow-up. Consistent with these results, the current review highlighted support for MET interventions but did not include family-based interventions. Further, outcomes were seen to wane over time but perhaps earlier at post six- to nine-month follow-up. In the remaining review, behavioural therapies (including MET, CBT and CM) were found to be more effective over inactive control among adult treatment seekers, but review authors found no significant differences in treatment intensityand noted that only approximately one in two participants achieved abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2014</LINK>). Consistent with these results, the weight of evidence in the current review supports MET + CBT-based interventions, and at treatment end, abstinence rates were comparably low, with an average of just over one in three participants achieving abstinence. In contrast, the current review identified consistency in studies that compared treatments of differing intensity and showed greater support for more intense treatments.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention have been raised and partially resolved. The generalisability of findings is unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and the homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable but was comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention, when compared with minimal treatment controls, was found to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least over the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention of more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence-based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder.</P>
<P>In addition, studies that assessed the impact of combining CM-abs treatment with CBT-based or MET + CBT-based interventions suggest that this may enhance outcomes during treatment (although these improvements tend to wane during assessments after treatment).</P>
<P>Studies that included MET or CBT treatments consistently recommended use of MET, particularly for individuals with low motivation who are just beginning treatment (MET + CBT interventions typically focus first sessions on MET and move into CBT), and CBT for those more established in treatment with greater motivation to abstain from use. The three studies that included participants with severe psychiatric conditions did not report significant improvement in primary or secondary treatment outcomes at final follow-up. Thus, cannabis treatment combined with treatment as usual may not be essential, although future research is warranted to confirm this.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-28 12:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Response rates, particularly regarding abstinence from cannabis and reduction in cannabis-related problems, leave much room for improvement. Studies comparing different therapeutic modalities raise important questions about optimal duration, intensity and type of treatment. Generalisability of findings is also unknown, as the included studies were conducted at a limited number of localities and with fairly homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. Future studies should address longer-term outcomes and should assess cannabis use and related problems by using consistent measures while better assessing other substance use (type of substance use, frequency, quantity) and the mental health of participants. To enhance consistency in outcome measurement, we suggest that future studies assess each of the primary outcomes discussed in this review, with cannabis use frequency assessed across at least a one-month period, quantity assessed by joints per day across one week or longer, severity of dependence assessed via assessment of the number of dependence symptoms and a scale such as the Addiction Severity Index (<LINK REF="REF-McLellan-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLellan 1980</LINK>) or Severity of Dependence Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Swift-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swift 1998</LINK>) and cannabis-related problems evaluated on a scale such as the Marijuana Problems Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Stephens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stephens 2000</LINK>) or the Cannabis Problems Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Copeland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 2005</LINK>). Additional analyses of therapy session processes in relation to outcomes may shed some light on important aspects of the interventions. To assist with this, future studies could consider dismantling designs in which hypothesised active components of the interventions are offered individually or in specific combinations and are compared with appropriate attention-placebo controls. At the time of this review, no proven medications are available for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2014</LINK>), but this is an emerging field, and future studies should explore whether a desirable synergistic effect is evident between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy combinations. No included study provided specific information on how concurrent tobacco use should be treated, and this raises an important topic for future research. The question of best treatment for those with concomitant tobacco dependence remains unanswered. With current changes to cannabis legislation throughout the world, particularly in the United States, future research including patients from settings where cannabis is legal will allow comparisons to determine whether any consequences of cannabis use are related more to the illegal status of the drug than to the substance per se. Finally, as no included study that recruited participants from healthcare settings who were not initially seeking cannabis treatment found any significant long-term effects of treatment, further study is required before treatment recommendations can be made for this group.</P>

We obtained all potentially eligible studies as full-text articles, and two review authors independently assessed them for inclusion. In doubtful or controversial cases, review authors discussed all identified discrepancies and reached consensus on all items. Jan Copeland, Linda Gowing and Bernard Le Foll offered guidance regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria and provided comments on and changes to draft manuscripts.</P>

<P>Participants reported first using cannabis regularly at an average age of 18 years (18.9, 17.7, 18.6). At baseline, participants reported using cannabis almost daily (average 74.8, 74.8 and 76.8 of the past 90 days) and smoked on average 3 joints (3.3, 3.1, 3.3). Participants reported on average 6 problems (6.4, 5.3, 6.3) on the Stephens Problem Scale and on average 3 symptoms of cannabis dependence (3.9, 3.3, 3.2). Most participants reported that they were in pre-contemplation or contemplation stages of quitting use (68%, 87%, 70%)</P>

<P>Previous cannabis treatments were not assessed (although treatments during the trial period were assessed and concurrent treatment was excluded). The proportion reporting a motivation to change was significantly different between groups at baseline but was included as a co-variate in analysis. At follow-up, participants in Group 2 who did not attend follow-up at 6 and 12 months reported fewer marijuana-related problems at baseline than those who did attend. Participants in Group 3 who did not attend 7-week follow-up reported more baseline marijuana dependence symptoms compared with those who did attend, and participants in Group 1 who did not attend the 12-month follow-up reported fewer baseline marijuana dependence symptoms than those who did attend. "Therefore, the baseline measures of marijuana - problems and dependence symptoms - were also included as covariates in all analyses, and multiple approaches to handling missing data were used to assess the robustness of findings".
