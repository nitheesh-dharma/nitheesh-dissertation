<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder affecting approximately 250 million people worldwide. Sickle-shaped red blood cells which are characteristic of sickle cell disease may block blood vessels causing pain, tissue death and even severe damage in the major organs. Similar blockages in the blood vessels of the lungs can lead to lung injury and a complication known as acute chest syndrome which occurs in approximately 30% of people with sickle cell disease. Common symptoms include fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath; some of which can be l<B>i</B>fe-threatening. Treatment is mainly supportive and given when an individual experiences symptoms and may include antibiotics, drugs to help prevent the clotting of blood and other conventional treatments. Interest has been shown recently in inhaling nitric oxide, a soluble gas. This gas is known to play a role in expanding blood vessels and clumping platelets, to relieve some of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome. It is also used for treatment in similar conditions, namely pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs) in babies up to four weeks old. The authors of the review did not find any trials showing how effective inhaled nitric oxide is for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. The authors concluded that future research should provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether nitric oxide is effective.<B>

<P>Acute chest syndrome has been defined as a new infiltrate visible on chest radiograph associated with one or more symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum production, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, or new-onset hypoxia. Symptoms and complications of this syndrome, whether of infectious or non-infectious origin, vary quite widely in people with sickle cell disease. Lung infection tends to predominate in children, whilst infarction appears more common in adults. However, these are often interrelated and may occur concurrently. The differences in clinical course and severity are suggestive of multiple causes for acute chest syndrome. Successful treatment depends principally on high-quality supportive care. The syndrome and its treatment have been extensively studied, but the response to antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other conventional therapies remains disappointing. The potential of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment option has more recently provoked considerable interest. Nitric oxide appears to play a major role in both the regulation of vascular muscle tone at the cellular level and in platelet aggregation (clumping). Much of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease is consistent with a mechanism of nitric oxide depletion and although there has been extensive research on the pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome, the possible therapeutic role of inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease is still to be determined.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-22 12:43:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology and prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition and one of the most prevalent genetic diseases worldwide. It is particularly common in Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America, Saudi Arabia, India and a number of Mediterranean countries (<LINK REF="REF-Alvim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loureiro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loureiro 2005</LINK>). In the USA the disease affects around 72,000 people and occurs at a rate of 1 in every 500 African-American and 1 in every 1000 to 1400 Hispanic-American births (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Abnormal haemoglobin genes are responsible for the different forms of the disease. These include homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease in which the sickle haemoglobin (HbS) gene is inherited from both parents; sickle cell-haemoglobin C (SC) disease in which the genes for HbS and HbC are inherited; and two further types resulting from the interaction of HbS genes with those for beta thalassaemia; sickle cell/ß<SUP>o</SUP> -thalassaemia and sickle cell/ß<SUP>+</SUP> thalassaemia (Sß0 and Sß<SUP>+</SUP>). Homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and sickle cell/ß<SUP>o</SUP> -thalassaemia are generally considered the more severe forms of the disease whilst (SC) disease and sickle cell/ß+ thalassaemia tend to be milder.</P>
<P>The main clinical features result from the tendency of HbS molecules to polymerise, leading to a reduced pliability of the red blood cells which are then prematurely broken down and eventually cause blockages and reduced flow in some of the blood vessels (vaso-occlusion). Some of the potentially serious complications in SCD are: chronic haemolytic anaemia; increased susceptibility to infections; recurrent episodes of pain; an increased risk of stroke; and multiple organ dysfunction. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell anaemia, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in SCD from the age of two years (<LINK REF="REF-Vichinsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vichinsky 2000</LINK>). Data from the 'Clinical Course of Sickle Cell Disease Cooperative Study' indicate that this complication occurs with an incidence of 10,500 per 100,000 patients per year (<LINK REF="REF-Castro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castro 1994</LINK>). Acute chest syndrome has been defined as a new infiltrate visible on chest radiograph associated with one or more symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum production, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, or new-onset hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Vichinsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vichinsky 2000</LINK>). Complications occurring in the lungs include infection, infarction (death of tissue due to blockage of the blood vessels by blood clots or bone marrow fat) and acute pulmonary sequestration. Recurrent attacks of ACS may also result in pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and right-sided heart failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical features and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Symptoms and complications of ACS may vary quite widely between individuals with SCD. Clinical features may include: new infiltrate visible on chest X-ray; fever; cough; sputum production; chest pain and respiratory symptoms e.g. dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or hypoxia (poor oxygenation). Infection in the lungs tends to predominate in children whilst infarction appears to be more common in adults, but these two are often interrelated and may occur concurrently (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Rates of infection have been reported as: chlamydia 7.2%; mycoplasma 6.6%; viruses 6.4% and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>, 4.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Vichinsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vichinsky 2000</LINK>). Bacterial pneumonia has also been reported in up to 40% of cases with ACS (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1984</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The syndrome has been extensively studied but the responses to: antibiotics, as found in a recent Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed__x002d_Carvajal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martí-Carvajal 2008</LINK>); anticoagulants; and other conventional therapies remain disappointing. Against this background, the advent of inhaled nitric oxide (inhNO) as a potential treatment option has gained considerable interest. The effect of nitric oxide on red blood cells in vitro and inhNO in a number of volunteers with sickle cell anemia has previously been investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Head-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Head 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nitric oxide has several mechanisms of action, but it appears to play a major role in both the regulation of vascular muscle tone at the cellular level as well as in platelet aggregation (clumping) (<LINK REF="REF-Gladwin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladwin 1999</LINK>). In SCD, especially SS disease, the rapid release of cell-free haemoglobin may exceed the normal clearance mechanisms such as by binding to haptoglobin, and thus the excess free haemoglobin consumes nitric oxide and impairs its regulatory role (<LINK REF="REF-Rother-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rother 2005</LINK>). It is perceived that the restoration of nitric oxide levels, which may be most readily achieved by inhalation, may return abnormal vascular tone towards normal. Preliminary studies have shown that inhNO can be effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension in neonates by improving oxygenation and reducing inflammation and pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Atz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atz 1997</LINK>). It has been suggested that its use in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may lend support to its use in ACS (<LINK REF="REF-Gerlach-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlach 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Much of the pathophysiology of SCD is consistent with a mechanism of nitric oxide depletion. Although there has been extensive research on the pathophysiology of ACS (<LINK REF="REF-Rossaint-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossaint 1993</LINK>), the role of inhNO in ACS (one of the most serious complications of SCD) raises the possibility of new therapies for sickle cell anaemia based on nitric oxide.</P>

<P>We will assess the statistical homogeneity using a chi-squared test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, where I<SUP>2</SUP> values over 50% indicate moderate to high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>If we identify a sufficient number of RCTs, we will attempt to assess publication bias using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). If we detect asymmetry in the funnel plot, then we will investigate other possible causes.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Nine references to studies were initially identified, but on inspection of the title and abstract none met our inclusion criteria. All were subsequently excluded from further analysis. </P>
<P>Our searches of several clinical trials registers did reveal two ongoing multicenter trials investigating the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in SCD, but both focused on vaso-occlusive pain crises. No studies can be included in this review at this time.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Whilst preliminary studies have shown that inhNO can be effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Atz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atz 1997</LINK>), and its use in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Gerlach-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlach 1993</LINK>) may be supportive of its use in ACS, we were unsuccessful in finding relevant trials to clarify the role of inhNO in ACS. The need for a therapeutic trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of inhNO in people with ACS was suggested several years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Gladwin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladwin 1999</LINK>). The absence of this form of high level evidence may in part reflect some of the complexities associated with conducting a trial, where the aetiology of the condition (ACS) is not clearly understood. In addition there are significant ethical issues to be faced in withholding life-saving treatment or offering a placebo in such a trial. </P>
<P>This review illustrates that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of inhNO in the management of ACS in people with SCD. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the current information we cannot recommend in favour of, or against the use of inhNO for treating ACS in people with SCD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The absence of evidence exemplified by the lack of studies in this systematic review highlights the importance of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for the relief of at least some of the symptoms, e.g. pain in ACS. Therefore, well-designed, randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of inhNO in people with SCD.<B>
