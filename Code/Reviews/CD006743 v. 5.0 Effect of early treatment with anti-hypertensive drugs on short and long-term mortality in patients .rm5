<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-04 00:54:31 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Marco I Perez">
<P>Reducing blood pressure with drugs has been a strategy used in patients suffering from an acute event in the heart or in the brain, such as heart attack or stroke. There is controversy whether these drugs should be used in the immediate period of these events, and what would be the best type of drug that renders the most benefit. This review looked at all studies where patients were randomized to one of these drugs or placebo, in this period. One class of blood pressure lowering drug, the so-called nitrates, demonstrated reduction in mortality in patients with heart attack. For 1000 patients treated 4 to 8 deaths were prevented during the first 2 days of this acute event. The ACE-inhibitors class also decrease mortality when continued for 10 days (3 to 5 deaths prevented per 1000). No other class of drug showed a reduction in mortality.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:11:21 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Sixty-five RCTs (N=166,206) were included, evaluating four classes of anti-hypertensive drugs: ACE inhibitors (12 trials), beta-blockers (20), calcium channel blockers (18) and nitrates (18). Acute stroke was studied in 6 trials (all involving CCBs). Acute myocardial infarction was studied in 59 trials. In the latter setting immediate nitrate treatment (within 24 hours) reduced all-cause mortality during the first 2 days (RR 0.81, 95%CI [0.74,0.89], p&lt;0.0001). No further benefit was observed with nitrate therapy beyond this point. ACE inhibitors did not reduce mortality at 2 days (RR 0.91,95%CI [0.82, 1.00]), but did after 10 days (RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.87,0.98] p=0.01). No other blood pressure lowering drug administered as an immediate treatment or short-term treatment produced a statistical significant mortality reduction at 2, 10 or &#8805;30 days. There was not enough data studying acute stroke, and there were no RCTs evaluating other acute cardiovascular events.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-26 15:48:29 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Marco I Perez">
<P>Nitrates reduce mortality (4-8 deaths prevented per 1000) at 2 days when administered within 24 hours of symptom onset of an acute myocardial infarction. No mortality benefit was seen when treatment continued beyond 48 hours. Mortality benefit of immediate treatment with ACE inhibitors post MI at 2 days did not reach statistical significance but the effect was significant at 10 days (3-5 deaths prevented per 1000). There is good evidence for lack of a mortality benefit with immediate or short-term treatment with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers for acute myocardial infarction.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Acute cardiovascular events represent a significant therapeutic challenge as they are the number one cause of hospitalizations in many countries including Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Canada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Canada 2003</LINK>). A wide range of pharmacological interventions administered for these conditions have been studied in great detail worldwide. However, some questions remain unanswered. For instance, it is not known whether blood pressure lowering drugs given in the early phase of these events is beneficial or harmful. The best time for initiation of treatment with these drugs is also not known, although most clinical guidelines recommend starting treatment within 24 hours of the onset. For example, the <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK> recommend to "start the administration of ACE inhibitors within the first 24 hours of an acute myocardial infarction" . In the setting of an acute cardiovascular event, in general, most of the time blood pressure is not elevated and sometimes it is low. Thus, the rationale for the early administration of blood pressure lowering drug is not completely clear. The objective<B> </B>of this review is to find randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the use of blood pressure lowering drugs in this early phase of an acute CVE.</P>
<P>An acute cardiovascular event is a sudden manifestation of a cardiovascular disease (e.g. myocardial infarction or stroke). According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Acute cardiovascular events include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), acute stroke, acute aortic dissection, and left-ventricular failure with acute pulmonary edema. Although these could be considered different clinical entities they share one thing in common; they are life-threatening and have a high rate of initial mortality if left untreated. For example, epidemiological studies from the 1960's showed that 75% of patients died within 24 hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Fulton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulton 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>The best way to understand the rationale for this review is to consider another well studied intervention, fibrinolysis which is administered in the early phase of an acute myocardial infarction or stroke. Consider the example of a large RCT (<LINK REF="REF-ISIS_x002d_2-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISIS-2 1988</LINK>) where 17,187 patients within 24 hours of the onset of a suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive one-hour streptokinase IV infusion or placebo. The patients were followed for 35 days and relative mortality between the two groups was measured over time. By inspecting the survival curves it was possible to determine that 75% of the deaths in the placebo group, occurred during the first 10 days. Streptokinase had no effect on mortality at 48 hours (RR=1.04, 95%CI[0.89,1.21]), but reduced mortality at 10 days (RR= 0.82, 95%CI[0.74,0.91]) and at 35 days (RR=0.77, 95%CI[0.70,0.84]). From this it can be deduced that this immediate and short treatment had a beneficial effect, but this was only manifest when measured at 10 days and 35 days.</P>
<P>This trial, thus, represents the ideal design we are looking for in this review where an<B> early (within 24 hours) antihypertensive intervention</B> is given for a short time (up to 48 hours) to patients with an acute cardiovascular event, and the key outcomes are reported at 48 hours, 10 days and &#8805;30 days. We have chosen these times as it has been emphasized that when the severity of a disease changes quickly over time, the follow-up periods need to be subdivided into an early period, an intermediate period and a late period (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1977</LINK>). In addition to this ideal trial design, we have also studied and analyzed trials in which the intervention was started within 24 hours and continued for up to 10 days. We refer to the 1 to 48 hour intervention as "immediate" and the intervention started within 24 hours and continued up to 10 days as "short-term".</P>
<P>For trials where the experimental treatment and control was continued more than 10 days we limited our analysis to the 2 day and 10 day mortality. Most patients are stable after 10 days and drug effects occurring after the acute period are not within the purview of this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:24:55 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Anti-hypertensive or blood pressure lowering drugs are defined as those pharmacological agents indicated and used to treat elevated blood pressure or hypertension. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) / International Society of Hypertension (ISH) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_ISH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/ISH 2003</LINK>) and other international guideline committees (<LINK REF="REF-ESH_x002d_ESC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH-ESC 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BHS_x002d_IV_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHS-IV, 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-JNC_x002d_7_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC-7, 2003</LINK>) these include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (<B>ACE-I</B>), angiotensin II receptor blockers (<B>ARBs</B>), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (<B>BB</B>), calcium channel blockers (<B>CCB</B>), diuretics and nitrates (including nitroprusside).</P>
<P>It is important to emphasize that anti-hypertensive drugs have the potential to cause pharmacological actions other than lowering BP (for example, reducing heart rate) when administered to humans, which makes them usable for indications other than treating hypertension. In contrast, there are drugs that have the potential to reduce blood pressure (for example: morphine in certain dose and setting) but are not classified as anti-hypertensive drugs. The latter type of drugs are not considered in this review.</P>
<P>Anti-hypertensive drugs are commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Jackevicius-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackevicius 2005</LINK>) and recommended in the early phase of an acute cardiovascular event. The most common anti-hypertensive drugs that are recommended are <B>ACEI</B> for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>), (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC, 2003</LINK>) and for unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2007</LINK>); <B>BB</B> for AMI (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC, 2003</LINK>), for UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2007</LINK>) and for stroke (hypertensive) (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002f_ASA_x002c_-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA/ASA, 2005</LINK>), <B>CCB</B> for AMI (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>) and for Stroke (hypertensive) (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002f_ASA_x002c_-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA/ASA, 2005</LINK>), <B>diuretics </B>for AMI/APE (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>), and <B>nitrates</B> for AMI (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC, 2003</LINK>), for UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2007</LINK>) and for Stroke (hypertensive) (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002f_ASA_x002c_-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA/ASA, 2005</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:25:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The exact mechanism of action of blood pressure lowering drugs, antihypertensives, is often not known with certainty, but each of the different classes of drugs act at different sites and by different mechanisms.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)</U>
</I>
</P>
<P>ACE-I inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I, a relatively inactive peptide, to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and causes release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. The ACE-I probably lower blood pressure by reducing the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</U>
</I>
</P>
<P>ARBs inhibit the binding and action of angiotensin II at the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is the site of action to cause vasoconstriction and release of aldosterone. They, thus, also probably reduce BP by blocking the BP increasing effects of angiotensin II.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BB) </U>
</I>
</P>
<P>In general beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs or beta-blockers (BB) are drugs that competitively inhibit the effect of the catecholamines, noradrenaline and adrenaline, on beta-adrenergic receptors. There are subtypes of beta-blockers depending on their relative affinity for B1 and B2 receptors, partial agonist activity, and ability to also block alpha-adrenergic receptors. Catecholamines have a positive chronotropic and inotropic actions on the heart, can cause vasoconstriction or vasodilatation of blood vessels and stimulate renin release from the kidney. Thus, BB drugs could lower BP by a number of these differing effects. The exact mechanism by which beta-blockers lower BP in humans is not known.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Calcium channel blockers (CCB) </U>
</I>
</P>
<P>Calcium channel blockers reduce the cytosolic free-calcium concentrations by blocking transmembrane calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. Dihydropyridines (such as nifedipine), benzothiazepines (diltiazem) and phenylalkylamines (verapamil) bind to the pore-containing the &#945;1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel. In general, calcium channel blockers relax arteriolar smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilatation and decreased peripheral resistance.  The decreased systemic resistance is thought to cause the blood pressure reduction. Agents that slow the rate of recovery of L-type calcium channels (verapamil, diltiazem) have negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects on the heart's conducting system. The CCBs also have a natriuretic effect on the kidney that may contribute to their ability to lower blood pressure.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Diuretics</U>
</I>
</P>
<P>Thiazide diuretics inhibit the Na<SUP>+</SUP>Cl<SUP>-</SUP> co-transporter in the proximal part of the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. This decreases tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and increases urinary excretion of sodium and water .</P>
<P>Furosemide and other loop diuretics inhibit sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of loop of Henle as well as in both proximal and distal tubules.</P>
<P>The mechanism by which diuretics lower blood pressure has not been established.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Nitrates (including nitroprusside) </U>
</I>
</P>
<P>Organic nitrates and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are nitric oxide (NO) donors. Organic nitrates, such as glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerine) require enzymatic metabolism to generate NO. In contrast SNP spontaneously generate this NO. There are a number of theories about how nitrates cause vasodilation: 1) acting on specific nitrate receptor (containing a sulfhydryl group-SH), 2) NO exerts a potassium channel activation (hyperpolarizing the cell membrane) and 3) NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase increasing cGMP levels, which in turn inhibits Ca<SUP>+</SUP> entry into smooth muscle cells and increases Ca<SUP>+</SUP> uptake by the smooth endoplasmic reticulum resulting in vascular smooth muscle relaxation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:36:29 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>First, to determine whether blood pressure lowering by all classes of blood pressure lowering drugs during the early phase of an acute cardiovascular event affects mortality and morbidity.</P>
<P>It is important to appreciate that during the first hours after an acute cardiovascular event, complex hemodynamic changes are occurring, making the organs involved especially vulnerable to local and systemic changes. Blood pressure reduction during this time could be beneficial, but could equally likely be detrimental.</P>
<P>Recently, thanks to the advances in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in some acute cardiovascular events (such as the thrombotic occlusion at the site of atherosclerotic plaques in AMI) different pharmacological interventions have been implemented and proven beneficial. For example, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence has demonstrated a reduction in mortality with the use of thrombolytic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-FTT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">FTT 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Boersma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boersma 1996</LINK>) and anti-platelet drugs (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>) in acute AMI. There is also RCT evidence for benefit with the use of antiplatelet drugs in the acute treatment of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). The benefits of these pharmacological therapies have been claimed to be greater when they are administrated in the <B>early </B>phase (for example: thrombolysis within 6 hours) of the onset of the acute cardiovascular event. Thus, the time of the administration can be an important determinant as to whether an intervention is beneficial or harmful in patients with an acute cardiovascular event.</P>
<P>The rationale for administering blood pressure lowering drugs in the early phase of an acute cardiovascular event is less well understood. In acute cardiovascular events associated with marked elevation of blood pressure (defined as <B>hypertensive emergencies</B> by <LINK REF="REF-JNC_x002d_7_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC-7, 2003</LINK>) blood pressure lowering makes some pathophysiological sense as if the elevated blood pressure is causing organ damage, reducing blood pressure is likely to be beneficial. However, there is no RCT evidence to demonstrate mortality and morbidity benefits of the use of blood pressure lowering drugs in hypertensive emergencies (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This lack of evidence for situations where blood pressure is elevated emphasizes the importance of attempting to assess the benefits and harms in acute cardiovascular events in general. In the setting of acute cardiovascular event in general most of the time blood pressure is not elevated and sometimes it is low. </P>
<P>We have deliberately chosen outcomes in this review that are a measure of both benefit and harm in order to avoid selective reporting bias. Due to the standardized definition of serious adverse events (SAE), i.e. any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002f_FDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH/FDA 1995</LINK>), measuring total people with at least one serious adverse event would provide a very close estimate of the net health effect (benefit minus harm) of an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2002</LINK>). However, in acute, critically-ill hospitalized patient settings measuring SAE could be problematic and/or impractical. The main reason for this is because the physician must make a judgment as to whether an event led to prolongation of hospitalization. Therefore, in these acute clinical settings total all-cause mortality, a subgroup of total SAEs, is the best measure of net health effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2008</LINK>). All-cause mortality is an outcome measure that is not subject to physician judgment and which is usually reported in trials. It is easy to appreciate that an intervention that decreases mortality as compared to placebo is beneficial, while an intervention that increases mortality compared to placebo is harmful. Thus, we have chosen all-cause mortality as our primary outcome and total non-fatal serious adverse event as one of our secondary outcomes anticipating that trials might not consistently report this outcome. </P>
<P>Secondly to determine whether blood pressure lowering by the different subclasses of blood pressure lowering drugs during the early phase of an acute cardiovascular event affects mortality and morbidity. This question can be answered by performing a subgroup analysis where the effect of the drugs in the different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs are analyzed separately and compared with each other.</P>
<P>There are other published systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials dealing with antihypertensive drugs for acute cardiovascular events (specifically for acute myocardial infarction or stroke). For acute myocardial infarction reviews have been published for each different class of anti-hypertensive drug: CCB (<LINK REF="REF-Held-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Held 1989</LINK>); BB (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>); nitrates (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1988</LINK>), and ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-AMICG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMICG 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>). In addition there are three published systematic reviews dealing with acute stroke: CCB (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2000</LINK>), nitrates (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2002</LINK>), and diverse interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>These systematic reviews all have significant drawbacks and none were designed to assess the specific objective of this review. Some were <U>not limited</U> to immediate treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Reesi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Reesi 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-AMICG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMICG 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Held-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Held 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>) and included trials where the treatment started days after the onset of the acute cardiovascular event. One review mixed trials with control group (no treatment or placebo) with trials that have an active comparator as control (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1988</LINK>). Except for <LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2008</LINK>, all these reviews are also limited by not being up-to-date.</P>
<P>This is the first systematic review with the objective to assess the effects of all blood pressure lowering drugs administered as immediate treatment (starting within 24 hours) in patients with an acute cardiovascular event, on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure outcomes.</P>

<B>Analyses:<BR/>
</B>For the analysis of the data, Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5, was used.<BR/>Quantitative analyses of outcomes were based on intention-to-treat principles as much as possible. We used weighted mean difference to combine continuous variables and and expressed relative and absolute risk difference (with 95% confidence interval) for dichotomous outcomes to accept significant differences. Pooled risk differences obtained from a DerSimonian-Laird fixed effect model were converted to numbers needed to treat (NNTs) where appropriate.<BR/>Heterogeneity between trial results was tested using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic where percentages greater than 50% were taken to indicate significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The effects of immediate treatment with antihypertensive drugs on 2 day, 10 day and &#8805;30 day <B>mortality</B> in patients with an acute cardiovascular event were explored.

For example, for our day 10 mortality measure we included the cumulative incidence from time of randomization to day 10 inclusive (or at discharge from hospital when trial did not report the time - the assumption here is that the average hospitalization is about 7-10 days).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the impact of the design of the trial, double-blind vs. open label trials.

<P>Non-fatal serious adverse events (NF-SAEs) were included only if they were reported as total<B>,</B> not as individual non-fatal SAE.

<P>Data for blood pressure and heart rate were combined using a weighted mean difference method, whereby the trials are weighted according to the number of subjects in the trial and the within-study variance.

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:46:08 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Sixty-five randomized controlled trials (N=166,206) were found that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of those, 40 (60%) were double-blind placebo-controlled trials, involving 75% (N=125,487) of the entire studied population (See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). All included trials reported mortality for at least one of the time points of interest and none of the trials reported the total number of non-fatal serious adverse events. The largest trial included 58,050 patients (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>). Twenty one trials studied immediate treatment and 44 trials studied short-term treatment. The duration of treatment was for more than 10 days in 27/65 trials. We were able to extract short-term mortality (at day 10) in 62 trials. Four classes of blood pressure lowering drugs were evaluated: ACE inhibitors (12 trials), B-blockers (20 trials), Calcium channel blockers (18 trials) and nitrates, including nitroprusside (18 trials). The included trials studied patients with only 2 types of cardiovascular events: acute myocardial infarction (59 trials) and stroke (6 trials).</P>
<P>All included trials enrolled their patients within 24 hours<B> </B>of the onset of an acute cardiovascular event (CVE). In this review , we have assumed that enrollment, randomization and administration of the study drug occurred simultaneously. The details of the process involved was not described in any of the trial reports. The objective for accepting these types of trials was to evaluate the effects of early anti-hypertensive treatment in an acute setting. In the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) trials the average time of initiation of the study drug was 6.35 ± 4.74 hours after the onset. No stroke trial reported time of starting treatment. However, the included AMI studies scheduled their randomization 5 hours earlier than the stroke studies (12.6 ± 7.8 and 17 ± 8, respectively). We did find trials dealing with acute pulmonary edema and acute aortic dissection where patients were randomized within 24 hours. However, these trials had to be excluded for different reasons (see below excluded studies).</P>
<P>High blood pressure at baseline was not part of the inclusion criteria in any of 65 included trials. However, most of the trials explicitly stated that patients had to be free from shock or had a minimum BP (in general SBP of 90-110 mmHg and/or DBP of 50-60 mmHg) to enter the trial. For the included trials the overall weighted mean blood pressure at baseline was 133/82.2 mmHg for those randomized to an active drug and 133/ 82.7 mmHg for those randomized to the placebo or no treatment group. One quarter of patients were female and the overall weighted mean age was 60.85 years (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 22 trials in which we requested additional information, only 4 trialists responded to our request and provided additional information.</P>
<P>Blood pressure changes during the first 24 hours of treatment was reported in 19 trials (N=3,261). However, none of the trials reported on standard deviation of the change. Thus, this measure of variability was imputed from: the end point standard deviation (second-choice in our pre-specified hierarchy) in 14 trials; from the baseline value (third-choice) in 1 trial; and from the weighted mean standard deviation at end point (last-choice) in 4 trials.</P>
</INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR>
<EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:53:12 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We excluded 70 trials. Although these trials could have been excluded for one or more reasons, the main one is listed below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Mortality not reported or not reported in a form or time period that we could use: 47 trials</LI>
<LI>Uncertain time of patient inclusion following the acute event: 18 trials</LI>
<LI>Follow-up of less than 24 hours: 5 trials</LI>
</OL>
<P>Forty-seven trials were excluded due to lack of mortality data or mortality data that were not reported in a form or time period that we could use. There were three sub-types: <B>A)</B> Not reporting mortality at all, in either original, additional publications or after being requested to provide such data (18 trials). <B>B)</B> Reporting mortality but not according to our pre-specified time-frame (22 trials); or reporting it in an abstract but not confirmed by additional publications or after being requested it (2 trials) ; <B>C)</B> Reporting mortality but not based on intention to treat (ITT) principles (7 trials). An example of the latter sub-category is the multicenter double-blind trial <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1988</LINK>. Mortality rate was reported as 7/106 in the nifedipine group and 7/120 in the placebo group. After detailed reading of Walker's original and additional publications, it was found that the actual number of randomized patients was 217 in each group. Thus, the investigators failed to report mortality in approximately 50% of the randomized patients. If the information of this trial was included in our review, it would be misleading as this population represents a selected sub-group of patients. Other trials that fell into this category were <LINK REF="STD-Eveson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eveson 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Szczechowski-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Szczechowski 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DAVIT-I-1984" TYPE="STUDY">DAVIT I 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-HINT-1986" TYPE="STUDY">HINT 1986</LINK> , <LINK REF="STD-Barber-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Balcon-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Balcon 1966</LINK>.</P>
<P>Our justification for excluding those trials which had an uncertain time of patient inclusion following the acute event was to avoid having a heterogenous population that could lead to erroneous conclusions. The uncertain time inclusion applies to those trials that failed to explicitly state a specific time for inclusion; or trials that included their patients "on admission" or "immediately after admission". We believe this was too imprecise for determining the exact time that had elapsed from symptom onset to the inclusion of the patient and therefore to the initiation of therapy. It is possible that some patients could have had a delayed admission (symptoms began &gt;24 hours). This also would likely bias for survivors. In addition, having a delayed admission was more common in trials conducted before 1980-90's when infrastructure for emergency response to assist patients with acute cardiovascular event was not as uniformly developed as it is today. An illustrative example for this category of excluded trials is that of a double-blind trial where patients were to be included "immediately after admission" in 16 Danish centres (<LINK REF="STD-DAVIT-I-1984" TYPE="STUDY">DAVIT I 1984</LINK>). It was determined that the treatment was started after 24 hours in &gt;15% of patients with AMI; and mortality data was not reported separately for these patients.</P>
<P>Therefore, data from 65 trials (those excluded due to uncertain timing and those due to improper or non-extractable mortality data) out of 70 excluded trials could potentially be added to our review. Of these 65 excluded trials, <B>14</B> involved an ACE inhibitor (N=4,407); <B>21</B> trials involved a Beta-adrenergic Blocker (N=2,524); <B>20</B> trials involved CCBs (N=10,958);and <B>8</B> trials involved a nitrate (N=1,475). If these excluded patients were added to the included patients it would have only a small impact on the ACE inhibitor data (increase by 5.2%), BB data (increase by 3.5%), and nitrate data (increase by 1.7%). However, it could have a large impact on the calcium channel blocker data (increase ~600%, from 2,141 to 13,099). There were <B>3/</B>65 studies (N=126) that involved other classes of blood pressure lowering drugs: 2 trials for the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin (<LINK REF="STD-Kolettis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kolettis 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murdock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Murdock 1990</LINK>) and one trial for the alpha-2 centrally acting agonist, clonidine (<LINK REF="STD-Manolis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Manolis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of 70 excluded studies, 52 trials involved patients with AMI, 9 trials included patients with acute stroke, 6 trials unstable angina, 3 trials acute pulmonary edema, and 1 trial sub-arachnoid hemorrhage patients.</P>
<P>There was no trial identified that included patients with acute aortic dissection and compared an active drug vs. placebo or no treatment within 24 hours of the onset. To the best of our knowledge there is only one randomized controlled trial that has included exclusively patients with acute aortic dissection and randomized their patients within 24 hour of the onset (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshida-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshida 1998</LINK>). However, this trial compared two active treatments, with no placebo arm.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:54:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Forty trials (60%) of the 65 included studies were double-blind, involving 75% (N=125,487) of the entire studied population. Less than 50% of the included trials reported adequate sequence generation, and only 23 trials (35%) reported concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Although, the number of trials reporting adequate concealment of allocation was relatively small [13/40(32%) for double-blind and 10/25(40%) for open-label design trials] the number of patients randomized with adequate concealment of allocation was very high (121,618 patients out of the total 125,487 in double-blind trials and 37,055 out of the total 40,719 in open-label trials); in other words the trials that did not report concealment of allocation were small in sample size. Thus, this type of risk of bias is considered to be low in this review. Similarly, although more than 75% of trials had an incomplete reporting or did not report on immediate all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), the studies that reported it were large enough (N=131,603) to keep this risk of incomplete outcome bias to a minimum. That was not the case for the &#8805; 30 day mortality in which less than 25 % reported mortality at times equal or greater than day 30 and the trials that reported were small, therefore there is a significant risk of bias for mortality data at this time. Selective outcome reporting bias was not an issue in this review by limiting the inclusion of trials where our primary outcome mortality is reported.</P>

It was not possible to do a secondary analysis (meta-regression or correlation ) comparing the effects of blood pressure lowering during the first 24 hours and health outcomes. No trial reported the standard deviation of the change for blood pressure or heart rate. Thus, this measure of variability was imputed from: the end point (second-top choice in our pre-specified hierarchy) in 14 trials; from the baseline value (third choice) in 1 trial; and from the weighted mean standard deviation at end point (last choice) in 4 trials.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-03 16:21:15 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Marco I Perez">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing an intervention with no treatment or placebo is the method of choice for determining efficacy and effectiveness. The optimal measure of net health effectiveness is the total number of patients with at least one SAE (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2002</LINK>). However in acute life-threatening cardiovascular events (CVEs) where the patient is hospitalized, total SAEs are particularly difficult to document and thus rarely measure it. In this review this was proven to be true as no trial reported this outcome. One possible reason is the subjectivity when physician must make a judgment as to whether a particular event led to prolongation of hospitalization as compared to the underlying life-threatening disease. Therefore, in this acute clinical setting total all-cause mortality has been considered the best measure of net health effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2008</LINK>). All-cause mortality is an outcome measure that is not subject to physician judgment and is usually reported in trials<B>.</B> That is the reason that we have focused primarily on total all-cause mortality in this systematic review.</P>
<P>The primary objective of this review was whether 24 to 48 hour (immediate) administration of blood pressure lowering drugs used within the first 24 hours of an acute cardiovascular event reduced mortality at three different time periods, 2 days, 10 days and &#8805;30 days. Our initial plan to pool the effects of all blood pressure lowering drugs proved to be inappropriate as the effects of the different classes of drugs was clearly heterogeneous. We have therefore presented the outcome data separately for each of the drug classes.</P>
<P>In studying the immediate intervention, the 2 day mortality provides a measure of the immediate benefits or harms and the 10 day and &#8805;30 day time periods provides a measure of delayed beneficial or harmful effects that only become manifest later. The principle here has been amply demonstrated by the fibrinolysis trials where early treatment leading to preservation of myocardium leads to reductions in mortality that are not manifest at 2 days, but which increase over time. For example, in <LINK REF="REF-ISIS_x002d_2-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISIS-2 1988</LINK> where 17,187 patients within 24 hours of the onset of a suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive immediate treatment with a thrombolytic drug or placebo resulted in having no effect on mortality at 48 hours (RR=1.04, 95%CI[0.89,1.21]), but reduced mortality at 10 days (RR= 0.82, 95%CI[0.74,0.91]) and at 35 days (RR=0.77, 95%CI[0.70,0.84]). Unfortunately, in this blood pressure lowering systematic review the number of trials that reported mortality at 10 days and &#8805;30 days after immediate treatment was insufficient to ascertain whether there were delayed benefits or harms. However, the data that are available suggests that the benefits at 10 days and &#8805;30 days is less than at 2 days, if anything. Therefore it does not provide any evidence suggesting any significant delayed benefit of immediate BP lowering.</P>
<P>The most important conclusion of this review comes from the mortality data at 2 days after immediate blood pressure lowering. At 2 days there was a highly significant reduction in mortality for nitrates (RR 0.81, 95%CI [0.74,0.89], p&lt;0.0001)<B> </B>and no significant reduction in mortality for the other classes of drugs. Since the data is incomplete, we cannot be very confident whether the hemodynamic effect among the different drug classes, during the first 24 hours, contributed to mortality differences. However, by indirectly comparing the two classes of drugs where statistically significant effects, compared to control, were seen, in these early hemodynamic changes, this review showed that the weighted mean systolic blood pressure lowering effect for beta-blockers (-12.54 mmHg) and for nitrates (-12.67 mmHg) was very similar, whereas the heart rate change was significantly different between the two classes (-9.68, -0.83 bpm, respectively). Despite this similarities and differences in these early hemodynamic changes, the day-2 mortality effect was favorable for nitrates (RR 0.81, 95%CI [0.74,0.89]) but not for beta-blockers (RR 0.95, 95%CI [0.85,1.07]).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we do not have hemodynamic data for ACE-inhibitors; and the data for CCB was too heterogeneous to yield statistical significance versus control.</P>
<P>This significant mortality benefit at 2 days for nitrates is based predominantly on the two largest trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>), but the authors of those trials have dismissed the finding, as the effect was no longer significant at 35 days. It is thus worth examining these two trials in more detail. The <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK> trial (N=58,050) was a factorial-design trial with three independent interventions: isosorbide mononitrate vs. placebo; captopril vs. placebo and magnesium vs. open control. The nitrate used was control-released isosorbide starting with 30 mg every 12 hours for the first day and followed by a maintenance dose of 60 mg daily for 28 days. However, during the first few days, all patients were allowed to receive non-study intravenous (IV) nitrates (approximately 47 % of patients in each group ultimately received these). The other large study (N=19,394) was an open-label, factorial design trial, <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>, with two independent comparisons: lisinopril vs. control; and glyceryl trinitrate vs. control. In the nitrate group patients were initiated with IV infusion of nitroglycerin at 5 to 20 &#956;g/min (to achieve at least 10% of SBP reduction) during the first 24 hours. After that, the IV infusion was replaced by a transdermal patch providing 10 mg of nitrate per day for 6 weeks. Also in this trial patients were allowed to receive non-study nitrates. The percentage of patients who received these in the control group was 57.1%, but the corresponding percentage for those allocated to the nitrate group was not reported.</P>
<P>In general, these two trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>) were similar in terms of population studied but dissimilar in design and drugs used. Despite the differences, the benefit for the nitrates at 2 days, was the same for both trials (RR 0.82, 95%CI [0.73,0.92]) and (RR 0.82, 95%CI [0.68,0.99]), respectively. Furthermore, the fact that the control group also received non-study nitrates makes it likely that this significant mortality benefit is underestimated . Based on this RCT evidence it is concluded that nitrates should be used routinely within 24 hours of the onset of an acute myocardial infarction as per baseline characteristics outlined in the RCTs.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, since treatment in these trials continued for more than 2 days, these two trials cannot be used to measure the delayed effect of the immediate use of nitrates on mortality at 10 days and &#8805; 30 days. In the available trials the immediate use of nitrates had no significant delayed mortality reduction at 10 days, (RR 0.84, 95%CI[0.69,1.01],p=0.07) or &#8805;30 days(RR 0.92, 95%CI[0.82,1.04],p=0.20) . The lack of a statistically significant effect is partly due to less data, but also due to the fact that the effect estimate appears to be diminishing over time. Thus, this is opposite to the effect seen with fibrinolytic agents and it is some evidence against a delayed benefit of immediate nitrate administration.</P>
<P>On the other hand these large trials, because they continued nitrates for 35 days, can be used to assess the mortality benefit of nitrates given from 3 to 10 days and from 10 to &#8805;30 days. The effect of nitrates administered from 3 to 10 days is shown in the sensitivity analysis, <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>, RR 0.98 [0.91 to 1.06]. This provides evidence for no benefit or harm, when nitrates are administered during this time period after an acute myocardial infarction. Furthermore when the effect of nitrates on mortality was assessed for the period from 10 to &#8805;30 days it is clear that nitrates are not beneficial (RR 1.10, 95%CI [1.00 to 1.22]). This provides relatively robust evidence for the lack of benefit from nitrates administered beyond day 2 after an acute myocardial infarction. This does not preclude the use of nitrates if other appropriate indications exists such as angina post-infarction.</P>
<P>The present systematic review did not find statistical evidence that immediate treatment with ACE inhibitors reduces mortality at 2 days after a myocardial infarction. Although, most of the evidence comes from the same 2 large trials where the nitrates were studied, the evidence is of borderline significance (RR 0.91, 95%CI [0.82,1.00], p=0.05), so that it remains possible that a real benefit has been missed. Other possible explanation is that ACEi could increase other serious adverse events in this early period. Evidence in favor of this possibility in <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK> is that cardiogenic shock or profound hypotension requiring termination of study treatment was significantly higher in the ACE-inhibitor group as compared to placebo (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) during the first 24-48 hours. It is also possible that the beneficial effect from ACE-inhibitors is specific to certain sub-groups of patients such as those patients with anterior infarction (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>). If that was the case the significant beneficial effect would be diluted in the overall effect. The best way to resolve this uncertainty is to do an individual patient meta-analysis of the available trials to try to identify subgroups of patients who benefit from routine use of ACE-inhibitors in this early phase of an acute MI.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there were only two small trials in which a delayed effect of the immediate treatment with ACE-inhibitors could be assessed. Therefore, there was insufficient RCT evidence to ascertain the delayed effects of these drugs when given as immediate treatment (within 24 hours and lasting for up to 48 hours) following an acute myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>The present systematic review demonstrated that the immediate treatment with BB was not associated with significant mortality benefit at 2 days (RR 0.95, 95%CI [0.85, 1.07], p=0.39), 10 days (RR 1.12, 95%CI [0.60, 2.07], p=0.73) or &#8805;30 days.<B> </B>However, there was very little data to assess the delayed effect of immediate treatment with beta-blockers. In addition there was significant heterogeneity for the day-2 mortality outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP>=67%). The heterogeneity was not explained by the type of beta-blocker. However, when a pre-planned sensitivity analysis was performed according to trial design (double-blind; open-label), BB were not associated with a significant reduction in mortality as compared with placebo or no treatment among 51,814 patients in double-blind trials (RR 1.04, 95%CI [0.91,1.19]; I<SUP>2</SUP>=30%) and was associated with a significant reduction in mortality among 16,193 patients in open-label trials (RR 0.73, 99%CI [0.58,0.91]; p=0.006; I<SUP>2</SUP>=69%). Given the clear lack of benefit in the double-blind trials, the most likely explanation for the benefit of beta blockers in the open label trials is that the two groups had other treatment differences than the planned intervention (performance bias). In keeping with that possibility, significantly more patients in the control group as compared to the beta-blocker group received calcium channel blockers drugs (RR 1.89 [1.74,2.06]; p&lt;0.00001) in <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_1-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-1 1986</LINK>. If calcium channel blockers increase mortality this would lead to false evidence of a mortality benefit for beta-blockers. The evidence of a clear lack of mortality benefit in the more robust double-blind trials makes us confident that routine use of beta-blockers early after an MI is not useful.</P>
<P>The present systematic review also showed that immediate treatment with CCBs was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 2 days, 10 or &#8805;30 days. This conclusion is weak due to the fact that the included trials do not report mortality at all of these times and because there were many CCB trials excluded from this meta-analysis, due to lack of reporting or improperly reported mortality data. The reason for this lack of or improper reporting of mortality is not known, however, we feel it is unlikely that trials demonstrating a mortality benefit would not have reported their results in full. We suspect that publication bias exists as we excluded 84% of the calcium channel blocker trials due to a lack of or insufficient mortality reporting. Therefore, if anything, we think that the data showing no benefit or harm from CCBs in this review is likely biased and that the full mortality data would show a statistically significant harm from CCBs.</P>
<P>The effects of short-term treatment provide additional information to what we have learned from the immediate treatment. Nitrates were again associated with a significant reduction in mortality at 10 days, however, as discussed above, this reduction was entirely accounted for by the immediate treatment reduction in mortality at 2 days. In contrast, ACE inhibitors after short-term treatment now show a significant effect at 10 days (RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.87,0.98]). The reason for the significant mortality benefit at 10 days is that, in contrast to the nitrates, in the two large trials (<LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>), the effect of the continued administration of ACE inhibitors was similar from 0 to 2 days (RR 0.91 ), from 3 to 10 days (RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.86 to 1.01]); and from day 11 to day 35 or 42 (RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.85 to 1.03]), see <LINK REF="FIG-20" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 20</LINK>. This resulted in a significant mortality benefit for ACE inhibitors continued for 35-42 days (RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.88 to 0.97]) as compared to a non-significant mortality effect of nitrates continued for 35-42 days (RR 0.97, 95%CI [0.92 to 1.02]). However, it is emphasized that in a trial where it was possible to compare nitrates vs. ACE inhibitors in a head to head comparisons, <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>, there was no differences in mortality at 42 days (7% vs. 6.6%). This led us to conclude that the routine use of ACE inhibitors post MI reduces mortality to a modest degree. However, it remains uncertain as to the optimal time of starting these drugs, and whether ACE inhibitors should be targeted at a subgroup of patients where the mortality benefit is larger.</P>
<P>The data to assess the effects of <B>short-term</B> treatment (lasting maximum 10 days) on mortality at &#8805; 30 days was sparse for nitrates (7 trials) and nil for the ACE-inhibitors.</P>
<P>In the present systematic review, <B>short-term</B> treatment with beta-blockers showed no statistically significant effect on mortality at 10 days (RR 0.96, 95%CI[0.91,1.02]; 14 trials, N=71,457), but a statistically significant effect at &#8805; 30 days (RR 0.91,95%CI [0.84,0.99], p=0.03; 5 trials, N=18,373). Although the effect at &#8805; 30 days is statistically significant, suggesting a delayed benefit with beta-blockers, we believe this is a chance effect and probably not real.  When mortality for these five trials was analyzed separately for the periods 0-10 days and 11 to &#8805; 30 days, a significant benefit is seen only during the first 10 days, contradicting the "suggested delayed benefit" shown above. Furthermore these results contradict the lack of significant mortality effect during the first 10 days, when all 14 trials with available data are considered. A potential explanation of these contradictions is publication bias from the 5 trials that reported data at &#8805; 30 days. In addition, the apparent exaggerated benefit in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_1-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-1 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yusuf-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Yusuf 1983</LINK>) is possible due to performance bias as in both trials significantly more patients received calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the control group. This could potentially increase mortality in the control group and exaggerate the benefit from the beta-blocker. The adverse effect of CCBs is in accordance with the findings of this review (see below).</P>
<P>Our systematic review showed that short-term treatment with CCBs was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 10 or &#8805;30 days. Similar to the effect of immediate treatment, this conclusion is not robust because only a small percentage of CCB trials could be included in this review. In our sensitivity analyses, there was a trend towards a greater mortality among MI patients treated short-term with calcium channel blockers as compared to placebo (RR 1.60 95%CI[0.90, 2.86]); particularly in those receiving dihydropyridine CCBs (RR 1.91, 95%CI[0.98, 3.72]).</P>
<P>Only 5 acute stroke RCTs were included in the present systematic review and all of these studied calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs. CCBs were not associated with significant effect on mortality at 10 days (RR 0.81, 95%CI [0.54,1.21]) in this setting. This evidence is clearly insufficient to know whether CCBs are beneficial or harmful in acute stroke patients.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-03 16:30:13 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Marco I Perez">
<P>Out of 135 potentially appropriate randomized controlled trials we excluded 65 studies in which mortality data was non-extractable or usable for our review. Thus this data, if made available by the authors, could be added to our review . Of these 65 excluded trials, <B>14</B> involved an ACE inhibitor (N=4,407); <B>21</B> trials involved a B-adrenergic Blocker (N=2,524); <B>8</B> trials involved a nitrate (N=1,475) and <B>20</B> trials involved a CCB (N=10,958). These excluded patients make up a small proportion of the available included patients, for the ACE inhibitors, 5.0% ; BBs 3.4% ; and nitrates 1.7% , but a large proportion of the calcium channel blocker population, 84% . Due to the relatively small number of excluded patients and trials for the ACEi, BB and nitrates groups, we are pretty confident that the effect sizes calculated in these meta-analysis are a good estimate of the true effect. However, that is not the case for CCBs, where it is more likely that the non-significant increase in short-term mortality among those patients with acute myocardial infarction found in this review (RR 1.60 95%CI[0.90, 2.86]) would become statistically significant.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We have no information about the effects on mortality of other blood pressure lowering drugs (such as clonidine, prazosin, hydralazine, etc) used within 24 hours of the onset of an acute myocardial infarction or stroke. Likewise, we have no information regarding the effects on mortality produced by drugs embraced in this review started within 24 hours of the onset of other cardiovascular events such as acute aortic dissection, acute pulmonary edema, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage or unstable angina because mortality data was not assessed or reported in these conditions. To the best of our knowledge there is only one randomized controlled trial including only patients with acute aortic dissection and randomizing the patients within 24 hour of the onset (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshida-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshida 1998</LINK>). However, this trial compared two active treatments.<BR/>
<BR/>Thus, this systematic review evidence is primarily applicable to patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving blood pressure lowering drugs within 24 hours of the onset of the event and having a level of risk similar to those participants from the randomized trials included in this review. Since the evidence for effectiveness of nitrates and ACE-inhibitors mostly comes from two large trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>) the practical recommendations primarily apply to patients having the following characteristics:</P>

<P>Forty trials (60%) out of 65 included studies were double-blind, involving 75% (N=125,487) of the entire studied population. Although, the number of trials reporting adequate concealment of allocation was relatively small [13/40 (32%) in double-blind and 10/25 (40%) in open-label design trials] the number of patients randomized with concealment of allocation was very high (121,618 in double-blind trials out of a total 125,487 and 37,055 in open-label trials out of a total 40,719 ). Similarly, although more than 75% of trials had an incomplete or not reported all-cause mortality at 2 days, the studies that indeed reported it were large enough (N=131,603) to decrease this risk of incomplete outcome to a minimum. That was not the case for &#8805;30 day mortality which was reported by less than 25 % of trials and the trials were not large enough (24,918) to dismiss the possibility of bias for this outcome.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 22:14:36 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>One limitation of the present review is that we did not consider many trials, which claimed enrolling their patients in the early period of an acute cardiovascular event, i.e. within 48 to 72 hours. Evidently in these types of studies it is anticipated that some patients could be enrolled and have started their study treatment within 24 hours; therefore, data from these patients are missing from our review. Including such patients would require obtaining individual patient data from these reviews, which was not possible. We have tried to get information from some recent trials of this type (for example from the <LINK REF="REF-ACCESS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCESS 2003</LINK> trial), but with no success. Even though we accept this as a limitation, we feel that adding these trials would create a more unacceptable limitation as we are interested in determining the specific effects of early treatment and we do not want to contaminate that with patients enrolled after the early vulnerable period.</P>
<P>Another limitation of this review is that we assessed blood pressure and heart rate changes only for the first 24 hours of the initiation of treatment. The objective was to assess whether these early changes can be related to mortality at 2, 10 or &#8805;30 days. Expanding the time window for these measures would likely have made more data available, however we think that the effects during the first 24 hours are the most important. An additional problem was encountered in these acute settings where significant number of patients are censored in terms of BP and heart rate data due to death, withdrawals or losses to follow-up. Therefore it is difficult to have BP data in the same population that is contributing to the mortality data. We are aware that due to the fact that BP and heart rate data were only available from certain number of trials we do not have a high degree of confidence in the magnitude of these measures.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-26 16:00:10 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Marco I Perez">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nitrates:</HEADING>
<P>There is a previous overview and meta-analysis that assessed the effects of nitrates in patients with acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1988</LINK>). With only 2,000 patients they found a significant effect (OR 0.55, 95%CI [0.39,0.76]) on early (first week or in hospital) mortality. These authors did not distinguish between immediate treatment or short-term treatment. Our overall results at 10 days (or hospital) including both immediate and short-term treatment is not in accordance with their effect estimate: OR 0.90,95%CI [0.85,0.96]p=0.0008. Our results with the inclusion of more recent larger trials in 84,185 patients is clearly a better estimate of the true treatment effect.</P>
<P>Our results are also in disagreement with the guidelines from the the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>). In chapter VI regarding the <I>initial management of MI in the emergency department</I> these guidelines have relegated the use of nitrates (nitroglycerin exclusively) to patients with ongoing ischemic discomfort or control of hypertension or management of pulmonary congestion.</P>
<P>The present systematic review demonstrates that the use of nitrates within 24 hours significantly reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.81, 95%CI [0.74,0.89], p&lt;0.0001) at 2 days. This is consistent with 4 or 8 deaths prevented for 1000 low or high risk patients treated, respectively (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Therefore, routine nitrates should be administered to all patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction, who do not have the specific contraindications outlined above. Due to its proven effectiveness in the <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK> trial and ease of administration, controlled-release oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate 30 mg twice a day the first day and 60 mg the second day is the best choice. However, the use of routine nitrates should be restricted to the first 48 hours as there was no further reduction in mortality associated with their use beyond day 2.</P>
<P>The mechanism whereby nitrates reduce mortality in the immediate period after an acute MI and not after that is not known. Since it appears from this review that blood pressure reduction is not the explanation, there must be another mechanism. Nitrates have been used for more than a century to relieve myocardial ischemia and chest pain. This has been thought to be due to their vasodilatory effects: venous, arterial, coronary vessels and on the redistribution of blood flow towards the ischemic subendocardium. These mechanisms may explain the early mortality benefit.</P>
<P>A second possible mechanism is that nitric oxide donors such as nitrates and nitroprusside inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation. In the late 1980's <I>in vivo</I> animal experiments demonstrated that an infusion of nitroglycerin reduced platelet deposition on damaged arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1988</LINK>). These findings were confirmed in the early 1990's <I>in vivo</I> (<LINK REF="REF-De-Caterina-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Caterina 1990</LINK>) showing that isosorbide mono-nitrates produced a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane production induced by adenosine diphosphate and adrenaline in patients with objectively proven coronary artery disease. A controlled study (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 1998</LINK>) demonstrated that nitroprusside given at a dose which reduced MAP by 10 mmHg, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation and improved regional cerebral blood flow. Furthermore, the results from <LINK REF="STD-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ISIS-4 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ESPRIM-1994" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIM 1994</LINK> trials support this theory, as they showed a greater mortality benefit with nitrates in patients who never received anti-platelets drugs. For example, in the former, the difference in mortality between the nitrate group and placebo group in patients who never received anti-platelets was 15.7% vs. 17.7%, respectively (RR 0.89). In contrast, this difference was negligible in patients who did receive anti-platelet drugs, 6.9% vs. 7.0%, respectively (RR 0.99). An explanation for the early and not late nitrate benefit is that the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (outflow of catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine) is increased in the immediate period of myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsberg-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsberg 1981</LINK>). At this early time catecholamines would be the most prominent inductive mechanism for platelet aggregation. It has been shown that nitric oxide donors such as nitrates exert a platelet aggregation inhibitory response only induced by ADP and catecholamines (<LINK REF="REF-De-Caterina-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Caterina 1990</LINK>). That is, nitrates do not interfere with the ongoing thrombotic stimulus induced by thrombin, collagen or other stronger inducers of thromboxane generation and platelet aggregation.</P>
<P>A third potential explanation for the early mortality benefit conferred by nitrates is that, in addition to their hemodynamic and cardiac work-load benefits, they might interfere with the heart excitability and/or conduction system in the early hours following the myocardial infarction. Before the identification of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor as nitric oxide in the late 80's there were some reports showing that nitrates have anti-arrhythmic effects in acute myocardial ischemia animal models( <LINK REF="REF-Borer-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borer 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cano-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cano 1986</LINK>). At that time the theory that nitrates work through the release of nitric oxide (NO) increasing guanosine 3':5'- cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) was presented (<LINK REF="REF-Katsuki-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsuki 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kukovetz-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kukovetz 1979</LINK>). More recently, others have reported the effects of nitric oxide on the excitability of the autonomic cells (sinoatrial node or atrioventricular node <LINK REF="REF-Exner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Exner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Han-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martynyuk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martynyuk 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Han-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musialek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musialek 1997</LINK>) or directly on myocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Brahmajothi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brahmajothi 2007</LINK>). The fact that neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) has now been identified in the nerve fibers of the heart (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hassall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 1992)</LINK>, suggests a broader role of NO in the heart's electrophysiology . An augmented expression on nNOS during acute myocardial infarction in animal models has been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Takimoto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takimoto 2002</LINK>). Thus, an anti-arrhythmic effect from nitrates/nitric oxide remains a possibility (<LINK REF="REF-Brack-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brack 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chowdhary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhary 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fei-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fei 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pabla-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pabla 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACE-inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>The effects of ACEi on AMI patients have been reported in two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-AMICG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMICG 1998</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>). In the former, 98,496 patients were included from trials comparing ACEi vs. placebo or no treatment. The authors demonstrated a mortality reduction with ACEi obtained at 7 days and 30 days (RR 0.92, 95%CI [0.86,0.97]; and RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.89,0.98], respectively. Thus, these 10 day findings are very similar to ours. The other ACEi systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>) had the objective to assess the effect of long-term treatments as they did not limited the length of treatment in the trials and quantified mortality at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year. Thus, this review cannot be compared to ours.</P>
<P>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK>) have recommended that an ACEi should be administered orally within the first 24 hours of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) to patients with anterior infarction, pulmonary congestion or LVEF less than 0.40 in the absence of hypotension or known contraindications to that class of medications. However, in a second paragraph they further state that ACEi administered within the first 24 hours of STEMI can be useful without the above characteristics.</P>
<P>In our ACEi analysis the effect estimates for open-label trials and double-blind trials differ at 2 days RR 0.86, 95%CI [0.71,1.03]) and RR 0.93, 95%CI [0.83,1.04]), respectively, calling into question the borderline overall mortality benefit at 2 days (RR 0.91, 95%CI [0.82,1.00]), p=0.05. Furthermore, nitrates confer a superior relative 0.81 vs. 0.91, and absolute mortality benefit 4-8 per 1000 vs. 2-4 per 1000, respectively. Thus, we feel that the optimal time of administration of ACE inhibitors post acute MI is presently unknown and further research is required.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Beta-adrenergic antagonists (BB)</HEADING>
<P>Other systematic reviews (SRs) have evaluated the effect of beta-blockers (BB) in AMI (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Reesi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Reesi 2008</LINK>). All of these reviews have accepted trials where treatment was started later than 24 hours after the onset of AMI. <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK> concluded that reliable estimation of the effects of early beta blockade on mortality has not yet been achieved. <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK> also concluded that there were no mortality benefits from BB in "short-term" trials. The most recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Reesi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Reesi 2008</LINK>), inexplicably excluded 11 trials that we included in our review. Despite that, their conclusion stating that "acute intervention with B-blockers does not result in statistical significant short-term survival benefit following AMI" is in agreement with ours.</P>
<P>Despite these systematic reviews <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK> recommended that oral beta-blocker therapy should be administered promptly to those suspected MI patients without a contraindication irrespective of concomitant fibrinolytic therapy or performance of primary PCI.</P>
<P>Based on our systematic review we do not recommend routine BB for the immediate or short-term treatment of patients with suspected MI. However, it should be emphasized that these findings and recommendations are not contradictory to the long-term mortality benefits for BB post MI when these drugs are started a few days or weeks after myocardial infarction and continued for some months (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>) .</P>

<I>In Acute Myocardial infarction</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>The one other systematic review that has assessed CCB drug in patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina (<LINK REF="REF-Held-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Held 1989</LINK>) also included trials in which treatment was started after 24 hours or trials where the time of entry was not specified. However, they also concluded that "CCBs do not reduce the risk of initial or recurrent infarction or death when given routinely to patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA_x002c_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA, 2004</LINK> have restricted the use of CCB by stating that it is reasonable to give verapamil or diltiazem to patients in whom beta-blockers are ineffective or contraindicated for relief of ongoing ischemia or control of a rapid ventricular response with atrial fibrillation of flutter after STEMI in the absence of CHF, LV dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) block.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>In Stroke</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>There is one Cochrane systematic review already published that assessed CCBs in acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2000</LINK>) but with a different research question from ours. Their focus was not limited to the immediate initiation of treatment and for short term treatment. They included 28 studies. Of those, 12 trials had required their patients to start treatment within 24 hours of the onset. Of those, we have excluded one trial because it compared IV infusion vs. oral treatment, rather than CCB vs. placebo; and 5 trials because mortality data was not reported or usable in our review. Despite the differences their conclusion "No evidence is available to justify the use of calcium antagonists in patients with acute ischemic stroke" agrees with ours.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Two Cochrane systematic reviews involving patients with acute stroke and blood pressure lowering drugs have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2008</LINK>). The former assessed nitrates for acute stroke with different methodology and objectives than ours. Studies were not limited to truly randomized trials or to the immediate initiation of treatment and for short term treatment. Since only 2 studies were included the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nitrates. We did not include those two trials because treatment started days after the onset of the stroke. <LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2008</LINK> also had a different approach to ours, as it was not limited to RCTs studying blood pressure lowering drugs. In addition, in this review RCTs are not limited to a certain time of starting treatment after the stroke (for example, it included trials where treatment started even 7 days after the onset).  Out of their 12 included studies, 3 trials started the treatment within 24 hours. We excluded all these 3 for the following reasons: in the <LINK REF="REF-INTERACT-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">INTERACT 2008</LINK> trial, patients were not allocated to a class of drug vs. placebo or no treatment. Instead, patients were allocated to two different BP targets (140 vs. 180 mmHg) to be achieved in 1 hour and maintained for 7 days. The <LINK REF="REF-ACCESS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCESS 2003</LINK> trial included patients within 24 and 36 hours but without separating their results according to these times.  And in the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eveson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eveson 2007</LINK>) results were not based on ITT principles. Patients first were randomized and then withdrawn if the diagnosis was wrong. Analysis was not performed based on all randomized patients.</P>

<P>Funding: The Wijnand M Pon Foundation.</P>
<P>The trial used a particular method for closing-out. Patients in the treatment and control groups were paired on the basis of their entry numbers- for example the fifth patient allocated to nitroprusside was paired with the fifth patient who received placebo. Then, the outcomes were scored according to those pairs as a tie, in favour of nitroprusside or placebo, respectively. However, they used a "closed" plan which meant that the trial had to end when a maximum of 62 pairs yielding preferences had been plotted.</P>
<P>The critic of this is that it is not clear how the pairs were chosen, i.e., consecutively, randomly, or by outcome. If a total of 62 pairs were chosen and there were a total of 328 randomized patients, then it seems that the pairs were not chosen in consecutive order or randomly.<BR/>

<B>Drug regimens</B>
</P>
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate was initially started as IV infusion at a rate of 5 mcg x min with adjustments every 5 minutes of 5-20 mcg/min to achieve a target of systolic blood pressure reduction of at least 10 % but not lower than 90 mm Hg, during the first 24 hours. After that the IV infusion was replaced with a patch providing 10 mg of nitrate transdermally per day. The patch was removed at bedtime. The duration of study treatment was for 6 weeks.  Note: if the patch was not tolerated a single oral dose of 50 mg isosorbide mononitrate was given daily.</P>
<P>Control group ( open control) was given no study treatment ( no further details)</P>
<P>Lisinopril was also given for 6 weeks. Initially, 5 mg every 24 hours was given. After 48 hours ,10 mg/ day was given until completion of 6  weeks. If systolic blood pressure was reduced (within the first 3 days) to less than 120 mm Hg a dose of 2.5 mg was given. If, at any time. systolic blood pressure was reduced to less or equal to 100 mm Hg, a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily could be adopted. If SBP was reduced to less than 90 the therapy was stopped.</P>
<P>Control group ( open control) was given no study treatment ( no further details)</P>

<P>Uncertain time of inclusion of patients. For example, It is stated that patients were to be included "on admission", but treatment started after 24 hours in &gt;15% of patients with AMI and mortality data was not reported separately for those starting earlier or later than the 24 hours. An additional problem was that these AMI patients were part of a subset of the entire randomized patients (AMI-41% + suspected AMI-59%) based on intention to treat analysis. Therefore, it should not be dismissed the possibility of the inclusion of additional patients being admitted later than 24 hours if all randomized patients were considered</P>

<P>
<B>Comment:</B> neither in the original publication (Lancet 1995;345:669-685) nor in the published protocol Am J Cardiol 1991;68:87D-100D) it is clearly stated that this trial was actually a double-blind trial. Based on the description of its design it is assumed that there was double-blinding for the comparison captopril vs. placebo and isosorbide vs. placebo ( in the consent form -page 91D- there is a paragraph that says "These study tablets would be either active or inactive ones -neither we nor you would know which, because the information is kept on a secret code list at another hospital.." ) but not for magnesium vs. open control. However, it is stated that the administration of other non-study nitrates was permitted openly as long it was for the first few days.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Early stop of the trial. The trialist used a particular method for closing-out. Patients in the treatment and control groups were paired on the basis of their entry numbers- for example the fifth patient allocated to nitroprusside was paired with the fifth patient who received placebo. Then, the outcomes were scored according to those pairs as a tie, in favour of nitroprusside or placebo, respectively. However, they used a &#8220;closed&#8221; plan which meant that the trial had to end when a maximum of 62 pairs. They used a skew version of the plan with the lower boundary  much shorter than the upper since they &#8220;did not wish to determine whether nitroprusside might be worse than placebo&#8221; . </P>

<P>Dear Marco</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Thank you for your letter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The first study (int J cardiol 1994;43;43-50) was performed to   verify the addition of captopril in AMI patients. This is a single blind study and end points were reperfusion damage and clinical outcome.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The other study (Int J Cardiol 1994; 46:107-112) was an extension of the first study. In fact ,in this study we analyzed  the AMI patients enrolled in first study to control  the effect of beta-blocker treatment (alone or associated with captopril or placebo). In fact, it was not possible to perform a randomization because in 1994 beta-blockers in acute phses of AMI  was  reccomnede treatment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The two studies were reports of the same trial  and studied  different therapeuthic associations.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Pietro Di Pasquale MD.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>P.S. In the  2° study the patients with inferior AMI were excluded. This is the reason  for lower number of patients in the 2° study.(84 pts versus 82 pts)</P>
<P>        In the first study the randomized patients were 131 vs 128 (anterior AMI+Inferior AMI). Of the 479 pts,78 were not suitable for thrombolysis,16 Killip class &gt; 2,14             were sub-acute AMi,30 pts were receiving ACE-inhibitors at entry, and 51 were classified as unstable angina (no enzymatic variation). The study was adressed to             AMI thrombolysed and reperfused. The same was used in the 2° trial.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dear Marco</P>
<P> </P>
<P>I found the data on mortality with very dificult in old registry.</P>
<P> </P>
<P> </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Mortality In reperfused  Captopril group (131 patients);  2 anterior AMI (1 Re-IMA and 1 Heart Failure) during hospitalization, and 3 anterior AMI for HF  in the fisrt 6 month</P>
<P>                                  2 inferior AMI (Re-IMA within 3 months)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>                                   Place group: (128 patients); Anterior AMI; (2 Re-IMA and 3 HF ) durng hospitalization; and 9 anterior AMI for HF   in the first 8 months.</P>

<P>I would like to inform that the 2° study was the first in the literature comparing the assocition of Beta-blocker and ACE-in with Beta-blocker alone,captopril alone and placebo. The results of this study showed that i.v. beta-blocker treatment in acute phases of AMI is not benefical compared with captopri,while as now recommended the benefical effects of beta blockers are reported when administerd later and orally.</P>

<BR/>Dear Dr. Perez,<BR/> <BR/>my name is Eugenio Santoro and I am co-author of the paper:<BR/> <BR/>&#8220;GISSI-3. Effects of lisiriopril and transdermal glyceryl trinitrate singly and together on 6-week mortality and ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. The Lancet 1994 May 7;343(8906):1115-22.<BR/>Pedrazzini G, Santoro E, Latini R, Fromm L, Franzosi MG, Mocetti T, et al. Causes of death in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: findings from the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto (GISSI)-3 trial. Am Heart J 2008 Feb;155(2):388-94.&#8221;<BR/>
<BR/>I was also involved in the statistical analyses of the GISSI-3 main papers.<BR/> <BR/>This is to answer to your message related to the 10 July 2008 request of receiving data for the systematic review entitled  "Effect of early treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs on short and long-term health outcomes in patients with an acute cardiovascular event ".<BR/> <BR/>Firstly the discrepancies you found about the 42 days mortality rate between the original (1994) and the 2008 paper was due to the fact that some extra mortality data was found. This has been already reported and well documented in the 1996 paper (GISSI3. Six month effects of early treatment with lisinopril and .. JACC 1996;27:337-44)  when, performing the 6 months follow-up analyses, we traced mortality data (at 6 weeks and 6 months) of 423 randomized patients originally excluded from the 1994 paper because of the lack of any kind of data.<BR/> <BR/>This also explains why the number of patients analyzed for the 6 weeks mortality in the 1994 paper were 18895 while they were 19318 in the 1996 (and 2008) paper.<BR/> <BR/>In conclusion, the correct data are<BR/> <BR/>Mortality at week 6  from 2008 paper<BR/>Lisinopril group: 619 (6.4%) out of 9646 pts<BR/>Control group (no Lisinopril): 693 (7.2%) out of 9672<BR/>
<BR/> <BR/>Coming back to your request these are the 10 days mortality data stratified by treatment allocation:<BR/> <BR/> <BR/>
<B>All cause mortality at 10 days<BR/>
</B>-----------------------<BR/>Lisinopril group: 435 (4.5%) out of 9646 pts<BR/>Control group (no Lisinopril): 486 (5.0%) out of 9672<BR/>
<BR/>Nitrate group: 443 (4.6%) out of 9663 pts<BR/>Control group (no Nitrate): 478 (4.9%) out of 9655<BR/>
<BR/>Please, dont&#8217;t esitate to contact me for any clarification.<BR/> <BR/>Best wishes<BR/>

<BR/>
<BR/>Dear Dr. Perez,<BR/>
<BR/>I apologize for the very long delay.<BR/>
<BR/>Please find enclosed the requested data.<BR/>
<BR/>Consider that I have used deaths at day 0 (pts dead the same date they entered into the trial) and death at day 1 (the day after randomization) as mortality at day 2.<BR/>
<BR/>The results, stratified by treatment allocation are:<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>All cause mortality at  day 2<BR/>
</B>-----------------------<BR/>Lisinopril group: 200 (2.1%) out of 9646 pts<BR/>Control group (no Lisinopril): 234 (2.4%) out of 9672<BR/>
<BR/>Nitrate group: 196 (2.0%) out of 9663 pts<BR/>Control group (no Nitrate): 238 (2.5%) out of 9655<BR/> <BR/>Sorry again for the dealy<BR/>
<BR/>Please don't hesitate to contact me for any clarification.<BR/>
<BR/>I will be very grateful if you could notify me when the paper is published.<BR/>
<BR/>Best wishes<BR/>
