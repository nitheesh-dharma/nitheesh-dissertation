<TITLE>Cilostazol for peripheral arterial disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blockages in the arteries to the legs - peripheral arterial disease - affect 20% of people over 70 years of age and 4% to 12% of the population aged 55 to 70 years. Approximately 40% of those affected with peripheral arterial disease complain of pain in the legs on walking, this is known as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication is characterised by pain in the legs or buttocks that occurs with exercise and which subsides with rest. The symptoms of intermittent claudication are an indicator for the development of blocked arteries elsewhere in the body. Compared with age-matched controls, people with intermittent claudication have a three- to six-fold increased chance of dying as a result of cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>The majority of patients with intermittent claudication are treated with best medical management. Symptoms of intermittent claudication, walking distance, and quality of life can be improved by risk factor modification, which includes smoking cessation and a structured exercise programme. Further cardiovascular risk modification includes treatment for hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol reduction. In practice, compliance with best medical treatment is poor and most people continue to have symptoms of intermittent claudication. Some drug therapies are used specifically to help improve walking distance in intermittent claudication and cilostazol is one of these. We have looked at the evidence supporting cilostazol in improving the symptoms of intermittent claudication.</P>
<P>This review included fifteen double-blind, randomised controlled trials, with a total of 3718 participants. The risk of bias was poor over all of the studies but the results from this review suggest that cilostazol improves walking distances and ankle-brachial pressure (blood pressure in the legs) for people with intermittent claudication. Side effects were mostly mild. There is currently not enough information to determine if there is an association between cilostazol and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events or changes in quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:18:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects between 4% and 12% of people aged 55 to 70 years, and 20% of people over 70 years. A common complaint is intermittent claudication, characterised by pain in the legs or buttocks that occurs with exercise and which subsides with rest. Compared with age-matched controls, people with intermittent claudication have a three- to six-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality. Symptoms of intermittent claudication, walking distance, and quality of life can be improved by risk factor modification, smoking cessation, and a structured exercise programme. Antiplatelet treatment is beneficial in patients with intermittent claudication for the reduction of vascular events but has not previously been shown to influence claudication distance. This is an update of a review first published in 2007.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed trials for selection and independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included fifteen double-blind, RCTs comparing cilostazol with placebo, or medications currently known to increase walking distance e.g. pentoxifylline. There were a total of 3718 randomised participants with treatment durations ranging from six to 26 weeks. All participants had intermittent claudication secondary to PAD. Comparisons included cilostazol twice daily, with dosages of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg compared with placebo, and cilostazol 100 mg, twice daily, compared with pentoxifylline 400 mg, three times daily. The methodological quality of the trials was generally low, with the majority being at an unclear risk for selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and other bias. Attrition bias was generally low, but reporting bias was high or unclear in the majority of the studies. For eight studies data were compatible for comparison by meta-analysis, but data for seven studies were too heterogenous to be pooled. For the studies included in the meta-analysis, for initial claudication distance (ICD - the distance walked on a treadmill before the onset of calf pain) there was an improvement in the cilostazol group for the 100 mg and 50 mg twice daily, compared with placebo (WMD 31.41 metres, 95% CI 22.38 to 40.45 metres; P &lt; 0.00001) and WMD 19.89 metres, 95% CI 9.44 to 30.34 metres; P = 0.0002), respectively. ICD was improved in the cilostazol group for the comparison of cilostazol 150 mg versus placebo and cilostazol 100 mg versus pentoxifylline, but only single studies were used for these analyses. Absolute claudication distance (ACD - the maximum distance walked on a treadmill) was significantly increased in participants taking cilostazol 100 mg and 50 mg twice daily, compared with placebo (WMD 43.12 metres, 95% CI 18.28 to 67.96 metres; P = 0.0007) and WMD 32.00 metres, 95% CI 14.17 to 49.83 metres; P = 0.0004), respectively. As with ICD, ACD was increased in participants taking cilostazol 150 mg versus placebo, but with only one study an association cannot be clearly determined. Two studies comparing cilostazol to pentoxifylline had opposing findings, resulting in an imprecise CI (WMD 13.42 metres (95% CI -43.51 to 70.35 metres; P = 0.64). Ankle brachial index (ABI) was lowered in the cilostazol 100 mg group compared with placebo (WMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.08; P &lt; 0.00001). The single study evaluating ABI for the comparison of cilostazol versus pentoxifylline found no change in ABI.</P>
<P>There was no association between treatment type and all-cause mortality for any of the treatment comparisons, but there were very few events, and therefore larger, adequately powered studies will be needed to assess if there is a relationship. Only one study evaluated individual cardiovascular events, and from this study there is no clear evidence of a difference between any of the treatment groups and risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. We evaluated adverse side effects, and in general cilostazol was associated with a higher odds of headache, diarrhoea, abnormal stool, dizziness and palpitations. We only reported quality of life measures descriptively as there was insufficient statistical detail within the studies to combine the results, although there was a possible indication in improvement of quality of life in the cilostazol treatment groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cilostazol has been shown to be of benefit in improving walking distance in people with intermittent claudication secondary to PAD. Although there is an increase in adverse side effects, they are generally mild and treatable. There is currently insufficient data on whether taking cilostazol results in a reduction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events or an improvement in quality of life. Future research into the effect of cilostazol on intermittent claudication should carefully consider comparability, sample size and homogeneity when designing a study.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower extremities, affecting 20% of people over 70 years of age and 4% to 12% of the population aged 55 to 70 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PAD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAD 2003</LINK>). Patients with PAD commonly complain of intermittent claudication, which is characterised by pain in the legs or buttocks that occurs with exercise and subsides with rest, and occurs in 40% of PAD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1999</LINK>). Despite the relatively benign prognosis for the affected limb, the symptoms of intermittent claudication are an indicator for systemic atherosclerosis. Compared with age-matched controls, people with intermittent claudication have a three- to six-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of patients with intermittent claudication are treated with best medical management (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2005</LINK>), and the mainstay of treatment for patients with PAD is cardiovascular risk factor modification. This consists of smoking cessation, prescribed exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>), antiplatelet treatment, lipid-lowering therapy and control of blood pressure and diabetes. Only two-thirds of compliant patients will achieve symptomatic relief of intermittent claudication after three to six months. Some patients may not be able to comply with prescribed exercise due to associated comorbidity or social reasons. As angioplasty or surgery are only used in severe, disabling or progressive intermittent claudication, these symptomatic patients may benefit from adjunctive therapy.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cilostazol, with the trade name Pletal, is a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor that has antiplatelet and antithrombotic actions (<LINK REF="REF-Sallustio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sallustio 2010</LINK>). Cilostazol also acts on smooth muscle cells as a vasodilator with beneficial effects on triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>). Cilostazol is indicated for intermittent claudication but there is also evidence to suggest that cilostazol may have a role in reducing restenosis after endovascular therapy and coronary stenting (<LINK REF="REF-Iida-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>).The suggested dose of cilostazol for intermittent claudication is 100 mg taken orally twice daily. Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure and those with renal or hepatic impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiplatelet therapy is effective in long term secondary prevention of vascular events in patients at high risk of vascular disease, including those who have had ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction, and a benefit of antiplatelet treatment in patients with intermittent claudication in the reduction of vascular events has been previously observed (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PAD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAD 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robless-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2001</LINK>). It is unclear exactly how cilostazol works to improve claudication, but the mechanism is most likely multifactorial, involved with several of cilostazol's actions, specifically vasodilation, possible beneficial inhibition of platelet aggregation, and altering a patient's lipid profile (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizzo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueno-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueno 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In practice, compliance with best medical treatment is poor and most people remain symptomatic with intermittent claudication. Until recently there have been three options; supervised exercise, angioplasty or bypass surgery. Compliance with supervised exercise is poor, the durability of angioplasty is unproven and surgery carries significant morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1998</LINK>). Many pharmacological agents have been advocated for the symptomatic treatment of intermittent claudication but until recently none have gained acceptance. Cilostazol has been approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication and has been shown to improve pain-free walking distance (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 2004</LINK>). If cilostazol is found to reduce the symptoms of claudication, as well as cardiovascular risk in patients with PAD, it would be beneficial for patients whose options are otherwise limited, and possibly extreme. This is an update of a review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Robless-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>RB and MS independently assessed the methodological quality of included trials using the 'Risk of bias' tool from the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the following domains: selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting) and other bias. We classified the domains as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias, according to the guidelines in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two review authors assessing bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:19:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We pooled the data on the initial claudication distances (ICDs) and absolute claudication distances (ACDs) and other available outcomes from each trial to obtain an overall estimate of the effectiveness of cilostazol therapy. We aimed to calculate mean change from baseline for each trial, which is more informative of treatment effect than simply comparing final walking distances because it takes baseline measures into account. Due to the differences in treadmill testing methods between the studies, mean change from baseline is the only appropriate measure for treatment effect. The results for continuous data are presented as a weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. We performed statistical analyses according to the guidelines for reviews outlined in the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's module (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html">http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html</A>).</P>

<P>For this update we included 15 studies. A total of 3718 participants were randomised with treatment duration between six and 26 weeks.

<P>For the walking distance outcomes (initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD)) the treadmill test methods varied between three protocols. Five studies used a method with an immediate and constant gradient of 10% and a constant speed of 3.2 km/h (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_103" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-103</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_87_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-87-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_94_x002d_301" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-94-301</LINK>). Five studies used a similar method with an immediate and constant gradient of 12.5% and a constant speed of 3.2 km/h (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_95_x002d_201" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-95-201</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_98_x002d_213" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-98-213</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strandness-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strandness 2002</LINK>). Four studies adopted a delayed gradient treadmill method where the gradient began at 0% and increased by 3.5% every three minutes, with a constant speed of 3.2 km/h (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Albuquerque-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Albuquerque 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Money-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Money 1998</LINK>). It should be noted the <LINK REF="STD-de-Albuquerque-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Albuquerque 2008</LINK> study did not state the gradient by which the treadmill was increased, but it was assumed to be similar to the other three studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Brass-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brass 2012</LINK> study only described their treadmill method as "graded" and referred to another study, but we were unable to determine from this which method was used.</P>
<P>Of the eight newly included studies seven do not include data on walking distances or ankle brachial index (ABI) that are appropriate to contribute to the meta-analysis of walking distances and ABI (<LINK REF="STD-Brass-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brass 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Albuquerque-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Albuquerque 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_103" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-103</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_87_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-87-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_94_x002d_301" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-94-301</LINK>). This is due to methodological differences in the reporting of outcomes that did not allow us to calculate mean change and standard deviations. Also, due to the large differences between studies, we deemed imputation inappropriate. Descriptions of the findings of these studies will be addressed under the appropriate outcome headings. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> describes reasoning for why these studies could not appropriately be included in the meta-analyses of walking distances and ABI.

The <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK> study only reported quality of life measures in a subgroup of normoglycaemic patients. Due to the differences of quality of life measures taken, as well as how they were reported, we could not compile a meta-analysis to describe the association at this time. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> provides basic change in quality of life measures as either points or percentages, as reported in the individual studies. This table should be interpreted with caution, as no hypothesis testing has been performed, and the data format differs between studies.</P>
<P>The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, general health questionnaire made of 36 questions from eight subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. Each subscale is scored on a scale of zero to 100. The WIQ scale is intended for patients with intermittent claudication and gathers data on walking distance and speed using degree of difficulty scoring from zero to four, with zero being unable to perform the task and four representing no difficulty. The COM is another disease specific testing method for scoring participants with intermittent claudication. It assesses severity of walking pain and discomfort with short and long distances and how participants feel the disease impacts other aspects of their life, including emotional and social. VascuQol is designed for participants with PAD and consists of 25 questions with answer options of one to seven, spanning five domains of interest: physical activity, symptoms, pain, emotion and social aspects.</P>
<P>For the SF-36 subscales there appeared to be a general improvement of cilostazol over placebo. For the WIQ, there was no improvement of cilostazol over placebo for the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 1999</LINK> study, but there was a reported 20% increase in walking speed for the cilostazol group in the <LINK REF="STD-Money-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Money 1998</LINK> study. COM results were only reported for the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 1999</LINK> study, and showed modest improvements across the domains. The VascuQol questionnaire was only utilised in the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK> study and the cilostazol group showed improvements over placebo for the activity, pain and emotional domains.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Strandness-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strandness 2002</LINK> study also reported on quality of life, with inadequate numerical data to support, but mentioned greater improvement in the cilostazol groups, compared with placebo, in the physical function, role-physical and bodily pain scales. <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_95_x002d_201" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-95-201</LINK> only briefly indicated no difference between the two groups for the endpoint quality of life, but the authors did not indicate which questionnaires were used. <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_98_x002d_213" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-98-213</LINK> reported a statistically significant difference at 12 weeks, favouring cilostazol, compared with placebo, but no data was reported.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included fifteen double-blind, RCTs with a total of 3718 participants with intermittent claudication in this review. The results from the meta-analysis indicate that cilostazol improves both initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD) over placebo. Few studies were included comparing cilostazol to pentoxifylline, so any conclusions drawn regarding this association should be done guardedly. Reviewing the results of the studies not included in the meta-analysis showed a less clear result, with a variability of positive and negative data regarding cilostazol and its effects on ICD and ACD. However, these studies were not included in the meta-analysis due to large variations in reporting that would make direct comparisons inappropriate. Cilostazol significantly improved ankle brachial index (ABI) over placebo, but there was no difference found between cilostazol and pentoxifylline. There were very few deaths in any of the studies, and the meta-analyses found no differences in all-cause mortality for any of the treatment comparisons. Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke) were reported in only a single study, with few events that were fairly even between the treatment groups. More data would be needed to understand the association between cilostazol and cardiovascular events. For adverse events, participants in the cilostazol treatment groups had a greater odds of experiencing headaches, diarrhoea, abnormal stool, dizziness and palpitations than placebo or pentoxifylline, but were possibly less likely to experience pain symptoms. While participants in the cilostazol group did experience more adverse events, these symptoms were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved with symptomatic treatment without requiring cessation of therapy.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review addressed whether the use of cilostazol reduced symptoms of intermittent claudication (specifically ICD and ACD) in participants with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). All 15 included studies evaluated the effects of cilostazol compared with placebo, within similar study populations. However, due to the lack of consistency in reporting of clear data, seven studies could not be utilised for comparison in the ICD and ACD meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Brass-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brass 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Albuquerque-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Albuquerque 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_86_x002d_103" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-86-103</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_87_x002d_101" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-87-101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_94_x002d_301" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-94-301</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_98_x002d_213" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-98-213</LINK> could be used for ACD analysis, but not ICD. The inability to use these studies for direct comparison reduces the thoroughness of this review. Attempts were made to contact study authors and sponsors to obtain further information. The seven studies that were included in the meta-analyses for ICD and ACD (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Money-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Money 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsuka-Study-21_x002d_95_x002d_201" TYPE="STUDY">Otsuka Study 21-95-201</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strandness-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strandness 2002</LINK>) did allow robust associations to be derived for the ICD and ACD outcomes, specifically for the treatment comparison of cilostazol 100 mg twice daily versus placebo. These results should be interpreted with the consideration that seven studies evaluating the same issue could not be included in the meta-analyses results.</P>
<P>The ability of the included studies to assess both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity is limited by the few events reported, resulting in inadequate power to assess these outcomes. Also, treatment duration ranged from six to 26 weeks, with the most common treatment time at 24 weeks. Most of the included studies only reported change from baseline for the final time-point, so we are currently unable to compare studies at a common time-point. Treadmill protocols ranged between three main protocols. The abberations between the testing protocols were addressed by using change in mean walking distances, rather than absolute follow-up distance, which does not account for baseline. These differences and limitations alter the strength of the applicability of the evidence, and should be kept in mind when interpreting the findings.</P>
<P>Only two of the included studies defined their baseline treadmill test values when multiple baseline values were obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Brass-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brass 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2000</LINK>). Both studies used the highest baseline treadmill value for analysis, while the remaining studies did not indicate their methods. Possible variations in treadmill testing baseline definition could reduce the applicability of the findings.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the electronic search results we included 15 studies, with a total of 3718 participants. The quality of the studies was low to moderate, with most of the studies not adequately reporting on randomisation of sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding. Also, many studies did not report on outcomes set out in their methods, possibly indicating a high risk of reporting bias. Furthermore, seven of the 15 studies did not present data on ICD and ACD in a form which could be used for direct comparison, limiting the robustness of the results of this review. The inability to compare these studies confuses the overall findings of the meta-analyses, making associations difficult to determine.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study selection and data extraction was performed independently by two authors in order to minimise bias in the review process. The inclusion and exclusion criteria set out in the protocol were strictly adhered to in order to limit subjectivity. All participants randomised in a study were used in our analyses to reduce bias from subjective definitions of intention-to-treat used by study authors. There was the possibility of imputation for the seven studies whose data was not in a readily available format for inclusion in meta-analysis, but after consultation with a statistician this was not done in order to reduce large scale subjectivity being introduced into the study results.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Brass-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brass 2012</LINK> study provided data on adverse events in percentages, which were converted to number of participants in order to use in analyses. For the <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 2000</LINK> study there were standard deviations provided for the ABI outcome for mean change for the comparison between cilostazol and placebo, but not for cilostazol compared to pentoxifylline. Correlation coefficients were calculated using the existing mean change standard deviations and imputed to calculate mean change standard deviations for the comparison between cilostazol and pentoxifylline. Other forms of imputation were avoided due to large differences between the studies and their methods of reporting results.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Pratt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt 2001</LINK> study reviewed data from the cilostazol safety database, representing eight RCTs. However, it was unclear which eight trials were evaluated, so it cannot be determined if they are similar to the studies in our review. The <LINK REF="REF-Pratt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt 2001</LINK> review found similar results regarding adverse effects that we found: participants taking cilostazol had an increased risk of headache, diarrhoea, abnormal stool, dizziness and palpitations, and a decreased risk of pain, compared with participants taking placebo or pentoxifylline. The <LINK REF="REF-Pratt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt 2001</LINK> review also found very few reports of cardiovascular events, which we also noted, with only a single study reporting.</P>
<P>A systematic review published in 2002 evaluated the effects of cilostazol on walking distances and health related quality of life measures, using six studies that were also included in our review (<LINK REF="REF-Regensteiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regensteiner 2002</LINK>). Although this study analysed data in a different manner, they also concluded increased ICDs and ACDs in the participants taking cilostazol compared with those taking placebo. The <LINK REF="REF-Regensteiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regensteiner 2002</LINK> review found an increase in WIQ scores and most SF-36 subscale scores for the participants taking cilostazol compared to placebo. Our study did not perform any compilation of quality of life scores, so we cannot directly comment on the similarity to our results.</P>
<P>Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>), published in 2002 investigating the role of cilostazol in increasing walking distances and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication, used similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as our review and included eight studies in their analysis that were also used in ours. For their analysis they did not include all participants randomised, but rather the modified intention-to-treat population accounting for withdrawals and incomplete treadmill testing. It should be kept in mind when making direct comparisons with our results that the <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK> review reported percentage change from baseline, rather than weighted mean change in metres. For ICD (reported as pain-free walking distance) the placebo-treated group had a 40% change from baseline increase, and the cilostazol-treated groups experienced a 60% increase from baseline for the 50 mg twice daily group, and 67% for the 100 mg twice daily group. Both cilostazol groups were statistically significantly greater compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.05). For ACD (reported as maximal walking distance) there were statistically significant increases in the cilostazol 50 mg and 100 mg twice daily treatment groups compared with the placebo-treated group, 44%, 50% and 21.4%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The results for ICD and ACD in <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK> are similar to our own findings. Two trials in the <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK> review compared pentoxifylline to placebo, and found no difference between the two groups. Also, similar to our review, there was increased headache, diarrhoea and abnormal stools in the cilostazol-treated groups. Finally, quality of life results showed improvement in the cilostazol group for the SF-36 physical function subscale, as well as for the role-physical and bodily pain subscales, and for WIQ there were improvements in both walking distance and speed for the cilostazol treatment groups.</P>
<P>A systematic review published in 2012 comparing cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate and pentoxifylline to placebo for the treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with PAD included six of the same studies as our review (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2012</LINK>). For inclusion in meta-analysis the study authors employed imputation techniques that we ourselves did not use and they reported their findings for ICD (reported as maximum walking distance) and ACD (reported as pain-free walking distance) as geometric mean changes compared with placebo. However, their results also found increases in both ICD and ACD for the cilostazol groups, compared with placebo, with an increase in ICD of 25% (95% credible interval 11% to 40%) and an ACD increase of 13% (95% credible interval 2% to 26%). Adverse events were not reported in the meta-analysis, but headaches and gastrointestinal issues that were mild were noted in the intervention arms and there was no increase in cardiovascular events or deaths for cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate or pentoxifylline. The authors noted that the heterogeneity of quality of life reporting did not allow them to report those findings in their review. This data is also presented as part of <LINK REF="REF-Squires-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squires 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Squires-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squires 2011</LINK> as technology assessment reports written for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Although the data supports the use of cilostazol for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with PAD, as well as pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate, current NICE guidelines only recommend naftidrofuryl as treatment in this population (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The NICE guidelines were also based on cost-effectiveness data, which was not evaluated in our own review.</P>

<P>Cilostazol, 50 mg to 100 mg twice daily, has been shown to improve walking distances compared with placebo, and the adverse side effect profile is limited to conditions that are mild and often treatable. Cilostazol can be considered as an option for claudicants whom conservative or interventional treatments have failed to sufficiently alleviate their symptoms. However, cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with congestive cardiac failure due to its mechanism of action as a phosphodiesterase enzyme III inhibitor. Cilostazol is also contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>). There is insufficient data at this time to comment on whether treatment with cilostazol results in a reduction of adverse cardiovascular events or mortality, or its superiority to pentoxifylline.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:20:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research on cilostazol for the treatment of intermittent claudication should ideally be performed such that comparisons can be made with other studies. Currently, there is little consensus with treatment duration, treadmill test protocol, and outcome measurement/reporting, which inhibits direct comparisons. This is apparent in this review with the significant number of studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis due to outcome reporting being inconsistent, and other variations making imputation inappropriate. Also, further studies in relation to the impact of cilostazol on quality of life, and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events are required, as well as its comparison to other antiplatelet therapies, such as pentoxifylline.</P>

<P>The previous review version required the types of participants to be "Patients with stable intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage II) for more than six months..." In order to be as inclusive as possible we have changed the requirement to "Patients with stable intermittent claudication (determined by a physician or investigator)."</P>
<P>The title of the review has been changed from 'Cilostazol for peripheral arterial disease' to 'Cilostazol for intermittent claudication' in order to reflect the change in methods, in which included patients were 'patients with intermittent claudication or patients undergoing bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease' was changed to only be 'patients with intermittent claudication'. This was done because patients undergoing surgery generally would have a more advanced disease stage than those with intermittent claudication, introducing bias and heterogeneity to the review. At the time of this update, no studies were included that included patients undergoing surgery, so no major changes had to be made. The originally planned subgroup analysis investigating differences between participants having intermittent claudication versus participants undergoing vascular surgical intervention is no longer relevant and has been removed.</P>

<P>The Cochrane review of cilostazol (1/2007) includes only one study of cilostazol (CLZ) and pentoxifylline (PTX, TRENTAL), (Dawson DL 2000), and states: the differences in ICD and ACD showed significant improvement for the cilostazol group over patients taking pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>Already in 1998 eight pivotal trials with cilostazol were analysed in the medical review by the FDA. One of these was trial 21-94-301 (P. 58), an unpublished trial of Otsuka with 370 patients: 247 CLZ or placebo, 123 pentoxifylline. In this study CLZ was not statistically distinguishable from either placebo or oxpentifylline (= pentoxyfylline). A second study comparing cilostazol with pentoxifylline was the Dawson DL 2000 (trial 21-96-202). The FDA states (p.231): There is not yet a convincing basis with which to conclude that CLZ is more efficious than pentoxifylline in this regard (anti claudication efficacy).</P>
<P>Pentoxifylline is not recommended for claudication in some guidelines (SIGN 10/2006, CHEST 2/2007), therefore it is important to note that there is no difference between CLZ and PTX.</P>
<P>In a reply (21 March 2007) to my mail (23 February 2007) to the Cochrane peripheral vascular diseases group Prof. Stansby stated that "the medical review (of the FDA) does not come up if you put cilostazol into the FDA web page search".</P>
<P>This Cochrane review was published at the same time as marketing of cilostazol started in Germany and was part of the promotional material Schwarz Pharma sent to us. Prof. Stansby declared a conflict of interest with Otsuka pharmaceuticals, the developing company. For me this may be a problem. What does Cochrane think about it?</P>
<P>Submitter agrees with default conflict of interest statement:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>We agree that there appears to be an additional and unpublished trial comparing cilostazol with pentoxifylline, referred to as study 21-94-301 in the FDA document of 1998. We were unaware of this when we prepared our original review. It did not come to light using standard search strategies. Unfortunately the data currently available to us is still not sufficient to allow inclusion of this trial at present. Otsuka have not made the data available to us, although it has been requested. The review has been altered to make it clear that this additional study exists and that any conclusions about a comparison with pentoxifylline should be guarded based on the one published trial. If in the future Otsuka do release further data to us, and the methodological quality is acceptable, we will consider including it in future updates. </P>
<P>The production of this review and its timing was entirely coincidental to the release date of cilostazol in Germany. Likewise there was no contact with Otsuka concerning these matters. Professor Stansby has declared his conflicts of interest, but has not had any contact with Otsuka in relation to the timing and release of this review. The main conclusions of the review are not altered by this additional trial but we have updated the review to include this study under "excluded studies".</P>
