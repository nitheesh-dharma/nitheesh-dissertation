<P>
<B>What is urinary schistosomiasis and how is it treated?</B>
</P>
<P>Urinary schistosomiasis is a disease caused by infection of people with the parasitic worm <I>Schistosoma haematobium</I>. These worms live in blood vessels around the infected person's bladder and the worm releases eggs which are released in the person's urine. If the urine is passed into ponds or lakes, the eggs can hatch and infect people that are washing or swimming there. Infection can cause blood in the urine and if left untreated can eventually lead to anaemia, malnutrition, kidney failure, or bladder cancer. Urinary schistosomiasis is diagnosed by looking for worm eggs in the urine.</P>
<P>The disease occurs mainly in school-aged children and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The drug currently recommended for treatment is praziquantel, which can be given as a single dose, but other drugs such as metrifonate, artesunate, and mefloquine have also been evaluated.</P>
<P>After examining the research published up to 23th May 2014, we included 30 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 8165 children and adults.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the research say?</B>
</P>
<P>On average, the standard dose of praziquantel cures around 60% of people at one to two months after treatment (<I>high quality evidence</I>), and reduces the number of schistosome eggs in the urine by over 95% (<I>high quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Metrifonate, an older drug no longer in use, had little effect when given as a single dose but an improved effect when given as multiple doses two weeks apart. Two trials compared three doses of metrifonate with the single dose of praziquantel and found similar effects.</P>
<P>Two more recent trials evaluated a combination of artesunate and praziquantel compared to praziquantel alone. In one trial artesunate improved cure and in one it made no difference.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Future treatments for schistosomiasis could include combining praziquantel with metrifonate, or with artesunate, but these need to be evaluated in high quality trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by an intravascular infection with parasitic <I>Schistosoma haematobium </I>worms. The adult worms typically migrate to the venous plexus of the human bladder and excrete eggs which the infected person passes in their urine. Chronic infection can cause substantial morbidity and long-term complications as the eggs become trapped in human tissues causing inflammation and fibrosis. We summarised evidence of drugs active against the infection. This is new edition of a review first published in 1997.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-29 13:45:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-07 14:24:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS and reference lists of articles up to 23 May 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antischistosomal drugs and drug combinations compared to placebo, no intervention, or each other.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-29 13:54:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two researchers independently screened the records, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. The primary efficacy outcomes were parasitological failure (defined as the continued presence of <I>S. haematobium</I> eggs in the urine at time points greater than one month after treatment), and percent reduction of egg counts from baseline. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), and continuous data as mean difference (MD), alongside their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate we combined trials in meta analyses or tables. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-04 18:18:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 30 RCTs enrolling 8165 participants in this review. Twenty-four trials were conducted in children in sub-Saharan Africa, and 21 trials were over 20 years old. Many studies were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias due to inadequate descriptions of study methods.</P>
<P>
<I>Praziquantel</I>
</P>
<P>On average, a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel reduced the proportion of people still excreting eggs in their urine by around 60% compared to placebo at one to two months after treatment (treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59, 864 participants, seven trials, <I>high quality evidence</I>). The proportion of people cured with praziquantel varied substantially between trials, from 22.5% to 83.3%, but was higher than 60% in five of the seven trials. At one to two months following praziquantel treatment at 40 mg/kg, the mean number of schistosome eggs in the urine was reduced by over 95% in five out of six trials (678 participants, six trials, <I>high quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Splitting praziquantel 40 mg/kg into two doses over 12 hours probably has no benefits over a single dose, and in a single trial of 220 participants the split dose caused more vomiting (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86) and dizziness (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94).</P>
<P>
<I>Metrifonate</I>
</P>
<P>A single dose of metrifonate 10 mg/kg reduced egg excretion (210 participants, one trial, at eight months), but was only marginally better than placebo at achieving cure at one month (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94, 142 participants, one trial).<I> </I>In a single trial comparing one, two and three doses, the absolute number of participants cured improved from 47% after one dose to 81% after three doses (93 participants, one trial, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Two small trials compared 40 mg/kg single dose praziquantel with two or three doses of 10 mg/kg metrifonate and found no clear evidence of differences in cure (metrifonate 2 x 10 mg/kg at one month: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.34, 72 participants, one trial; metrifonate 3 x 10 mg/kg at three months: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57, 100 participants, one trial. In one trial both drugs performed badly and in one trial both performed well.</P>
<P>
<I>Other drugs</I>
</P>
<P>Three trials have evaluated the antimalarial artesunate;<B> </B>with inconsistent results. Substantial antischistosomal effects were only seen in one of the three trials, which was at unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting of the trial methods. Similarly, another anti-malarial mefloquine has been evaluated in two small trials with inconsistent effects.</P>
<P>Adverse events were described as mild for all evaluated drugs, but adverse event monitoring and reporting was generally of low quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Praziquantel 40 mg/kg is the most studied drug for treating urinary schistosomiasis, and has the strongest evidence base.</P>
<P>Potential strategies to improve future treatments for schistosomiasis include the combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, or with antimalarial drugs with antischistosomal properties such as artesunate and mefloquine. Evaluation of these combinations requires rigorous, adequately powered trials using standardized outcome measures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-07 15:45:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Urinary schistosomiasis, also called bilharzia or snail fever, is an intravascular infection caused by parasitic <I>Schistosoma haematobium </I>worms. It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 243 million people required treatment for schistosomiasis in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>), and more than 700 million people live in endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The WHO currently recommends regular chemoprophylaxis with praziquantel for populations at risk to prevent the long term consequences of infection. These programmes usually target school children (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), but may be extended to the whole community in high risk settings (<LINK REF="REF-King-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2011</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-07 15:45:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Human infection with <I>S. haematobium</I> is acquired through contact with water bodies containing cercariae, the larval form of the parasite. The cercariae are able to penetrate human skin and migrate via blood vessels to the liver, where they mature into male and female forms for reproduction. Typically, they then migrate further to the venous plexus of the urinary bladder, and begin to produce eggs which the infected person excretes in their urine (<LINK REF="REF-Gryseels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gryseels 2006</LINK>). If these eggs reach water, they hatch into miracidia, infect specific freshwater snails which act as intermediate hosts, before emerging as cercariae that can infect humans (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Any illness associated with acute infection is typically mild, but chronic schistosomiasis can cause considerable morbidity with chronic pain, anaemia, fatigue, under nutrition and reduced exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>). A review of 124 observational studies and 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2005 estimated that up to 15% of people infected with any form of schistosomiasis suffer disabling long-term complications (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>). The main pathological process occurs when schistosome eggs become trapped in the tissue around the bladder and ureters causing chronic inflammation, which may obstruct the ureters, damage the kidneys, and lead to bladder cancer.<I> </I>Occasionally, eggs can become trapped in other tissues such as the brain and spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two-thirds of all infected persons are schoolchildren (aged five to 14 years), and the intensity of infection with <I>S. haematobium </I>is highest in children aged ten to 14 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard test for urinary schistosomiasis is urine filtration and microscopic examination of the urine sample (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). The urine sample is passed through a filter paper and the eggs retained on the filter are counted either with or without staining. Sedimentation and centrifugation is less commonly used for urine concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2003</LINK>). High urine egg counts are related to high infection intensity.</P>
<P>Parasitologists define cure when eggs can no longer be detected in one or more urine samples using standard methods. Besides parasitological cure, researchers also record the relative reduction in egg output after treatment compared to pre-treatment levels. This outcome, expressed as % egg reduction, is an indirect estimate of a reduction of the worm burden (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood and protein excretion in the urine is usually elevated in urinary schistosomiasis and decreases when the infection resolves. The most commonly used test is a dipstick test. Ultrasound can demonstrate organ involvement of the urinary tract as well as its resolution.  </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Praziquantel is the current treatment for urinary schistosomiasis recommended by the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Historically, metrifonate was also used but this fell out of favour due to the need for multiple doses (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). More recently, there has been interest in the antischistosomal properties of artemisinin derivates and mefloquine, more commonly used for treating malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Praziquantel is an pyrazinoisoquinoline derivative with activity against adult worms of all schistosome species (<I>S. mansoni</I>, <I>S. intercalatum</I> and <I>S. japonicum</I>), but not against maturing worms. Praziquantel has a rapid onset of action. It is well-tolerated, can be given as a single dose (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>) and paediatric formulations are available (<LINK REF="REF-Stothard-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stothard 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Metrifonate, an organophosphorous cholinesterase inhibitor, is active against <I>S. haematobium</I> but not against other schistosome species (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Artemisinin, extensively used as potent antimalarial, has highest activity against immature schistosomes. Artemsinins are safe and well-tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After treatment with praziquantel, the worms appear to die quickly but egg excretion continues for several weeks. There are several possible reasons for this:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly, some worms might not have been mature at the time of praziquantel treatment and therefore not killed by praziquantel (<LINK REF="REF-Cioli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cioli 2003</LINK>). Maturation of the worms after infection takes four to six weeks, and after two months eggs can be detected in the urine.</LI>
<LI>Secondly, the patient might have been re-infected (<LINK REF="REF-Cioli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cioli 2003</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Thirdly, dead eggs still wander out of the tissue into the urine several weeks after clearing adult worms (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988-ZWE" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988 ZWE</LINK>). Therefore, a follow-up four to six weeks after treatment is useful (<LINK REF="REF-Renganathan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renganathan 1998</LINK>). There is also considerable variation in daily urinary egg output (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although there is concern that <I>S. haematobium</I> might develop resistance against praziquantel (<LINK REF="REF-Fenwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenwick 2006</LINK>), there is no clinically relevant evidence for resistance up to now (<LINK REF="REF-Doenhoff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doenhoff 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In endemic settings, reinfection with <I>S. haematobium</I> is likely, and cure (often defined as complete cessation of egg excretion) is not a sustainable long term goal. However, reduction of infection intensity results in clinical improvement, low morbidity and prevention of long term complications. Therefore, WHO promotes morbidity control rather than cure as an objective for schistosomiasis control programmes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, praziquantel as the only drug in use that is exposed to resistance development. It is therefore important to monitor its performance and to assess the effects of other drugs against urinary schistosomiasis.  </P>
<P>Dosing regimens for subgroups such as highly infected patient groups, incremental benefits of drug combinations, double dosing and optimal interval between doses have to be determined to inform control programmes for urinary schistosomiasis.</P>
<P>Paediatric schistosomiasis has gained attention as a public health problem, and evaluation of existing treatment studies is indicated.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Praziquantel 40 mg/kg single dose versus placebo (comparison 1)</HEADING>
<P>
<I>On average, a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel reduces the proportion of people still excreting eggs at one to two months after treatment by around 60% compared to placebo, and reduces the mean number of eggs excreted by over 95%.</I>
</P>
<P>Eight trials compared a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel with placebo or no treatment in schoolchildren in sub-Saharan Africa. We have listed the definitions of parasitological failure in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Parasitological failure</HEADING>
<P>Praziquantel 40 mg/kg as a single dose reduced parasitological treatment failure by around 60% at one to two months compared to placebo (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; 864 participants, seven trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The absolute level of treatment failure with praziquantel ranged from 16.6% (<LINK REF="STD-McMahon-1979-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 1979 TZA</LINK>) to 77.5% (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jonge-1990-SDN" TYPE="STUDY">de Jonge 1990 SDN</LINK>). Treatment failure with placebo was greater than 80% in all seven trials and over 90% in four trials.</P>
<P>Four trials reported follow-up beyond two months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Failure rate increased over time in two trials, as might be expected in areas of schistosomiasis transmission as people become re-infected (<LINK REF="STD-McMahon-1979-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 1979 TZA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugh-1983-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Pugh 1983 MWI</LINK>). However, treatment outcomes improved in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988-ZWE" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988 ZWE</LINK> over time, with moderate reductions in treatment failure at one month and three months and a 70% reduction at six months. The trial authors stated that this improvement might have been due to excretion of remaining eggs from the urinary tract over time.</P>
<P>The fourth trial, <LINK REF="STD-de-Jonge-1990-SDN" TYPE="STUDY">de Jonge 1990 SDN</LINK>, found no difference in treatment failure between praziquantel and placebo at any time point. The trial authors used a more sensitive diagnostic method (three urine samples, filtration of the whole volume up to 350 mL when the 10 mL urine sample contained fewer than 10 eggs) and a strict definition of cure (no excretion of eggs, no viability testing of eggs). This may explain the high failure rates observed despite high percent egg reductions comparable to other trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-1989-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 1989 KEN</LINK> reported treatment failure at eight months, its only time point. A single dose of praziquantel reduced treatment failure by 86% compared to placebo (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.22; 209 participants, one trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six trials reported parasitological failure stratified by intensity of infection; the categorisation of strata varied between trials (642 participants, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). At the first follow-up at four to six weeks, three out of four trials had a tendency to higher failure in participants with higher infection intensity. The pattern attenuated at later time points.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Percent egg reduction</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials reported mean urine egg counts per 10 mL urine at baseline, and at one to two months after a single dose of praziquantel 40 mg/kg or placebo (867 participants, seven trials, see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), although we were only able to reliably interpret this data for six trials (678 participants).</P>
<P>The mean egg count was reduced by more than 95% at one to two months following praziquantel in five trials, and by 75% in one trial. In the placebo groups the change in mean egg count ranged from a 53% decrease to a 115% increase.</P>
<P>Percent egg reduction in the praziquantel group remained high (&gt; 95%) in all three trials reporting at three months, and in all four trials at six months. Percent egg reduction was variable in the placebo group, ranging from 26% increase to 54% reduction at three months and from 5% to 64% reduction at six months (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). One additional trial, <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-1989-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 1989 KEN</LINK>, reported percent egg reduction at eight months as its only time point (209 participants, see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Percent egg reduction after praziquantel was 99% compared to 5% with placebo.</P>
<P>Five trials reported percent egg reduction stratified by intensity of infection (764 participants, <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). At four to six weeks, all trials reported percent egg reductions over 90% across the strata. Percent egg reduction as a relative measure was at least as high in heavy infections as in mild infections, but post-treatment egg counts as an absolute measure tended to be higher in people with high intensity infections. This pattern persisted at later time points.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical resolution</HEADING>
<P>At eight weeks the proportion of patients with persistent haematuria (defined as &gt; 5 erythrocytes/mL) was lower in those given praziquantel than placebo in one small trial which reported this (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84; 119 participants, one trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There were substantial reductions in the mean number of erythrocytes in the urine in three trials at one to two months, but we could not combine these data in a meta-analysis (357 participants, three trials, see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Proteinuria was reduced by 65% to 84% at one to two months after praziquantel compared to increases in the placebo groups (238 participants, two trials, see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported mean haemoglobin at baseline and at six to eight months after treatment with no difference between groups (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.09; 727 participants, two trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials measured a variety of growth parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Befidi-Mengue-1992-CMR" TYPE="STUDY">Befidi Mengue 1992 CMR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olds-1999-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 1999 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-1989-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 1989 KEN</LINK>).

The third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-1989-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 1989 KEN</LINK>) reports 14 measures, some of which are reported as statistically significant, but all appear to be of no or only borderline clinical importance (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Most notably, there is a reported increase in children's physical fitness as measured by the Harvard Step test. The difference in mean improvement between groups was 6.8% at five weeks (mean end scores 81.2% praziquantel versus 75.5% placebo). Scores between 68% and 82% are considered average. Children that took praziquantel also gained 1.2 kg more weight than those in the control group, however baseline differences between groups were of a similar magnitude to this effect.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Of nine trials, six (with 1286 participants) commented on adverse events. Only four described the methods used for data collection, but rarely reported them in detail (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). Adverse events were usually monitored in the first days after medication. Only two trials actually reported numbers of adverse events, and only abdominal pain was reported by both trials. The absolute number of adverse events was low and none were more common with praziquantel than placebo (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The other trials summarized narratively with comments such as "both treatments were well tolerated" (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Praziquantel 40 mg/kg versus lower doses (comparison 2)</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Praziquantel doses of 20 to 40 mg/kg result in similar reductions in mean egg excretion, but 40 mg/kg is marginally superior at achieving cure. </I>
</P>
<P>Ten trials compared praziquantel 40 mg/kg with lower doses: 30 mg/kg (seven trials), 20 mg/kg (three trials), and 10 mg/kg (three trials). All trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa in schoolchildren, apart from one trial, which recruited college students and army recruits.</P>
<P>Treatment with praziquantel 40 mg/kg had fewer treatment failures than lower doses when measured at four to six weeks after treatment (versus 30 mg/kg; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.99; 401 participants, four trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, versus 20 mg/kg; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; 338 participants, two trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, there was no difference between 40 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg at two to three months (517 participants, five trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), or six months after treatment (699 participants, six trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the five trials comparing praziquantel 40 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, the mean number of eggs excreted was reduced by greater than 90% with both doses and without significant differences between groups (495 participants, five trials, see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>In trials comparing 40 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, again the mean number of eggs excreted was reduced by more than 95% for both doses and differences in percent egg reduction appeared small (636 participants, four trials, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On average, a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel reduced the proportion of people still excreting <I>S. haematobium</I> eggs in their urine by around 60% compared to placebo at one to two months after treatment (<I>high quality evidence</I>), and reduced the mean number of schistosome eggs in the urine by over 95% in five out of six trials (<I>high quality evidence</I>). Splitting praziquantel 40 mg/kg into two doses over 12 hours probably has no benefits over a single dose.</P>
<P>Two small trials compared a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel with two or three doses of 10 mg/kg metrifonate and found no differences in cure. In one trial both drugs performed badly and in one trial both performed well.</P>
<P>Three trials evaluated the antimalarial artesunate, and two trials evaluated mefloquine,<B> </B>with inconsistent results.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The WHO currently recommend that schistosomiasis is treated with a single dose of praziquantel of at least 40 mg/kg (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). In this review we found no trials evaluating doses higher than 40 mg in urinary schistosomiasis, but doses of 40 mg/kg or even 30 mg/kg are effective at reducing egg excretion and achieving cure.</P>
<P>Of all the drugs that have been evaluated for treating urinary schistosomiasis, praziquantel has by far the strongest evidence base. It has been evaluated across a wide range of endemic countries, and most trials were conducted in children who bear the highest burden of disease. However, few trials included children younger than five years of age, and <LINK REF="REF-Stothard-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stothard 2013</LINK> suggested that higher doses of praziquantel might be required for this group. We would have liked to explore this possibility through an analysis stratified by age, but the data did not allow this and no firm conclusions can be made. In addition, most trials concentrated on parasitological efficacy, and few reported clinical outcomes such as improvement in haematuria or anaemia. Data on resolution of long-term morbidity after treatment, as nutritional outcomes and sonographic findings are very rare, and follow-up is limited to less than one year.</P>
<P>The absolute proportion of people cured by praziquantel varied between trials while percent egg reduction was relatively homogenous. This may be explained by low sensitivity and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test, compounded with the fact that egg yield varies during the day and with physical activity. This means that patients with few eggs in their urine may be variably declared as positive or negative in different settings. The proportional reduction in the mean egg counts from before to after treatment is less prone to this error. It also appears that some trials based post-treatment egg reduction on the whole trial population (including cured patients with zero egg counts), while other trials based the post-treatment calculations on those patients still excreting eggs. We were unable to combine egg reduction values in meta-analysis, and assess statistical significance, due to the poor reporting of standard deviations and methods for calculating the mean (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the included trials suggested drug resistance as a possible cause of high parasitological failure, or of recurrent schistosomiasis over prolonged follow-up. In high transmission areas two mechanisms could explain rising parasitological failure over time: maturation of immature worms (which escape the action of praziquantel) to egg producing adults, and reinfection.</P>
<P>Previously the WHO also recommended metrifonate at 7.5 mg/kg for three doses (given two weeks apart), but this drug is now largely unavailable (<LINK REF="REF-Danso_x002d_Appiah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danso-Appiah 2008</LINK>). We found some evidence that repeated doses of metrifonate had reasonable antischistosomal effects but we found no trials directly comparing this dose with the standard dose of praziquantel. Combining praziquantel with metrifonate is one possible strategy for improving parasitological cure as they attack <I>S. haematobium</I> by different mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>). However, we only found one small trial evaluating a combination approach and this used a low dose of praziquantel rather than the standard 40 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-1987-GMB" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 1987 GMB</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antimalarials (such as artesunate and mefloquine) given alone or in combination with praziquantel are another potential future treatment option, but the current evidence base is limited to a few trials with inconsistent results. As many locations in sub-Saharan Africa are co-endemic for schistosomiasis and malaria, there are also concerns about development of <I>Plasmodium</I> parasite resistance to artemisinins, especially as they would be used in a single dose and without a companion antimalarial drug (<LINK REF="REF-Utzinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utzinger 2004</LINK>). Any change in policy would need to fully consider this potential public health harm.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality for the evidence. </P>
<P>We consider the evidence for substantial benefits with praziquantel compared to placebo to be of high quality, meaning we have confidence in this result. Many of the included trials are old, but reassuringly the findings of the most recent trial conducted in 2005/2006 are consistent with the older studies.</P>
<P>However, we consider most of the evidence for other comparisons in this review to be of low or even very low quality. Most of the trials evaluating metrifonate are old and precede guidelines on transparent reporting of clinical trials. As such, many trials lacked adequate descriptions of methods to allow judgements on risk of bias, and so risk of bias has been classified as unclear. Trials were also generally small and underpowered to reliably detect or exclude effects.</P>
<P>Of the three trials reporting on the antischistosomal effects of artesunate, only one was at low risk of bias and this trial found little effect with artesunate compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2001-GAB" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2001 GAB</LINK>). Although the metanalysis suggests artesunate may improve cure when added to praziquantel, this evidence was of low quality due to inconsistency between trials, and the single trial showing a large effect being at unclear risk of bias for all domains.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-06-29 13:38:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our information specialist followed a detailed, reproducible search strategy, and we searched reference lists of included trials. However, some trials might not be available online, and therefore an electronic search will not identify them. </P>
<P>In many cases, clarification of information with authors was not possible as no contact e-mail addresses were available as the trials were very old.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two recent systematic reviews evaluated the use of artemisinins in treating urinary schistosomiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-P_x00e9_rez-del-Villar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pérez del Villar 2012</LINK>), and both concluded that the combination of artesunate plus praziquantel is superior to praziquantel alone, While we find some evidence to support this we conclude that this evidence is only of low quality and encourage further high quality and adequately powered trials before any change in treatment policy. Of note, the trial at lowest risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2001-GAB" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2001 GAB</LINK>), found no significant difference in cure between artesunate alone and placebo, or between praziquantel plus artesunate and praziquantel alone.</P>
<P>One further systematic review evaluated single or repeated doses of praziquantel, and found no evidence of benefit with repeated dosing compared to a single dose in people with <I>S. haematobium</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-King-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2011</LINK>). We would agree that repeating doses two or three weeks apart does not seem to provide benefit over a single dose based on two trials with 686 participants. However, repeating doses at three monthly intervals over two years did seem to provide some additional benefits in a single small trial and further trials could evaluate this.</P>

<P>Praziquantel is the most studied drug for treating urinary schistosomiasis and has the strongest evidence base. Although there is some evidence that 30 mg/kg may be sufficient, operationally this would prove difficult as 40 mg/kg is used to treat people with intestinal schistosomiasis, and the two diseases often overlap.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-24 23:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential strategies to improve future treatments for schistosomiasis include the combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, or with antimalarials with antischistosomal properties such as artesunate and mefloquine. Evaluation of these combinations requires rigorous. adequately powered trials using standardized outcome measures. It is both important and urgent that these parameters be agreed upon and applied. Trial protocols with standardised diagnostic methods, time points of follow-up and efficacy outcomes would enable us to combine trials in meta-analysis and to reduce heterogeneity between trials.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-07-07 15:41:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>While inclusion criteria of the first protocol included all RCTs which studied antischistosomal drugs, we decided to change the protocol. We excluded trials which evaluated obsolete drugs as ambilhar, oltipraz and niridazole. We also excluded studies which compared a combination of praziquantel and albendazole to placebo only, as this comparison is not of interest for this review. We included trials evaluating metronidazole.</P>
<P>We did not contact researchers or organizations looking for unpublished studies, as stated in the protocol. We did not report parasitological outcomes at three months as primary outcomes.</P>
<P>The older version of this review concluded that both metrifonate and praziquantel were effective in treating urinary schistosomiasis, even if metrifonate had operational disadvantages. As implications for further research, evaluation of different metrifonate doses and regimens and of evaluation of artemisinin drugs and of combination therapy is recommended.</P>
<P>While we agree with these conclusions, the data on egg reduction allow some further recommendations. We have newly included three trials evaluating artemisinin drugs, and one recent trial using mefloquine, and present this new evidence here.</P>
<P>Additional analysis carried out in this edition of the review, which was not in the previous edition (<LINK REF="REF-Danso_x002d_Appiah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danso-Appiah 2008</LINK>), is the presentation of egg reduction rates in summary tables.</P>

<P>Authors' conclusion: Both metrifonate and praziquantel are effective in reducing egg excretion and are both recommended for population based treatment.
