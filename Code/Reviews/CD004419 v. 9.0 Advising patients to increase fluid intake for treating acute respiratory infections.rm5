<TITLE>Advising patients to increase fluid intake for treating acute respiratory infections</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-14 17:22:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Doctors commonly recommend that people with acute respiratory infections drink extra fluids. Acute infections include colds, acute sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza. This review intended to find out the benefit or harm from this recommendation. Potential benefits of fluids are replacing fluid lost because of fever or rapid breathing, treating dehydration and reducing the viscosity of mucus. In infections of the lower part of the respiratory tract, possible harmful effects of fluids might be a dilution of the blood sodium concentration, leading to headache, confusion and seizures. This review found no evidence for or against the use of increased fluids in acute respiratory infections. No randomised controlled trials have been conducted to determine the benefit or harm from extra fluids. It is important that further studies be done in order to determine the true effect of this very common medical advice.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-01-12 10:48:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute respiratory infection is a common reason for people to present for medical care. Advice to increase fluid intake is a frequent treatment recommendation. Attributed benefits of fluids include replacing increased insensible fluid losses, correcting dehydration from reduced intake and reducing the viscosity of mucus. However, there are theoretical reasons for increased fluid intake to cause harm. Anti-diuretic hormone secretion is increased in lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies. This systematic examination of the evidence sought to determine the benefit versus harm from increasing fluid intake.</P>

<P>To answer the following questions.</P>
<P>1. Does recommending increased fluid intake as a treatment for acute respiratory infections improve duration and severity of symptoms?<BR/>2. Are there adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in people with acute respiratory infections?<BR/>3.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-15 11:18:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute respiratory infections form a large proportion of disease seen in primary care settings. Some studies estimate this as the reason for presentation in up to 15% of primary care consultations (<LINK REF="REF-Fry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 1993</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-18 09:08:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Michelle PB Guppy">
<P>Advice to increase fluid intake is a common treatment recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murtagh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murtagh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosser 1998</LINK>). This advice is given across the age ranges, from infants and children through to adults and the elderly. This advice is often non-specific in terms of quantity of fluid recommended but the usual implication is to drink more than normal. However, there is debate over what is a normal healthy fluid intake (<LINK REF="REF-Valtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valtin 2002</LINK>). The type of fluid is not usually specified but is usually confined to oral fluids normally consumed by the patient. Sometimes specific fluids are recommended, such as fruit juice, soup, lemonade and tea (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-14 17:26:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benefits from fluids are attributed to: replacing increased insensible fluid loss from fever and from respiratory tract evaporation with tachypnoea (<LINK REF="STD-Dhawan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dhawan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shann-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shann 1985</LINK>); correcting dehydration from reduced intake (<LINK REF="REF-Gerigk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerigk 1996</LINK>); reducing the viscosity of mucus (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosser 1998</LINK>); loosening nasal mucus (<LINK REF="STD-Saketkhoo-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saketkhoo 1978</LINK>) and moistening the respiratory tract to maintain comfort (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middleton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 1991</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-10-18 09:10:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Michelle PB Guppy">
<P>The main benefit from extra fluids may be to prevent or treat dehydration. However, there are potential reasons for increased fluid intake to cause harm. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is increased in lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies. Excessive ADH secretion has been reported in bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heim-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heim 1982</LINK>). The mechanism of increased ADH secretion might be due to a resetting of the osmostat (<LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1990</LINK>) or a response to the perception of hypovolaemia by intrathoracic receptors (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steensel_x002d_Moll-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steensel-Moll 1990</LINK>). Giving increased fluids (or even normal maintenance) might potentially lead to hyponatraemia and fluid overload (<LINK REF="STD-Dhawan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dhawan 1992</LINK>). There is ongoing debate about whether tonicity of replacement fluid is the more important consideration, with some advising that replacement of water and sodium is appropriate treatment for hyponatraemia in the context of hypovolaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Gerigk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerigk 1996</LINK>)</P>
<P>Given that this advice is usually generic, in that it is given to infants, children, adults and the elderly, it is likely that the physiology and fluid balance in these different groups differs markedly, particularly in different climatic environments. Therefore it is important to determine the effects of this advice across these different demographics and age ranges.</P>

<P>People of all ages with an acute respiratory infection and presenting for treatment in a primary care setting. Participant age groups include infants, children, adults and geriatrics. We considered and analysed age groups separately.</P>
<P>We subdivided acute respiratory infection into upper and lower respiratory tract infection and included the following clinical entities, as defined by the international classification of health problems in primary care (ICHPPC) (<LINK REF="REF-WONCA-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">WONCA 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)</B>

<P>This included the ICHPPC-defined conditions: acute upper respiratory tract infection (cold, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis), acute sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, acute laryngitis and tracheitis. There had to be an absence of abnormal chest signs to define these conditions.</P>
<P>
<B>Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)</B>
</P>
<P>This included the ICHPPC-defined conditions: acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis (which includes tracheobronchitis) and pneumonia.</P>
<P>We defined influenza according to two ICHPPC categories. We included influenza without pneumonia as an URTI. We included influenzal pneumonia in the ICHPPC category of pneumonia and considered it as a LRTI.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this systematic review we excluded otitis media.</P>
<P>We excluded people with underlying medical conditions as their fluid requirements may differ from the normal population. We excluded people with central nervous system (CNS) infection as this alters their fluid management (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1994</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-13 21:41:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We came to this review expecting to find little research done on the topic and only evidence that fluids would be beneficial. We were therefore somewhat surprised by the observational studies we found. These raised the question of whether there may potentially be a problem with excess fluids, particularly in infections of the lower respiratory tract. Research has been done in the intensive care setting with respect to treatment with intravenous administration of fluids in severely ill children. However, research in the primary care setting is lacking. We concluded that further research is worth undertaking, particularly in the ambulatory primary care setting, where advice to give extra fluids is common.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-14 17:26:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that there is much written about hyponatraemia in the inpatient hospital setting. The reported incidence of hyponatraemia in children admitted with pneumonia ranged from 27% (<LINK REF="REF-Singhi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhi 1992</LINK>) to 45% (<LINK REF="STD-Don-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Don 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shann-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shann 1985</LINK>) and 48% (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2005</LINK>). Debate is ongoing about appropriate fluid therapy for sick, hospitalised children in order to prevent iatrogenic hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hatherill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatherill 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holliday-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holliday 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaneko-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaneko 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moritz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moritz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Recent randomised controlled trials of isotonic versus hypotonic intravenous fluids in paediatric inpatients with various conditions provide evidence that isotonic fluid administration is associated with a lower incidence of iatrogenic hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez-Montanana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez Montanana 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yung-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2009</LINK>). These trials did not specifically look at children with respiratory tract infections.</P>
<P>The incidence of hyponatraemia at time of hospital admission in adults with community-acquired pneumonia was found to be as high as 27.9% (<LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>). Observational data suggest that initial treatment of hospitalised adults with isotonic intravenous fluids is protective against the development of hyponatraemia, and that treatment with hypotonic or no fluids increases the risk of subsequent hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>). These observational data need to be followed up with a randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>In this review we were interested in the primary care situation, because this is where the majority of people with acute respiratory infections are treated. Given that these individuals are likely to be less sick than those hospitalised with an acute respiratory infection, do the same potential benefits and adverse effects of fluids apply? Are there similar implications for fluid management in the primary care setting?</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Does recommending increased fluid intake as a treatment for acute respiratory infections improve duration and severity of symptoms?</HEADING>
<P>No RCTs were found to answer this question definitively. Further research needs to be done to determine the true benefits from recommending increased fluids in acute respiratory infections.</P>
<P>The main potential benefit from fluids would be to prevent or treat dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). We found only observational data relating to this. <LINK REF="REF-Singhi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhi 1992</LINK>, in a study of hospitalised children with pneumonia, found a 27% incidence of hyponatraemia, with 7% of these children being hypovolaemic. <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2005</LINK> suggests that fluid retention in respiratory infections may be an appropriate response to hypoxaemia in order to improve circulating blood volume. <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>, in a study of adults with pneumonia, found that nursing home residents who developed pneumonia were more likely to have hypernatraemia, possibly reflecting diminished thirst and water intake.</P>
<P>Another potential benefit is reducing the volume and viscosity of mucus. <LINK REF="STD-Saketkhoo-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saketkhoo 1978</LINK> reported that nasal mucus velocity was increased by drinking hot liquids in a small controlled trial in healthy individuals. However, <LINK REF="STD-Shim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Shim 1987</LINK> reported no change in mucus production in a controlled trial of hydration versus dehydration in participants with chronic bronchitis. Neither of these studies were performed in people with acute respiratory infections so we are unable to extrapolate the results to our study question.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Are there adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in patients with acute respiratory infections?</HEADING>
<P>No RCTs were found to answer this question definitively. Further research needs to be done to determine any true adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in acute respiratory infections.</P>
<P>Only observational data suggest potential adverse effects from recommending increased fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Breuer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dhawan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dhawan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Don-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Don 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanna-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heim-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heim 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lubitz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubitz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mor-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mor 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivers 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenow-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenow 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steensel_x002d_Moll-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steensel-Moll 1990</LINK>). A summary of these studies is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, an abridged version of which has previously been published (<LINK REF="REF-Guppy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guppy 2003</LINK>). The observational data suggest that it might be type of fluid (hypotonic), rather than quantity, that is associated with potential adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two prospective observational studies investigated the frequency of hyponatraemia in children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. <LINK REF="STD-Shann-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shann 1985</LINK> reported an incidence of 45% and <LINK REF="STD-Dhawan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dhawan 1992</LINK> reported an incidence of 31%. In an observational study of infants with bronchiolitis none were found to have hyponatraemia, despite 22 out of the 23 having elevated anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) levels (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1990</LINK>). In contrast, the frequency of hyponatraemia was reported as 21% in an observational study of infants admitted to hospital with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which included infants with bronchiolitis (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Steensel_x002d_Moll-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steensel-Moll 1990</LINK>). The symptoms of hyponatraemia were not reported. These studies were in hospitalised children. In view of this potential for water overload, fluid restriction has been recommended for children with pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Shann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shann 1995</LINK>). However, one observational study suggests only restricting fluids in children with pneumonia after correction of hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2005</LINK>). The incidence and clinical significance of these observational data for the primary care setting and implications for fluid management need to be determined with further research.</P>
<P>In their study of adults with community-acquired pneumonia, <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK> found an incidence of hyponatraemia on admission of 27.9%. Fluid intake prior to hospitalisation was not documented. Subsequently, an additional 10.5% of participants developed hyponatraemia during hospitalisation. Participants who developed hyponatraemia were more likely to have renal disease and to have received hypotonic intravenous fluids, or no intravenous fluids. Treatment with isotonic intravenous fluids on admission appeared to be strongly protective against the development of hyponatraemia. This apparent protective effect of isotonic fluids needs to be further delineated in a randomised controlled trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3<I>.</I> Are any benefits or harm related to site (upper or lower respiratory tract), or different severity of illness?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Site of infection</HEADING>
<P>No RCTs were found to answer this question. Further research needs to be done to determine if any benefit or harm from fluids is related to site of illness.</P>
<P>Observational data suggest hyponatraemia may be more commonly associated with infections of the lower respiratory tract. We have reported an association with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children. Hyponatraemia has also been associated with lower respiratory tract infections in adults, including pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Breuer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenow-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenow 1972</LINK>) and bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Heim-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heim 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two cases have been reported of symptomatic hyponatraemia in infants with upper respiratory symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lubitz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubitz 1982</LINK>). In one of these cases, the infant had been given excessive amounts of dilute oral fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1984</LINK>). However, the incidence of hyponatraemia in upper respiratory infections appears to be rare. In a study of children with RSV infection none of the infants in the upper respiratory infection group had hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Steensel_x002d_Moll-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steensel-Moll 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Severity of infection</HEADING>
<P>No RCTs were found to answer this question definitively. Further research needs to be done to determine if any benefit or harm from fluids is related to severity of illness.</P>
<P>Observational data suggest that hyponatraemia may occur more frequently with increasing severity of illness. <LINK REF="STD-Dhawan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dhawan 1992</LINK> reported that hyponatraemia was twice as common in children with severe pneumonia. <LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1988</LINK> found that impairment of water excretion in adults with pneumonia was roughly proportional to the degree of severity of pneumonia, as seen radiographically. <LINK REF="REF-Hanna-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanna 2003</LINK> reported a 33% incidence of hyponatraemia in infants admitted to intensive care with bronchiolitis and a seizure rate of 4%. However, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steensel_x002d_Moll-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steensel-Moll 1990</LINK> found in infants with RSV infection that mean sodium levels were normal and did not differ with severity of illness, despite a difference in mean ADH levels.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Singhi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhi 1992</LINK> reported prolonged hospitalisation and increased mortality, and <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2005</LINK> reported longer duration of illness in children with pneumonia and hyponatraemia, but whether this was due to the underlying disease process or the hyponatraemia is uncertain. In their study of hyponatraemia in hospitalised adults with pneumonia, <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2007</LINK> found that a greater proportion of hyponatraemic participants had a greater severity of pneumonia, with hyponatraemia on admission being associated with an increased mortality, and increased length of hospitalisation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Don-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Don 2008</LINK> studied the incidence of hyponatraemia in both hospitalised and ambulatory participants with pneumonia. They found that the presence of hyponatraemia was significantly associated with need for hospitalisation, fever and increased white blood cell count, thereby reflecting the severity of pneumonia. This study found an incidence of hyponatraemia of 42% in ambulatory outpatients with pneumonia. The hyponatraemia was generally mild, with only 5% of participants having a serum Na of &lt; 130 mmol/l.</P>
<P>We did not find any studies relating to fluid management in primary care. The significance of these data in relation to both children and adults in the primary care setting needs to be determined with further research.</P>

<P>The implications for fluid management in acute respiratory infections have not been studied in any RCTs to date. There is currently inadequate evidence for or against the advice to increase fluids in acute respiratory infections. Observational data based on hospitalised participants suggest that there may be a risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia due to increased antidiuretic hormone secretion in lower respiratory tract infections. The incidence in the primary care setting, the clinical significance of these observational data, and the implications for oral fluid management need to be determined with further research, conducted as randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
