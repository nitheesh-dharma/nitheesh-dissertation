<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 10:42:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infection of bone and soft tissues can result after bone fractures. Fractures which penetrate the skin are called 'open' or 'compound'. If the skin remains intact despite the fracture, it is called 'simple' or 'closed'. If a closed fracture is treated by a surgical operation, bacteria can contaminate the wound, and cause surgical site infection. This, and other hospital-acquired infections, can be life threatening in people following surgery for thigh and other closed long bone fractures. Antibiotics have been given routinely since the 1970s in an effort to reduce infections from bacteria such as staphylococcus. This review included 23 trials, involving a total of 8447 participants. The review found that antibiotics are effective in reducing the incidence of infection, both at the surgical-wound site and in the chest and urinary tract. The effect of a single dose of antibiotic is similar to that from multiple doses if the antibiotic chosen is active through the period from the beginning of surgery until the wound is sealed. There were too few data available to confirm the expected tendency for increased adverse drug-related events such as gut problems and skin reactions.</P>

<P>Data from 8447 participants in 23 studies were included in the analyses. In people undergoing surgery for closed fracture fixation, single dose antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67), superficial surgical site infections, urinary infections, and respiratory tract infections. Multiple dose prophylaxis had an effect of similar size on deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62), but significant effects on urinary and respiratory infections were not confirmed. Although the risk of bias in many studies as reported was unclear, sensitivity analysis showed that removal from the meta-analyses of studies at high risk of bias did not alter the conclusions. Economic modelling using data from one large trial indicated that single dose prophylaxis with ceftriaxone is a cost-effective intervention. Data for the incidence of adverse effects were very limited, but as expected they appeared to be more common in those receiving antibiotics, compared with placebo or no prophylaxis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:43:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-10 14:38:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The principles of prophylaxis against post-surgical infection were established in laboratory studies in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1961</LINK>). The administration of antibiotic prior to surgery is now widely accepted. The period of administration of prophylaxis has been reduced but the optimal duration remains uncertain. Antibiotic prophylaxis during the operative management of closed fractures has been claimed to reduce infection rates from around five per cent to less than one per cent (<LINK REF="STD-Bodoky-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bodoky 1993</LINK>). As the pathogenesis of post-surgical infection is similar after osteosynthesis of any closed fracture, it has been suggested that combining data from similar prophylactic regimens used during different surgical procedures is quite appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Closed hip fractures in the elderly are common, and surgical management is normal in the developed world. The majority of studies of the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in closed fracture fixation have focused on this group of people. Early randomised trials completed in the 1970s suggested a small but definite prophylactic effect. These trials were individually small, and some used prolonged courses of antibiotic. Many further trials have been reported since then. These have addressed a range of issues: duration of administration, route of administration, and antimicrobial spectrum.</P>
<P>Before the production of the first version of this review (published 1998), a number of descriptive reviews of antibiotic prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery were available (<LINK REF="REF-Doyon--1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyon 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norden 1991</LINK>), in which some attempt had been made to assess methodological quality and include this in the interpretation of results. However, there was sufficient persisting uncertainty about the efficacy, optimal duration, and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis during the surgical treatment of hip and other long bone fractures to justify a systematic review of the evidence from randomised trials. This update continues the systematic review of the evidence.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-02-12 10:29:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review is to determine whether the prophylactic administration of antibiotics in people undergoing surgical management of hip or other closed long bone fractures reduces the incidence of surgical site and other hospital-acquired infections.</P>
<P>The following hypotheses are tested:</P>
<P>1. Antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a reduction in the proportion of people developing a surgical site infection, either deep or superficial, compared with those given a placebo or no prophylaxis.</P>
<P>2. 'Single dose' antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a significant reduction in the proportion of people developing a surgical site infection compared with those given 'longer duration' prophylaxis.</P>
<P>3. Antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a significant reduction in the proportion of people developing septicaemia, respiratory or urinary tract infection, compared with those given a placebo or no prophylaxis.</P>
<P>4. 'Single dose' antibiotic prophylaxis leads to a significant reduction in the proportion of people developing septicaemia, respiratory, or urinary tract infection after surgical management of a hip or other long bone fracture compared with those given three or more doses.</P>
<P>5. Oral administration of a prophylactic regimen leads to a significant reduction in the proportion of people experiencing a surgical site infection, respiratory or urinary tract infection, or adverse drug effect, compared with those receiving parenteral prophylaxis.</P>
<P>6. There is a significant increase in the proportion of people with conditions such as gastro-intestinal symptoms or skin reactions in those allocated antibiotic prophylaxis when compared with those receiving placebo or no prophylaxis.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-10 14:20:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Methodological assessment was undertaken in the original review by the two authors, using the criteria described in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, supplemented by a pre-designed coding manual. Disagreement was resolved by discussion between raters. With further reference to original study reports where necessary, and using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>), risk of bias assessments were completed for all included studies. The risk categories assessed were adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data. As loss to follow up was not an item in the assessment criteria in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, we allocated 'low risk' for incomplete outcome data to studies which reported their losses in each group and an appropriate sensitivity analysis, high risk to those with losses of 5% or more without a sensitivity analysis, and unclear in those with losses less than 5% or which did not report losses.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-02-08 14:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Using Microsoft Excel, we calculated what the effect of missing data might have been on the number of deep infections in each group of each included study.</P>
<P>If the total number of people randomised but not the distribution between participant groups was given, but the number analysed and the losses were available for each group, the number randomised to each group was calculated.</P>
<P>If the total number of losses but not the distribution by groups was known, we explored three assumptions: that the losses were evenly distributed (using nearest integer) between groups; that two thirds of the losses were in the experimental group; and that two thirds of the losses were in the control group.</P>
<P>We assumed that the risk of events amongst lost treatment group participants was that present amongst known control group participants in that study, and that the risk amongst lost control group participants was that present amongst known treatment group participants. In this way, we imputed a reasonable, but conservative estimate of the number of lost participants in each group sustaining a deep infection. </P>

<P>For comparable groups of trials, pooled risk ratios with 95 per cent confidence intervals were derived using the fixed-effect model. Where there was substantial statistical heterogeneity we planned to pool the data, if appropriate, using the random-effects model. Where appropriate, absolute risk reduction was calculated. For the main outcome of interest, deep surgical site infection, the data were presented by subgroups to investigate any possible heterogeneity associated with participant context. In the main analysis, we used for each included study the data on number of participants and number of events in each group provided in the study report, and explored the implications of missing data by imputation and sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>Thirty-one of the completed studies (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) were excluded because either the participants had sustained an open fracture prior to the administration of antibiotics, or participants had not sustained a fracture, or no usable data were reported for participants undergoing internal fixation of closed fractures.

In seven trials the description of the randomisation process implied prior concealment of allocation, thus indicating low risk of bias; in 13 studies it was unclear, and in the three quasi-randomised trials assignment was clearly not concealed.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-08 12:55:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>This review confirms the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the risk of infection, both superficial and deep, after fracture surgery. The 23 trials reported were conducted over a period of 27 years. In the early studies, penicillins effective against gram positive cocci were used. As resistant organisms appeared, subsequent generations of penicillins, and then cephalosporins have been studied in prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment, or against other agents. The evidence for efficacy of prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts, which were secondary outcome measures in many of the included trials, comes from studies which evaluated cephalosporins.</P>
<P>Over time, shorter durations of prophylaxis have been used. For effective prophylaxis, experimental evidence indicates that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic in the tissues must be exceeded for at least the period from incision to wound closure (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1961</LINK>). In practice, this initially meant using regimens with several consecutive doses, and the pooled data support their effectiveness. The availability of agents with a long elimination half life has allowed single dose prophylaxis reliably to meet Burke's prerequisite. Amongst published trials the large multi-centre Netherlands trial (<LINK REF="STD-Boxma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boxma 1996</LINK>), which used an antibiotic which provided concentrations exceeding MIC for 12 to 24 hours, dominates the analysis in this category. This trial supported the hypothesis that single dose intravenous prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of both deep and superficial surgical site infection. The effect sizes are similar to those of from multi-dose prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Direct comparisons of multiple and single dose prophylaxis have also been conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Gatell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gatell 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Buckley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Buckley 1990</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Buckley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Buckley 1990</LINK> was underpowered to distinguish between the two regimens tested. <LINK REF="STD-Gatell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gatell 1987</LINK>, a large single centre study, concluded that single dose prophylaxis was inferior, but the statistical significance in the main analysis was marginal, and no longer present in one of the three plausible sensitivity analyses examining the effect of losses to follow up. Also, the tissue MIC may not have been reliably exceeded throughout the procedure for all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gatell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gatell 1987</LINK>, in which an agent (cefamandole 2 g) with a short half life was administered 30 minutes prior to the planned onset of surgery.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-10 14:38:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Despite the lack of power in many of the individual studies, pooling of the accumulated evidence supports the hypothesis of effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing surgical site infection. <LINK REF="STD-Boxma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boxma 1996</LINK> included an economic evaluation based on the effectiveness data which indicates a cost saving of a little under 500 US dollars per participant given prophylaxis. This may be conservative as the evaluation does not appear to take into account the costs of urinary and respiratory infections prevented.</P>
<P>Albers and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1994</LINK>) have calculated that antibiotic prophylaxis for closed fracture surgery is cost effective if the absolute risk reduction of deep surgical site infection is 0.25% (0.0025) or more; the pooled estimates for absolute risk reduction for single dose or multiple dose prophylaxis in this review exceed that. We should note, however, that the economic analysis was based on a detailed study of 16 participants with infection (eight with deep surgical site infection, eight with superficial surgical site infection) compared with 16 participants without surgical site infection. From this small sample, it is possible that the true costs of uncommon adverse events may have been underestimated. Antibiotics are the major factor driving the emergence of drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2002</LINK>), and the additional costs of antibiotic-resistant infections are substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>). The ecological impact of antibiotic prophylaxis in closed fracture surgery was the focus of one of the ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN75423827" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN75423827</LINK>) identified for this update.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:43:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The trialists' reported definitions of outcome measures varied somewhat. In most reports, the definition of surgical site infection was clinical and did not require microbiological confirmation, although it was often sought. The duration of follow up varied, and it was not always clear whether late follow up was active or opportunistic. So it is possible that some late infections were missed, or that some participants whom we have included as sustaining superficial infections may have presented later with a deep infection.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Boxma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boxma 1996</LINK>) approached contemporary standards of conduct and reporting, and was assessed as being at low risk of bias. Using the approach to assessment across studies suggested in Table 8.7.a in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>, risk of bias was assessed as high or unclear in one or more domain in the other 22 included studies; this leads to an overall assessment that the impact of bias in the individual studies on the results of this review is unclear. We discuss this in the next paragraph.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-08 12:52:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Since the reports of the methods and results of 21 of the 22 included studies in which risk of bias was unclear or high preceded the publication of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement, first published in 1996, and updated in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), we have explored our results through the use of sensitivity analyses as described (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>). We believe that the evidence from our meta-analysis is robust. The sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) showed that the results of all but one comparison were robust when risk of bias in the included studies was taken into account, both overall and with particular assessment of losses to follow up. The marginally significant difference between single and multiple dose prophylaxis, dependent on one study, was no longer evident in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> on sensitivity analysis assuming a 2:1 distribution between multiple dose and single dose losses in <LINK REF="STD-Gatell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gatell 1987</LINK>.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-08 12:53:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>We found three other systematic reviews relevant to antibiotic prophylaxis for closed fracture management. <LINK REF="REF-Southwell_x002d_Keely-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southwell-Keely 2004</LINK> focused on hip fracture surgery and included 15 studies. Their findings were consistent with those of this review. <LINK REF="REF-Slobogean-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slobogean 2008</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of single versus multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical treatment of closed fractures and other clean orthopaedic surgery. Using slightly different inclusion criteria to those of this review, they included seven trials with 3,808 participants and found no evidence that single dose prophylaxis was inferior to a multiple dose regimen (RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.60). Their finding was also consistent with this review.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review and economic analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Cranny-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranny 2008</LINK>) has addressed the issue of whether the choice of agent for routine antibiotic prophylaxis for surgery should take account of multiple antibiotic resistance amongst gram positive organisms by a switch from non-glycopeptide to glycopeptide prophylaxis. <LINK REF="REF-Cranny-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranny 2008</LINK> concluded that there is at present "insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a threshold prevalence of MRSA at which switching from non-glycopeptide to glycopeptide antibiotic prophylaxis might be clinically effective and cost-effective".</P>

<P>1. Antibiotic prophylaxis for closed fracture surgery is an effective intervention for reducing the incidence of deep and superficial surgical site infection. Application of cost-modelling has indicated that it also appears to be cost-effective, although this model took no account of the impact of prophylaxis on the development of antibiotic resistance.<BR/>2. Single dose intravenous prophylaxis does not appear inferior to multiple dose regimens, particularly if the agent used provides tissue levels exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration over a 12 hour period.</P>

<P>In the protocol, it was proposed to test the hypothesis that there is a significant reduction in the proportion of participants with a post-operative surgical site infection who receive prophylaxis using broad-spectrum antibiotics when compared with those who receive narrow-spectrum agents. We realised early in the process of the review that this was an inappropriate hypothesis. Since the great majority of surgical site infections are caused by gram-positive cocci, whose sensitivity to individual agents has changed over time, the important issue is the sensitivity of these organisms to the agent used rather than the breadth of its spectrum.</P>
<P>In this update, we have adopted a number of new methods introduced by The Cochrane Collaboration along with Review Manager 5. In the assessment of risk of bias, we have reviewed the data and judgements on methodological assessment from previous versions, in order to align our findings with current best practice in the assessment of risk of bias in the conduct of clinical trials. In so doing, we have created risk of bias assessments for each included study, and graphical summaries of these findings.</P>
<P>We have also conducted sensitivity analyses of the effect of missing data on our previous analyses of deep post-surgical infection, the principle outcome of interest when evaluating antibiotic prophylaxis. Details can be found under <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK> in the text of the review. </P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2010-02-10 14:40:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>I very much enjoyed reading the new Cochrane review of antibiotic usage in fracture prosthetic surgery. This is full of fascinating information, and is a good marriage of high-quality statistical and clinical input. I have made our Orthopaedic surgeons aware of the review's findings, and have proposed a change to our agreed prophylactic protocols as a result.</P>
<P>The review usefully examined the effects of long- and short-half life agents, but another common point of debate is the choice of narrow-spectrum (mainly isoxazolyl penicillin) versus broad-spectrum (e.g. cefuroxime, or isoxazolyl penicillin plus gentamicin) prophylaxis. There is a suggestion in the classic Lidwell/MRC study reports that broad spectrum prophylaxis may reduce infection rates (by reducing deep Gram-negative infections), but others have been concerned about costs, side effects (principally Clost. difficile diarrhoea) and induction of resistance associated with broader-spectrum agents. Did the group consider this approach? Could it be examined in the future?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2010-01-11 11:55:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Many thanks for your interest in our review. We did not identify any trial which compared narrow and broad spectrum agents in the closed fracture population. There are in joint replacement (<LINK REF="STD-Pollard-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pollard 1979;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Vainionpaa-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vainionpaa 1988</LINK>), and in open fracture management (<LINK REF="STD-Patzakis-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Patzakis 1977</LINK>); these studies were in our excluded trials table. If we have missed any that you know about, I would be most interested to hear of them. In <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1983</LINK> (a study which we included comparing antibiotic versus placebo), the choice of antibiotic was at the discretion of the treating surgeon, but the trial did not compare these options. There seems to be evidence of a beneficial effect in limiting urinary tract infection when a cephalosporin was compared with a placebo (see the analyses in our review).</P>
