<TITLE>Same day surgery compared to overnight stay for treatment of cataract caused by old age</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-16 12:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Is day care surgery as effective, safe and feasible for treatment of cataract as in-patient surgery?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>The lens in the eyes can become cloudy with age (called cataracts), leading to blurry vision or total vision loss. Cataracts can be surgically removed by breaking up the lens and removing the pieces with a needle (a process called phacoemulsification), followed by the placing of an artificial lens to restore vision. This method of surgery is quick and together with a shorter recovery period has made the possibility of day surgery a reality. We wanted to find out whether operation in a day care unit was as effective and safe as staying overnight after an operation to replace the lens and regain better vision. Furthermore, we were interested to know what the side effects, risks and complications were of the two different approaches. We took into account improvement in quality of life and differences in costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The review included two trials (up to August 2015) conducted in Spain and the USA, involving 1284 people with cataract. A total of 68 people were treated as day care surgery, while 598 stayed overnight in the hospital. The mean age of the participants was about 70 years and there were slightly more women than men. The studies were not funded by a drug company.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>The two studies in this review found that in developed countries at least, there was some evidence that day surgery for this type of cataract extraction may not only be cheaper but just as effective as hospitalisation and overnight stay for cataract extraction. Although the evidence on complications after surgery such as swelling of the cornea, leaking of the wound and temporary increased pressure within the eye was inconclusive, there appeared to be little differences in visual acuity and improvements in quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>One of the two studies showed limitations in study design and the way it was run, probably as it was an old study and reported in a less robust way. It provided fewer data for the review. The people included in the studies were representative for the group we were interested in.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2015), the ISRCTN registry (<A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch">www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>).

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-05 13:34:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing day care and in-patient surgery for age-related cataract. The primary outcome was the achievement of a satisfactory visual acuity six weeks after the operation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-01 10:25:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 12:38:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included two trials. One study was conducted in the USA in 1981 (250 people randomised and completed trial) and one study conducted in Spain in 2001 (1034 randomised, 935 completed trial). Both trials used extracapsular cataract extraction techniques that are not commonly used in higher income countries now. Most of the data in this review came from the larger trial, which we judged to be at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The mean change in visual acuity (in Snellen lines) of the operated eye four months postoperatively was similar in people given day care surgery (mean 4.1 lines standard deviation (SD) 2.3, 464 participants) compared to people treated as in-patients (mean 4.1 lines, SD 2.2, 471 participants) (P value = 0.74). No data were available from either study on intra-operative complications.</P>
<P>Wound leakage, intraocular pressure (IOP) and corneal oedema were reported in the first day postoperatively and at four months after surgery. There was an increased risk of high IOP in the day care group in the first day after surgery (risk ratio (RR) 3.33, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.21 to 9.16, 935 participants) but not at four months (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.55, 935 participants). The findings for the other outcomes were inconclusive with wide CIs. There were two cases of endophthalmitis observed at four months in the day care group and none in the in-patient group. The smaller study stated that there were no infections or severe hyphaemas.</P>
<P>In a subset of participants evaluated for quality of life (VF14 questionnaire) similar change in quality of life before and four months after surgery was observed (mean change in VF14 score: day care group 25.2, SD 21.2, 150 participants; in-patient group: 23.5, SD 25.7, 155 participants; P value = 0.30). Subjective assessment of patient satisfaction in the smaller study suggested that participants preferred to recuperate at home, were more comfortable in their familiar surroundings and enjoyed the family support that they received at home. Costs were 20% more for the in-patient group and this was attributed to higher costs for overnight stay.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 12:38:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This review provides evidence that there is cost saving with day care cataract surgery compared to in-patient cataract surgery. Although effects on visual acuity and quality of life appeared similar, the evidence with respect to postoperative complications was inconclusive because the effect estimates were imprecise. Given the wide-spread adoption of day care cataract surgery, future research in cataract clinical pathways should focus on evidence provided by high quality clinical databases (registers), which would enable clinicians and healthcare planners to agree clinical and social indications for in-patient care and so make better use of resources.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-22 08:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Age-related cataract accounts for more than 40% of cases of blindness throughout the world with the majority of people blind from cataract found in the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>). In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) launched a joint initiative known as "VISION 2020: The Right to Sight," which aims to eliminate avoidable blindness by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). With the development of prevention of blindness programmes in many countries, an increasing number of people with cataracts are gaining access to surgical treatment for their ailment (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 1994</LINK>). Nevertheless, the number of people blind as a result of cataract is increasing due to changes in the demographic structure of populations, the most important of which is increased life expectancy (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minassian-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minassian 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1998</LINK>). One study, Rapid Assessments of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 1997</LINK>), in Eritrea demonstrated an adjusted prevalence of bilateral blindness with available correction for people aged 50 years and older was 7.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2% to 8.8%) (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of blindness in Eritrea is high if compared with reported blindness rates of about 2.0% for other African countries, China and most Latin American countries (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xiao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiao 2010</LINK>). Surgery is the only effective treatment for cataract and, therefore, it is important to review the safety, effectiveness and ultimately the cost effectiveness of various modes of surgery.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-22 08:16:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>A cataract is opacity of the cortex or capsule of the lens (or both) and each type of cataract can have different characteristics. People can present with one or more of the following symptoms: gradual diminution of visual acuity, glare, decreased contrast sensitivity, frequent change in glasses prescription and change in colour appreciation (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 2008</LINK>). The condition is usually found by a primary care physician or optometrist, followed by referral to an ophthalmic surgeon for confirmation of the diagnosis and management. Access to eye tests varies by socioeconomic deprivation in England (<LINK REF="REF-Shickle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shickle 2015</LINK>) and distance from optician (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 2009</LINK>). Many people with treatable visual impairment from cataract do not access health services, mainly due to socioeconomic considerations (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-01 10:41:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Surgical removal of the cataract is currently the only treatment option once the lens has opacified. This is usually accompanied by implantation of an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) to replace the natural lens.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-01 10:14:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Present day cataract surgery and IOL implantation allow accurate prediction of postoperative visual acuity. Several refinements have been made in surgical techniques in order to offer better postoperative clinical outcomes. The most notable revolution in cataract surgery in the last two decades was the change from the large 10-mm incision extracapsular cataract extraction procedure to the small 3- to 4-mm incision operation, which is known as phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification involves fragmenting the lens inside the eye prior to its aspiration via a wide bore needle. This change is generally perceived to offer greater predictability of refractive outcomes, a shorter convalescence and faster recovery of full visual function. A Cochrane systematic review comparing different surgical approaches for treatment of age-related cataract was published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-22 08:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>With the advent of phacoemulsification in the early 1990s and the increasing use of local anaesthesia in cataract extraction, there has been a gradual trend towards management of people with cataracts as day cases. Such a trend was initially driven by the necessity of cost containment, the need to shorten waiting list times and to increase the capacity of health care providers in performing more surgeries per unit of time significantly. With increasing demand, 'stand alone' day care centres have opened both in the public and private sectors. These centres are able to offer diagnostic and treatment facilities for people with cataracts including day case cataract extraction operations that are usually performed under local anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Cresswell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cresswell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mojon_x002d_Azzi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mojon-Azzi 2007</LINK>). A more recent modification to the method of delivery of cataract surgery under local anaesthesia that is being used increasingly for highly selected cases is 'Cataract Surgery by Appointment'. The direct arrival of the person at the operating theatre, having self prepared for surgery, avoids admission to the ward or time spent in the day case unit and can result in a stay of as little as 20 minutes from arrival to discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Mavrikakis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavrikakis 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initial concerns about the quality of service provided by day care units and purpose-built centres delayed the wider spread of day care surgery. Most notable were concerns about whether this treatment modality has the same clinical outcome as the classic in-patient procedure and whether it carries a higher risk of intraoperative or postoperative complications (or both). An equally important aspect was the person's perspective of such an experience; that is would people prefer to undergo surgery done in such day care units or alternatively with full in-patient admission? However, one study by Tey et al., which examined different ways of streamlining cataract surgery services, found that a multifaceted approach that included increased utilisation of cataract nursing staff based in one-stop cataract clinics resulted in an increased number of day care surgery cases without any compromise in quality (<LINK REF="REF-Tey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tey 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several non-controlled studies have compared the clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of cataract extraction performed in day care units with those done as in-patients, (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cillino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cillino 2007</LINK>). This review provides an objective evaluation and comparison between two different concepts in healthcare planning and management. In addition, it serves as a stimulus for examining major changes in treatment modalities driven and supported by evidence-based patient choice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of trial details</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Castells-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 2001</LINK> study was an unmasked randomised clinical trial of people undergoing cataract surgery in three public hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) in which 1034 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: out-patient hospital and in-patient hospital. People were eligible if they were scheduled for cataract surgery that did not include any other ophthalmological procedure and if they met certain inclusion criteria for ambulatory surgery. A total of 464 out-patients and 471 in-patients completed the trial. For the majority of participants, the planned procedure was extracapsular cataract extraction with IOL implantation. Of these participants, 17.5% out-patients and 16.6% in-patients underwent phacoemulsification.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes were postoperative complications within 24 hours of surgery, postoperative complications between 24 hours and four months after surgery, visual acuity of the operated and the better eye four months after surgery, and change in visual acuity pre- and postoperatively. Secondary outcomes focused on the evaluation of self reported outcomes that were administered by trained interviewers by telephone in the preoperative and four-month postoperative period. Visual function was assessed using the VF14 Index. The Cataract Symptom Score was used to measure the degree of difficulty caused by five symptoms common to people with cataracts. Additionally, the trial used the Sickness Impact Profile to assess participant's perceived health status and sickness-related dysfunction. Economic data relating to direct costs associated with the surgery, in-patient stay and four-month follow-up were estimated and calculated per participant.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Galin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Galin 1981</LINK> study, 273 people who needed cataract surgery were asked to participate and 250 were randomised into three age-matched groups. Cataract extraction was performed either with or without a Sputnik IOL. After completion of surgery, participants stayed in a hospital or a hotel or went home. Details regarding postoperative outcomes were very sparse. The study provided some detail on the cost of hotel stay but there was no information available on direct costs incurred as a result of the surgical procedure.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 15:01:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The lack of high quality trials to synthesise was disappointing as the significance of this review in supporting a shift in methodology from in-patient to day care surgery can at present only be assessed by subjective means. However, it is readily apparent that this shift has already taken place, seemingly validated by experientially based opinion. The data that we reviewed produced no surprises and appears to provide confirmatory evidence of the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of day care cataract surgery. By way of further confirmation of the results, the <LINK REF="STD-Castells-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 2001</LINK> study showed similar mean changes in visual acuity between the two groups, which compared favourably with those found in the US National Study of Surgery Outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1994</LINK>). It was apparent from this study that the effectiveness of cataract surgery performed as a day case procedure, assessed by visual acuity, equals that of the corresponding in-patient procedure and thereby provides clinicians with a certain degree of confidence in the selection of a day care approach.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-22 08:27:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Although there were statistically significant differences in immediate postoperative complications between the two groups, these did not appear to have a marked effect on the overall postoperative complications, which should further minimise any unease with day care cataract surgery. The more subjective quality of life measures and visual function results provided further corroborative evidence of the effectiveness of day care surgery as a preferred modality. Additionally, in this era of soaring healthcare costs and cost containment there is a perception that day care surgery should provide a more cost-effective approach in the treatment of cataract surgery, a premise that the two included studies appear to confirm. However, care should be taken in examining the balance sheet as there are hidden community costs that need to be included in the day care surgery equation, costs that may in the end support the change solely as a cost-shifting economic exercise.</P>
<P>The electronic searches identified one systematic review published in Spanish, which included the trials that we assessed in our review (<LINK REF="REF-Castells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castells 2000</LINK>). We arranged to have the review translated into English. In the translated copy, the authors indicated that the quality assessment of their included studies followed the guidelines of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group and the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) Statement, which they further added; evaluate primary criteria (randomisation of assigned treatment, attrition and intention-to-treat analyses) and secondary criteria (masking). We reviewed all the included studies and found ourselves unable to concur with all of the quality assessments made by the authors of some of these studies and additionally noted that this Spanish systematic review was not referenced in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.<BR/>

<P>This review based on two trials conducted in the developed world provides some evidence that there is a cost saving but no significant difference in outcome or risk of postoperative complications between day care and in-patient cataract surgery. Evidence regarding people's preferences for day case cataract surgery versus in-patient admission was inconclusive.</P>

Therefore, the resolution of some of the questions about the safety and cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery in day care centres should be elucidated using data from high quality clinical databases or registries, such as the Cataract Surgery Registry set up in Malaysia (<LINK REF="REF-Cataract-Surgery-Registry-Malaysia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cataract Surgery Registry Malaysia 2002</LINK>). This should enable clinicians and healthcare planners to agree clinical and social indications for in-patient care and so make better use of resources, by selecting day case surgery unless these criteria are met.</P>
<P>In the developed world, the resolution of some of the questions about the safety and cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery in day care centres should enable healthcare planners to make better use of resources, by selecting day case surgery unless there are agreed clinical and social indications for in-patient care. This could result in the freeing up of hospital beds and staff that would normally be required for in-patient cataract surgery. Although the review specifically considered economic data related to cost-effectiveness, some reference should be made to the possibility of any total cost saving in the change from day care to in-patient cataract surgery. There is some unease with the cost-saving premise in that the move to day case cataract surgery may be seen solely as a cost-shifting exercise, shifting the cost burden on to the community while removing it from the health service with possibly no total cost saving.</P>
<P>In the developing world with its funding and resource difficulties, consideration of the results of this review may encourage health policy planners to evaluate a possible wider adoption of 'cataract camps'. Although these programmes have been available since the early 1990s, there have been reservations expressed about the quality of care and possible postoperative complications. There are tangible benefits with improved access to care for medically under-served regions if fully equipped mobile units can visit out-reach clinics and provide quality day care cataract surgery equivalent to that of in-patient care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-30 15:21:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The sparse number of RCTs on this topic indicate that the progression from in-patient to day care as the primary treatment modality has already taken place in a shift driven by necessity, cost and a simplification of the procedure.</P>
<P>In the developed world, there does not appear to be any further debate about the safety and outcomes of day care cataract surgery, but there is controversy on appropriate thresholds for cataract surgery and the validity of participant-reported outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future research on these topics is required and should also explore issues of severity thresholds for when in-patient cataract surgery is appropriate. In the absence of additional RCTs, essential evidence could be provided by researchers working with clinicians to develop and use the high quality clinical databases noted above.</P>
<P>Future research in the developing world could well continue to focus on safety, outcomes, type of surgical procedure, as well as costs, all of which may help confirm the universal applicability of the findings from the developed world. It is important that additional trials pay greater attention to detail in their design and reporting and consider using the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) Statement to ensure that important factors such as random allocation sequence, masked assessment and dealing with withdrawals are included.</P>
<P>Finally, we note that the design of the <LINK REF="STD-Castells-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 2001</LINK> study provides a sound template for measuring the benefits of surgery. It includes the use of participant assessed visual function via visual quality of life measures and moves away from a sole reliance on visual acuity with its widely acknowledged ability to capture only a limited aspect of visual function. More research on the validity and reliability of these participant-reported outcome measures is required so that consideration should also be given to a greater role for these participant-reported visual function and visual quality of life outcome instruments and specifically in the measurement of need for, and benefits from, surgery.</P>
