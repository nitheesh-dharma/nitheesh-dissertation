Most seizures are well controlled with medicines and other types of treatments, but epilepsy can cause problems in social, school and work situations, making independent living difficult. People with seizures tend to have physical problems (e.g. fractures, bruising and a slightly increased risk of sudden death) as well as social problems because of the stigma attached to the illness. People with epilepsy and their families may lack social support or experience social isolation, embarrassment, fear and discrimination, and some parents may also feel guilty. Self-management of epilepsy refers to a wide range of health behaviours and activities that a person can learn and adapt to control their seizures and improve their well-being. This approach needs a partnership between the person and the providers of services (e.g. specialist epilepsy outpatient clinics, nurse-based liaison services between family doctors and specialist hospital doctors, specialist epilepsy community teams), as well as targeted services for specific groups (e.g. children, teenagers and families).</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched scientific databases for studies in children and adolescents with epilepsy that looked at the effects of self-management of epilepsy. The results are current to September 2016.

Four interventions were aimed at children and their parents; one was aimed at teenagers and their parents; and one was aimed at children, adolescents and their parents. Each of the interventions appeared to improve some of the outcomes studied, but no intervention improved all of the outcomes that were measured. The studies also had problems with their methods, which makes their results less reliable. While none of the interventions caused any harm, their impact was limited, and we cannot recommend any single intervention as being the best one for children with epilepsy.</P><P>Evidence for the best ways to care for children with epilepsy is still unclear.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The quality of the evidence is poor because all of the studies had major problems in how they were run.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-01 11:32:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-10 10:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In response to criticism that epilepsy care for children has little impact, healthcare professionals and administrators have developed various service models and strategies to address perceived inadequacies.<BR/></P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-10 10:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effects of any specialised or dedicated intervention for epilepsy versus usual care in children with epilepsy and in their families.<BR/></P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-10 10:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (27 September 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 9) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to 27 September 2016), Embase (1974 to 27 September 2016), PsycINFO (1887 to 27 September 2016) and CINAHL Plus (1937 to 27 September 2016).

Researchers have identified at least 40 different seizure types (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>). While most people can control seizures with medications and other treatment options, epilepsy can pose challenges in social, school and work situations and for independent living. Not only do people with seizures tend to have more physical problems (such as fractures, bruising and a slightly increased risk of sudden death), they also face significant challenges because of how the condition is perceived (or indeed misperceived), which can lead to people with epilepsy being stigmatised (<LINK REF="REF-Bandstra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandstra 2008</LINK>). As a result, both people with epilepsy and their families may lack social support and experience social isolation, embarrassment, fear and discrimination, while some parents also report feelings of parental guilt (<LINK REF="REF-England-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2012</LINK>). Epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide, with around 80% of all cases in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Epilepsy is most common in children and older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1990</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-10 10:38:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The self-management of epilepsy refers to a wide range of health behaviours and activities that a person can learn and adapt in order to promote seizure control and enhance well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1997</LINK>). Self-management of any condition typically entails a partnership between users and service providers (<LINK REF="REF-Clark--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>). Various dedicated models of service provision exist to improve care networks and self-education (<LINK REF="REF-Clark--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>). Services may include specialist epilepsy outpatient clinics, nurse-based liaison services between primary (general practitioner; GP) and secondary/tertiary (hospital-based) care, and specialist epilepsy multidisciplinary community teams (<LINK REF="REF-Clark--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>).

Importantly, it should enable people with epilepsy (and their families) to cope with all aspects of the disease through improved self-education and self-management (<LINK REF="REF-Clark--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-01 11:48:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Different authors have criticised epilepsy care for its limited impact on the range of health and social needs of people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chappell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thapar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thapar 1996</LINK>).

Despite identifying two additional controlled before-and-after study reports in the 2015 update (<LINK REF="STD-Jantzen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jantzen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pf_x00e4_fflin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pfäfflin 2012</LINK>), plus an additional RCT in the most recent update (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2016</LINK>), the overall findings remain unchanged. This is unsurprising given that one of the additional publications reported on an intervention (FLIP&amp;FLAP) previously evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Pf_x00e4_fflin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pfäfflin 2012</LINK>), published in German (Rau 2006), and included in our previous review. We are not aware of any other reviews that have considered care delivery and self-management strategies specifically for children or adolescents. However, three similar reviews have examined psychosocial treatment programmes in epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK>), evidence-based models of care for people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>), and care delivery and self-management strategies for adults with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2016</LINK>). The review of care delivery and self-management strategies for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2016</LINK>), which is currently being updated alongside this update for children, reported that two intervention types, specialist epilepsy nurse and self-management education, had some evidence of benefit. However, there was no clear evidence that other service models substantially improved outcomes for adults with epilepsy. The two other reviews reported similar findings (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK> suggested that the psychoeducational model, in particular the SEE programme (<LINK REF="REF-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgeson 1990</LINK>), may be the most promising in terms of delivering knowledge and psychosocial treatment outcomes, as well as being potentially the most cost-effective. We note, though, that the review author of <LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK> also developed the SEE programme in the 1980s and is one of the co-authors of <LINK REF="REF-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgeson 1990</LINK>. However, in a conflict of interest statement at the end of his review he stated that he "had no role in SEE program outcome research cited herein aside from presenting the program for independent researchers." All reviews have noted that there is currently a lack of evidence for the cost-effectiveness of any intervention.</P><P>A limitation of the current review is that all studies have methodological flaws, no intervention has been evaluated with different study samples and no interventions were sufficiently homogeneous enough to be included in a meta-analysis, so it is difficult to generalise the results and advise on practice. In addition, the descriptions of some interventions lack sufficient detail to allow their reproduction. In this respect, it might have been helpful to have included a process evaluation, so that the results were more generalisable.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-01 12:44:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-01 12:43:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The evidence from this review suggests that innovative models of service delivery may improve some outcomes relating to epilepsy in children and their parents. However, no single strategy improved a comprehensive range of user outcomes, and methodological deficiencies within each study mean that the results must be treated with caution.</P><P>Programme evaluations have not been replicated using different study samples, and in most cases the same team of researchers undertook the design, delivery and evaluation of each programme. At present there is insufficient evidence in favour of any single programme and so, while no programme showed negative impacts on children with epilepsy or their parents, it is not possible to recommend any single programme as being more effective than any other. No programme showed consistent improvement across all of the assessed outcomes. Healthcare professionals and families need to be aware of this when considering any of these strategies for implementation.<BR/></P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-01 12:44:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We identified six distinct self-management programmes for educating or counselling children with epilepsy and their parents. However, no intervention has been evaluated with different study samples and the studies show methodological flaws, were not independently assessed and had inconsistent results. The evidence from this review suggests that innovative models of service delivery may improve some outcomes relating to epilepsy in children and to the impact that epilepsy can have on parents. However, no single strategy improved a comprehensive range of user outcomes, and methodological deficiencies within each study mean that readers should interpret the results with caution.</P><P>As a result, further studies are needed that:</P><UL><LI>offer an improved quality of study design and reporting;</LI><LI>improve generalisability (e.g. include a full description of the intervention, a process evaluation, and a multicentred assessment of the benefits for more than one population and service provider);</LI><LI>evaluate the effects of interventions for those subgroups most likely to benefit (e.g. children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, children with learning disabilities);</LI><LI>consider objective outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of service models shown to be beneficial.</LI></UL><P>To maximise the potential of future studies for generalisability and to ensure study quality, we would recommend randomised controlled trials rather than observational studies. Studies should also ensure that the interventions are adequately defined and described and that investigators take into account contextual factors in the study design. Where socially complex interventions such as these are under study, enough service providers must be included to ensure that individual characteristics do not bias the results.<BR/></P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-28 14:21:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We would like to thank Laura Burfoot, who helped us to summarise the results from the studies in the original review.

Group activities of the model include games, drawings, stories, videos, and roleplay.</P><P>The model is based on the idea of children's autonomy in which children are trained to assume a leading role in the management of their own health. The programme aims to provide children with self-management skills and help them to achieve self-reliance and to use appropriate preventive strategies, thereby improving their social functioning and quality of life. ACINDES also aims to enable parents to learn to recognise and accept their children's autonomy and become 'facilitators' rather than 'managers' in their child&#8217;s self-management of their condition.</P><P>Teachers coordinate group activities which are supervised by programme physicians. These teachers are required to be trained in promoting children's self-regulation or autonomy as well as certain specific aspects of chronic conditions (asthma, epilepsy) and their clinical management. Groups of children are arranged according to age (6-8 years, 9-12 years, 13-15 years) with no more than 10 children per teacher. Parent groups are co-ordinated by one or two teachers but are not arranged according to the ages of the children. The child's physician participates in ACINDES by being invited to sessions, at which he or she meets separately with children and parents and answers their questions.</P><P>The programme consists of five weekly two-hour meetings, followed by a reinforcement meeting two to six months later. The aims of the sessions are to enable children and parents to:</P><UL><LI>learn about the child's condition (asthma, epilepsy) and identify body signals and early warning signs;</LI><LI>recognise the elements of equilibrium (maintaining balance, avoiding imbalance) and identify their own triggers;</LI><LI>understand treatment, therapeutic alternatives and the usefulness of a direct patient-physician relationship;</LI><LI>handle specific risk situations (identify risks and learn strategies to handle them, including emergency home treatments;</LI><LI>develop appropriate decision-making strategies based on the child's own expected values.</LI></UL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Children's Epilepsy Programme (CEP)</HEADING><P>The CEP was initially developed and piloted with 40 children with epilepsy (aged 7-12 years) at the Medical Center of the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1991</LINK>). It consists of 4 sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours and delivered at weekly intervals. Children and parents are taught separately, meeting to share experiences at the end of each session.</P><P>Each session has a specific theme.</P><UL><LI>Session 1, understanding body messages: this uses electronic toys and cartoon drawings to teach children about seizures and to help them identify seizure-related emotions and feelings.</LI><LI>Session 2, controlling seizures with medication: this focuses on seizure-related information, using a card-sorting exercise to separate facts and fictions about seizures. It also teaches seizure management and decision-making skills.</LI><LI>Session 3, telling others in a matter-of-fact way: children are encouraged to share personal experiences, especially experiences with friends or peers, whether related to epilepsy or not. Children learn how to tell others about their epilepsy.</LI><LI>Session 4, coping and adapting to balance my life: various exercises are used to develop coping skills, including ways of dealing with bullying or taunting or with negative attitudes.</LI></UL><P>The parental group of the CEP follows the same basic structure as the child-focused group but is based on a Rogerian model of counselling and enables parents to review the children's sessions as described above. The parental sessions for the intervention group are as follows (the paper does not report on who delivers these sessions).</P><UL><LI>Session 1, telling a story: parents introduce themselves to other group members and share their experiences of their child with epilepsy. A card-sorting exercise to dispel false perceptions or myths is undertaken.</LI><LI>Session 2, making decisions: a decision-making process is used to develop decision-making skills.</LI><LI>Session 3, working as a family system: the group develops their understanding of how a child's epilepsy can impact on family life and discuss their parenting styles;.</LI><LI>Session 4, coping and adapting: in this final session parents discuss how to be more open about their child's epilepsy and how to acknowledge the pain and grief that may arise when parenting a child with a chronic condition.</LI></UL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">FAMOSES</HEADING><P>While the content of the sessions for parents and children is similar, focusing on topics such as basic knowledge, diagnosis, treatment and living with epilepsy, each group is taught separately (<LINK REF="STD-Pf_x00e4_fflin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pfäfflin 2012</LINK>; Rau 2006). FAMOSES was developed by a multidisciplinary group of neuropaediatricians, psychologists, social workers and educators. It was designed to be used in different settings (e.g. epilepsy centres, outpatient clinics, inpatient settings and in weekly or weekend courses). The number of participants is restricted to 6 in the children's programme and 12 in the parent's programme, with two trainers working with each group. Trainers are physicians, psychologists, social workers, therapeutic educators or electroencephalogram assistants. The co-operation of a physician and a psychologist as co-trainers in the parents' programme is reported to be very useful in covering the medical and emotional aspects (<LINK REF="REF-FAMOSES-Project-Group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAMOSES Project Group 2007</LINK>). The programme was first implemented in Germany and Switzerland in the spring of 2005 and is now reported to be operating in different epilepsy centres in German-speaking countries. Using educational material such as age-related illustrations interrupted by games, the children's content is presented as a virtual journey by sea, in which a virtual crew of 'sailors' are accompanied by educated trainers. The virtual journey consists of 7 modules (60-90 minutes each).</P><UL><LI>Harbour: group members become acquainted with each other and are motivated to discuss actively their experiences of epilepsy with each other.</LI><LI>Rock Island: alongside information about the frequency of epilepsy, the influence of the disease on everyday activities and how to react in case of a seizure, children are encouraged to talk about emotions connected with epilepsy and how to deal with them.</LI><LI>Volcano Island: the pathophysiological background of epilepsy is explained (i.e. causes, types of seizures and what happens in the brain during a seizure).</LI><LI>Treasure Island: information about important diagnostic tests presented alongside an exploration of children's own experience and feelings with their seizures. Emphasis is placed on the importance of accurate observation and description of seizures.</LI><LI>Fungus Rock: major aspects of therapy are explored including the aims of medical treatment, the need for active co-operation and therapeutic options if drugs do not work. Focus is given to individual therapeutic aims and children's own impact on managing the seizures and their consequences.</LI><LI>Holiday Island: children are taught how to talk about epilepsy and how to react properly in the case of an observed seizure.</LI><LI>Lighthouse Island: the content of the whole course is summarised and in a short ceremony, 'sailors' are promoted to 'captains' of their own ships. This is considered to be one step in managing their own lives with epilepsy.</LI></UL><P>The adult's content consists of 6 modules (60 to 90 minutes each).</P><UL><LI>Module 1, overview: group members become acquainted with each other and are motivated to reflect actively on their own ideas and emotions about epilepsy.</LI><LI>Module 2, basic knowledge: information is given about the causes or pathophysiology of epilepsy, as well as about different seizure types.</LI><LI>Module 3, diagnostic: the role of diagnostic tests in the diagnosis and therapy of epilepsy are explained. The importance of seizure observation, description and documentation, and the need to support children in sensing and describing their own seizures is emphasised.</LI><LI>Module 4, therapy: major aspects of epilepsy therapy are discussed. Medical treatment is the focal point but additional non-medical treatment options are also discussed. Materials to be explored at home are provided.</LI><LI>Module 5, prognosis: the prognosis of different epilepsies with respect to seizure remission and discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs is explored alongside the motor and cognitive development of the child with epilepsy.</LI><LI>Module 6, living with epilepsy: recognition of, and strategies for, coping with epilepsy-related emotional aspects of relationships with parents and siblings are explored. Group members have the opportunity to share their experiences, taking other participants as models to learn from and to be motivated by. Different disease management strategies are discussed, and hints are given on where to get help in critical situations (legal, financial, self-help, written and audio-visual information).</LI></UL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Supporting Treatment Adherence Regimen (STAR)</HEADING><P>This family-tailored antiepileptic drug adherence intervention was developed by two paediatric psychologists specialising in epilepsy (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2016</LINK>). It consisted of four educational and problem-solving sessions over two months. In particular, the first session of the intervention focused on addressing deficits in epilepsy knowledge and providing education about the importance of antiepileptic drug adherence. This included:</P><UL><LI>education of epilepsy treatment and antiepileptic drug adherence;</LI><LI>review of patient&#8217;s prescribed treatment regimen;</LI><LI>review of Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire.</LI></UL><P>The goals of the problem-solving approach were introduced during the second session and were as follows.</P><UL><LI>Problem definition: family identified an important adherence barrier.</LI><LI>Generating alternative solutions: family taught to generate several creative solutions.</LI><LI>Family decision-making: family writes down solutions and systematically evaluate.</LI><LI>Implementation of new solution: family selects one solution to implement (action plan).</LI><LI>Evaluation and renegotiation: a detailed solution was written out with specifics regarding when, where, and how the new solution will be attempted, and a behavioural contract was signed by all participants of the problem-solving session; telephone follow-ups were conducted one week after the problem-solving session to assist the family in either fine-tuning the solution or renegotiating a new solution.</LI></UL><P>A review of the participant&#8217;s prescribed treatment regimen with feedback on antiepileptic drug adherence over the past 2 weeks was provided at all the sessions. As described in <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2013</LINK>, during sessions 2-4, families identified a specific antiepileptic drug adherence barrier and then a problem- solving exercise was conducted. Families generated potential solutions to overcome the barrier. Each family member participating in the session was required to rate each solution and a final solution was agreed on by the family. The written action plan provided a detailed solution with specifics regarding when, where, and how the new solution should be implemented. A behavioral contract outlining the action plan was signed by all participants of the problem-solving session. Between intervention sessions, the family was instructed to use the plan, and the interventionist contacted the family in between via telephone or email to provide continued guidance and support as the family implemented the action plan. This provided families the opportunity to fine-tune the solution or renegotiate a new solution if the solution identified in sessions 2-3 was not working well. A similar problem solving format was used for sessions 3-4, with a follow-up phone contact in between visits.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Modi-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2016</LINK> notes that even young children were able participate in problem-solving sessions, although the extent of the engagement did vary depending on age. For example, the authors note, toddlers and preschool children could provide examples of rewards/reinforcers they liked and whether they liked possible solutions. In contrast, older children were more likely to provide viable solutions that families could choose and would often be involved in helping write these down and choose the solution.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Strategies for teenagers and parents</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Counselling programme based on video-conferencing for teenagers and their families</HEADING><P>During an initial assessment, a 90-minute video-taped family interview involved a series of open-ended questions about the nature of each family member's concerns (<LINK REF="STD-Glueckauf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Glueckauf 2002</LINK>). Five family counselling sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours then follow. Commencing around two weeks later, the primary function of the second session is to identify the priorities for counselling and to develop an initial treatment plan, focusing on two or three priorities for intervention. The following sessions are also typically at intervals of two weeks. The primary objectives of these sessions are to assist family members in attaining their specific counselling goals. Each session follows a similar format centred on the counselling goals. At the end of the fifth session, family members are asked to consider the option of pursuing further intervention (two additional sessions) or terminating the programme after the sixth session.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Strategies for children, adolescents and their parents</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">FLIP&amp;FLAP programme</HEADING><P>The FLIP&amp;FLAP programme was developed following a three-stage process (<LINK REF="STD-Jantzen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jantzen 2009</LINK>). This process included in the first phase, qualitative interviews conducted with 7 children with epilepsy (aged 8 to 18 years) and their mothers and information about the most frequent questions and worries of parents and children being reported to the project team from epilepsy specialists. In the second phase, a training guideline was produced and piloted on a children's course, an adolescent's course and two adults' courses. From these pilot sessions, in the third phase, the curriculum of the programme was systematically developed using a formative evaluation of 37 children/adolescents and 54 parents conducted in several north German clinics; the results of each evaluation were used to tailor the programme more closely to the needs of the participants and trainers.</P><P>The FLIP&amp;FLAP programme is a 2-day or a 2.5-day course, consisting of continuous sessions (14 hours and 16 hours, respectively) in which parents and children (aged 8 to 11 years) or adolescents (aged 12 to 16 years) are taught separately from one another in groups of 5-8 families. It consists of detailed manuals for trainers and a diverse range age-related teaching material so that participants can understand seizures better and develop a more adequate self-concept of the disease. This includes a film about seizures, two rag dolls called Flip and Flap, a game about epilepsy facts, a comic book for children and an information booklet for parents. Delivered by two trainers (healthcare professionals: nurses, social workers, doctors or psychologists), the courses include the following seven domains.</P><UL><LI>Disease knowledge: understanding of the disease through information on the pathophysiology of the condition and treatment appropriate to participants' age and needs.</LI><LI>Disease-related emotions: discussion of shared emotions such as anxiety, guilt or embarrassment and coping strategies.</LI><LI>Communication: dialogue among children, adolescents, parents and healthcare professionals is encouraged.</LI><LI>Self-responsibility: children, adolescents and parents are encouraged to share responsibility for managing the disease, particularly to counteract parental tendency for overprotection.</LI><LI>Self-management: children and adolescents are encouraged to be self-reliant, particularly in relation to taking medication and choice of leisure activities.</LI><LI>Participation: families are encouraged to question their expectations of stigmatisation and to cope with aspects of the disease openly and confidently; children and adolescents are encouraged to participate socially.</LI><LI>Educational insecurity: educational counselling and further information on diagnostic possibilities is provided for parents.</LI></UL><P>Central to the programme is the FLIP&amp;FLAP story. Using children's expressions and speech patterns, this story is of the teamwork that happens between the 'Flaps' (the 'clumsy' nerve cells) and the 'Flips' (the strong and fit colleagues of the 'Flaps'). The children's course deals with all contents through play. In the adolescents' programme, connections are made between the FLIP&amp;FLAP model and more scientific explanations of epilepsy through non-directive learning. Particularly for parents, illustrated exemplary case studies serve as stimulants for discussion and understanding.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;7 studies included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;138 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;995 records excluded based on information from the title and abstract&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;1134 records identified as potentially relevant to the review&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 8188 records identified through database searching&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;11 additional records identified through other sources&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;131 full-text articles excluded, with reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226;107 intervention aimed at wrong population (e.g. adults or mostly adults, non-epileptic seizures, etc) or not an intervention specific to epilepsy self-management&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8226;21 wrong type of publication (e.g. study design)&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8226;2 no relevant outcomes (or no outcomes at all)&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8226;1 duplicate of study already included&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
