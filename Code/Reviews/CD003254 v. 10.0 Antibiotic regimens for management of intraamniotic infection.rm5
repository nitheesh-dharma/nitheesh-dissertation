<P>Antibiotics are used to prevent life-threatening complications for mother and baby when the amniotic fluid is infected, but it is not known which antibiotic is best.</P>
<P>Amniotic fluid is the 'water' surrounding the baby inside the womb. If this fluid becomes infected, it can be life-threatening for the mother and baby, and the baby should be born within 12 hours. Infection can come from bacteria entering the womb from the vagina, or from a medical procedure that penetrates the membranes ('bag' around baby and waters). Antibiotics reduce the risk of dangerous complications for both mother and baby. The review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show which antibiotic is best or whether it should be given before or after the baby is born.</P>

<P>Two eligible trials (181 women) were included in this review. No trials were identified that compared antibiotic treatment with no treatment.

There was no difference in the incidence of maternal bacteremia (RR 2.19; CI 0.25, 19.48). There was no difference in the outcomes of neonatal sepsis (RR 2.16; CI 0.20, 23.21) or neonatal death (RR 0.72; CI 0.12, 4.16) between a regimen with and without anaerobic activity (number of women studied = 133). There was a trend towards a decrease in the incidence of post-partum endometritis in women who received treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone, but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.54; CI 0.19, 1.49).</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-09 21:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Clinically evident intraamniotic infection (IAI) occurs in approximately one per cent of pregnancies and is potentially a serious infectious complication, leading to increased maternal and infant morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1985</LINK>). Several alternative terms for intraamniotic infection are in widespread use and include chorioamnionitis, amnionitis, uterine infection and amniotic fluid infection. Intraamniotic infection occurs when there is bacterial infection of the uterine cavity and amniotic fluid and is usually a result of ascending infection from the vagina to the uterine cavity. Infection is often polymicrobial. The principal pathogens include Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, Group B streptococci and anaerobic streptococci. Occasionally infection is due to hematogenous dissemination of bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes (<LINK REF="REF-Schuchat-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuchat 1992</LINK>). A third mechanism for the development of intraamniotic infection is the introduction of bacteria during an invasive procedure, for example, amniocentesis, intrauterine fetal blood transfusion, and cervical cerclage (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1985</LINK>). Several risk factors have been identified for the development of intrapartum intraamniotic infection. Only the duration of labor, duration of membrane rupture, use of internal fetal monitoring devices and number of vaginal examinations are independently associated with the development of intraamniotic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soper-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The usual presenting clinical manifestations of intraamniotic infection include fever associated with maternal and fetal tachycardia. Uterine tenderness and purulent amniotic fluid may be present also but are usually late manifestations. The membranes may or may not be intact and labor may or may not be present (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a significant risk of both maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with intraamniotic infection. In addition to the initiation of labor, intraamniotic infection may lead to postpartum endometritis and also more serious infectious sequelae such as septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Westover-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westover 1995</LINK>). Infected fetuses can rapidly decompensate during labor. They may be born with fulminant sepsis and subsequently die in the neonatal period or be developmentally delayed. Infants exposed to intrauterine infection can present with neonatal encephalopathy and may be at an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 2002</LINK>). Delivery is indicated once a diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is established. Few data exist, however, to indicate the optimal time frame in which to effect delivery. From the available evidence, a diagnosis to delivery interval of up to twelve hours is not associated with increased neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1985</LINK>). In both of these studies, maternal parenteral antibiotic administration was commenced at diagnosis. Whether to begin parenteral antibiotic administration immediately after making the diagnosis or after delivery has been controversial. While immediate administration of antibiotics may limit maternal sepsis, intrapartum antibiotic therapy could obscure the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis and affect the management of the infant. Side effects associated with antibiotic therapy include allergic reactions, renal toxicity, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the consequences of the development of antimicrobial resistance. A variety of regimens, effective against the most common organisms, have been used to treat intraamniotic infection on an empirical basis. Usually treatment is with a penicillin and gentamicin with or without the addition of clindamycin, but there is no consensus on the most appropriate regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 1985</LINK>). </P>

<P>All potential trials were selected for eligibility according to the criteria specified in the protocol and data were extracted from each publication by two reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. In addition to the main outcome measures listed above, information on the setting of the study (country, type of population, socioeconomic status), a description of the antibiotic regimen used (drug, dose, frequency and timing), characteristics of the pregnancies (gestational age, labor, membrane status) and definitions of outcome as well as intraamniotic infection (if provided) was collected. Trials were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane criteria of adequacy of allocation concealment: adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C), or that allocation concealment was not used (D). Subgroup analyses to examine: (1) the effect of high quality trials (defined as adequate allocation concealment), and (2) the effect of infection occurring at term versus preterm on outcomes was performed. Information on blinding of outcome assessment and loss to follow-up was collected. Where data were available, an intent to treat analysis was performed. The main comparison of treatment schemes was not stratified according to gestational age, membrane status, or presence and duration of labor. Separate comparisons of different antimicrobial regimens were made. Summary relative risks were calculated using a fixed effects model (or a random effects model if statistically significant heterogeneity among trials was observed).</P>

<P>Fifteen trials, published between 1956 and 1998, were examined for inclusion in the review but thirteen were excluded because they were not randomized controlled trials or did not fit the selection criteria specified in the review (for a detailed description of the reasons for exclusion, see table of 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). Both trials included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maberry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maberry 1991</LINK>) were conducted in the United States. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1988</LINK> enrolled 48 women; 133 women were included in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Maberry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maberry 1991</LINK>. Criteria listed to define the presence of intraamniotic infection were consistent. The antimicrobial agents used in the trials included ampicillin and gentamicin with the addition of clindamycin to one of the arms in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Maberry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maberry 1991</LINK>. All infants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1988</LINK> received ampicillin and gentamicin for at least 72 hours after delivery; the majority of the infants in the study from <LINK REF="STD-Maberry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maberry 1991</LINK>received ampicillin and gentamicin for at least 48 hours after delivery.

(Five reports from an updated search in April 2010 have been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.)</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the included study by <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1988</LINK>, randomization by sealed envelopes and lack of blinding weaken the study design but endpoints were well defined. The investigators and the Safety Committee agreed to stop this study after 48 patients had been enrolled based on the preliminary results; a sample size of 92 patients had been planned. Specific maternal and infant side-effects of therapy were not sought. Follow-up for infant infectious complications in the neonatal period appeared to be complete. Three of 22 women randomized to postpartum treatment were excluded from the analysis because of protocol violations: two women received intrapartum antibiotics and neonatal blood cultures were not collected in a third. An intent to treat analysis was not performed. In the included study by <LINK REF="STD-Maberry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maberry 1991</LINK>, randomization was by a table of random numbers. There is no mention as to whether the study was blinded but again, endpoints were well-defined. All women enrolled were included in the analysis.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>No trials were identified that compared antibiotic treatment with no treatment. Intrapartum treatment with antibiotics for intraamniotic infection was associated with a reduction in neonatal sepsis (relative risk (RR) 0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00,1.44) and pneumonia (RR 0.15; CI 0.01, 2.92) compared with treatment given immediately postpartum, but these results did not reach statistical significance (number of women studied = 45). One neonatal death occurred in an infant whose mother received antibiotics post-partum. There was no difference in the incidence of maternal bacteremia (RR 2.19; CI 0.25, 19.48). </P>
<P>There was no evidence to support the use of a more broad-spectrum regimen than ampicillin and gentamicin for the treatment of intraamniotic infection. There was no difference in the outcomes of neonatal sepsis (RR 2.16; CI 0.20, 23.21) or neonatal death (RR 0.72; CI 0.12, 4.16) between a regimen with and without anaerobic activity (number of women studied = 133). There was a trend towards a decrease in the incidence of post-partum endometritis in women who received treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone, but this result did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.54; CI 0.19, 1.49).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The conclusions that can be drawn from this meta-analysis are limited due to the small number of studies and the early discontinuation of enrollment in one of them. For none of the outcomes was a statistically significant difference seen bbetweenthe different interventions. Current consensus within the clinical community is for the intrapartum administration of antibiotics when the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is made; a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin is often recommended. The results of this review, however, neither supports nor confirms this approach although the trend in improved neonatal outcomes was when antibiotics were administered intrapartum. No recommendations can be made on the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen to choose to treat intraamniotic infection. The quality of evidence supporting the current approach is poor and current practice is not based on evidence from well-designed cclinicaltrials, but rather on expert opinion, descriptive studies and clinical experience.</P>

<P>Future research should be directed at recognizing the risk factors for the development of intraamniotic infection and clarifying what interventions and preventative strategies can be effective in reducing the incidence of infection. Although the trend was towards improved neonatal outcomes when antibiotics were administered intrapartum, adverse neonatal events associated with antibiotic administration were not specifically sought. Further trials should be designed to look at longer term outcomes, including the consequences of neonatal cerebral damage, provide a thorough understanding of the pharmcokinetic profile of the drugs administered intrapartum and evaluate more comprehensively the effectiveness of different regimens.</P>
