<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-28 10:11:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic low-back pain is a very common problem for which there is currently no universally effective treatment. Patients with chronic low-back pain have many treatment options and it is important for them to understand the evidence behind each treatment option they may be considering. Prolotherapy injections have been used to treat chronic low-back pain for over 50 years but their use remains controversial. They involve repeatedly injecting ligaments with compounds such as dextrose (sugar) and lidocaine (anaesthetic) to help restart the body's natural healing process by causing controlled acute inflammation (swelling) in the areas injected. Proponents believe this leads to stronger ligaments that can better support the low-back. Prolotherapy injections are often combined with other treatments such as spinal manipulation, exercises, and corticosteroid injections into tender muscles to maximize its effect.</P>
<P>This review included five studies that examined the effects of prolotherapy injections on 366 patients with low-back pain that had lasted for longer than three months. Because these studies used different types of prolotherapy injections and different treatment protocols, their results could not be combined. The five studies we examined were therefore divided according to whether they used prolotherapy injections alone or combined prolotherapy injections with spinal manipulation, exercise, and other treatments. Of the five studies we reviewed, three found that prolotherapy injections alone were not an effective treatment for chronic low-back pain and two found that a combination of prolotherapy injections, spinal manipulation, exercises, and other treatments can help chronic low-back pain and disability. Minor side effects such as increased back pain and stiffness were common but short-lived. Based on these five studies, the role of prolotherapy injections for chronic low-back pain is still not clear.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:02:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>We searched CENTRAL 2006, Issue 3 and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED from their respective beginnings to October 2006, with no restrictions on language, and consulted content experts. Literature search was updated on July 29th, 2009. No new RCTs were identified.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCT) that compared prolotherapy injections to control injections, alone or in combination with other treatments, which measured pain or disability before and after the intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected the trials and assessed methodological quality. Intervention protocols varied from study to study, making meta-analysis impossible. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-28 10:11:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified five high quality studies with a total of 366 participants. All measured pain or disability levels at six months, and four measured the proportion of participants reporting a greater than 50% reduction in pain or disability scores.</P>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials (206 participants) found that prolotherapy injections alone are no more effective than control injection for chronic low-back pain and disability. At six months, there was no difference between groups in mean pain or disability scores (2 RCTs; 184 participants) and no difference in proportions who reported over 50% improvement in pain or disability (3 RCTs; 206 participants). These trials could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Two RCTs (160 participants) found that prolotherapy injections, given with spinal manipulation, exercise, and other therapies, are more effective than control injections for chronic low-back pain and disability. At six months, one study reported a significant difference between groups in mean pain and disability scores, whereas the other study did not. Both studies reported a significant difference in the proportion of individuals who reported over 50% reduction in disability or pain. Co-interventions confounded interpretation of results and clinical heterogeneity in the trials prevented pooling.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of prolotherapy injections for patients with chronic low-back pain. When used alone, prolotherapy is not an effective treatment for chronic low-back pain. When combined with spinal manipulation, exercise, and other co-interventions, prolotherapy may improve chronic low-back pain and disability. Conclusions are confounded by clinical heterogeneity amongst studies and by the presence of co-interventions. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:03:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic low-back pain places an enormous burden on society, in terms of both patient suffering and cost (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 2006</LINK>). This makes the search for more effective treatments a priority in research. Prolotherapy (also called ligament sclerotherapy) is an injection-based treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Its proposed mode of action is the reduction of joint instability through the strengthening of stretched or torn ligaments (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1997</LINK>). Its most common application in the back is chronic non-specific low-back pain that has not responded to other therapies. Protocols for prolotherapy for back pain in scientific studies to date vary, but all include the injection of an irritant (proliferant) solution into ligaments and tendinous attachments at weekly or fortnightly intervals for three to eight treatments.</P>
<P>Proponents of prolotherapy believe that ligament injections trigger an influx of granulocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts, the release of growth factors and ultimately, collagen deposition. They hypothesise that this leads to strengthening of ligaments and a reduction in pain and disability. There are three major classes of proliferants commonly used in prolotherapy -- the irritants, the chemotactics and the osmotics (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 1991</LINK>). There is some overlap in their purported actions. Irritants act by either damaging cells directly or by rendering the cells antigenic through alteration of surface proteins. Irritants include phenol, guaiacol and tannic acid. There is another category of irritants called particulates, exemplified by pumice flour. These act by triggering cellular trauma following injection into target tissues, and by directly attracting macrophages, which ingest them and secrete polypeptide growth factors. Chemotactics also act by attracting inflammatory cells. The only agent in this class is sodium morrhuate. The osmotic class of proliferants includes concentrated solutions of glucose, glycerin and zinc sulphate. They act by causing an osmotic shock to cells leading to the release of pro-inflammatory substances. Local anaesthetic (commonly lignocaine) is often added to proliferant solutions to reduce the pain of the irritant injections. An increase in mass and thickness in animal and human ligaments has been demonstrated in response to repeated injections of a commonly used solution containing glucose (dextrose), glycerine, phenol and lignocaine (lidocaine) (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>Prolotherapy injections are often supplemented by co-interventions to enhance its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>). Prior to commencing prolotherapy injections, these may include, alone or in any combination, triamcinolone injections into hypersensitive tender points, infiltration of lumbosacral ligaments with lignocaine, or spinal manipulation with or without intravenous sedation and analgesia. During and after the course of prolotherapy injections, co-interventions may include, alone or in any combination, lumbar flexion and extension exercises to induce optimal strengthening of the treated ligaments, regular walking, encouragement to recommence previously painful activities, paracetamol, corsets, instructions on back care, and use of oral vitamin C, zinc and manganese supplements, ostensibly to facilitate collagen growth. Use of oral anti-inflammatory medications is discouraged during the treatment period as this may, in theory, suppress the inflammation triggered by the prolotherapy injections and reduce its long-term effects.</P>
<P>The original Cochrane review on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Yelland-2004B" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelland 2004B</LINK>) was conducted to focus solely on prolotherapy injections, following an earlier Cochrane review of all injection therapies for low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2003</LINK>) in which the only treatment that showed significant, sustained reductions in pain and disability at six months involved prolotherapy injections (<LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>). Following the publication of the original review, it was brought to our attention that a potentially relevant study had been overlooked. Since two years had passed since its publication, this review was updated to search for additional studies, as recommended by the Cochrane author guidelines.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this updated review is to determine the efficacy of prolotherapy injections in reducing pain and disability in chronic low-back pain in adults, aged 18 and older. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:03:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCT; using, for example, birth date to assign participants to groups) that compared prolotherapy injections to control injections or other therapies. We included trials with co-interventions. Trials had to include measures of pain or disability before and after the intervention.</P>
<P>We excluded non-randomised controlled studies and non-controlled experimental studies such as case series. There were no limits on publication dates of trials or language of publication. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We selected studies that included participants aged 18 years and over, with a history of non-specific low-back pain longer than three months duration. Low-back pain was defined as pain in the lumbar region, with or without pain in the sacral region, gluteal regions and radiation to the lower extremities. Exclusion criteria in studies were lumbar/sacral radiculopathies and pathological causes of back pain, such as infection, neoplasm, metastasis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or fractures. The presence of participants with unresolved litigation or compensation claims was not a reason for exclusion.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>For inclusion, prolotherapy injections had to be administered to at least one group within the trial. Comparison groups could include injections with a control solution or a different therapy not involving injections. For chronic non-specific low-back pain, the prolotherapy solutions are injected into the ligaments and tendons regarded as the sources of the pain. The choice of injection sites is determined either by a standard list of points (<LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>) or by the patterns of pain and tenderness (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1997</LINK>). The skin through which injections are given at each treatment visit is anaesthetised with wheals of local anaesthetic. The number of injection treatments ranges from three to eight and the interval between treatments commonly ranges from one to two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>). Co-interventions used with prolotherapy injections vary with different protocols and are described in the background section above and the table of <I>Characteristics of Included Studies.</I>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcome measures, the differences between groups in each study were expressed as the relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For between-group comparisons of continuous measures, the effect size was estimated as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI to accommodate the different scales used in each study. An effect size between 0.2 and 0.5 was considered a small effect size, between 0.5 and 0.8 a medium effect size, and of 0.8 or more a large effect size (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>We evaluated clinical homogeneity by exploring the differences between the RCTs with regard to study population, types of interventions in treatment and control groups and the types of comparisons and outcomes. We decided against pooling of the study results because of the clinical heterogeneity amongst intervention groups and amongst control groups. No two studies tested the same component(s) of treatment or had the same number of injection treatments.</P>

Three of these co-interventions, the initial lignocaine injections into ligaments, the manipulation following these injections, and the injection of muscle tender points with triamcinolone/lignocaine, were not blinded to the treating doctor, but the prolotherapy injections given by a different doctor were double-blinded. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK> fulfilled all 11 criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK> fulfilled nine of the criteria as it was unclear if treatment allocation was concealed and whether the care provider was blinded to the type of injections given. <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK> had a factorial design to test the efficacy of prolotherapy injections and exercises in the same study. It fulfilled all 11 criteria for the injections factor and nine of the criteria for the exercises factor, as the care provider was not blinded to the exercise status of participants. <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> fulfilled six of the criteria as interventions were not blinded to the treating doctor, it was unclear if treatment allocation was concealed, if compliance was acceptable in all groups, if the outcome measure (i.e. six-point visual analogue scale used to create three categories of improvement) was relevant, and if intention-to-treat analysis was used.

<P>The protocols for experimental and control groups were complex and varied, making inter-trial comparisons difficult. They are outlined in the table of <I>Characteristics of Included Studies</I>. No study had a control group that did not receive injections. Within each study, the experimental and control groups received similar protocols of ligament injections, but with different solutions. <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK> compared glucose/glycerine/phenol/lignocaine solution with a normal saline control solution, while <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK> compared glucose/glycerine/phenol/lignocaine solution with a lignocaine control solution, <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK> compared a glucose/lignocaine solution with a saline solution, and <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> compared phenol/dextrose/glycerine/procaine solution with a procaine control solution.</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK> differed markedly from the other three studies by administering only three injection treatments (compared with at least six in the other studies) and injecting only 10 ml of solution during each treatment (compared with at least 20 ml in the other studies). <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK> also tested the effect of the exercise co-intervention using a factorial design, with independent random allocation of participants to either exercises or normal activity. This design allowed separate analysis of the attributable effects of the injections and the exercises. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK> tested several co-interventions with allocation tied to the injection group. The day before commencing the course of prolotherapy injections, the experimental group received initial triamcinolone/lignocaine injections into muscle tender points and high dose lignocaine injections into ligaments followed by manipulation, whereas the control group had lignocaine-only injections into muscle tender points and then low dose lignocaine injections into ligaments followed by a sham manipulation. This design made it impossible to attribute any effect to a single component of the treatment protocol. <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> gave injections into lumbosacral ligaments for the experimental group while the control group received injections in an unspecified tender spot, confounding results by varying both the solution injected and the location of injections.</P>

Pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) in all studies, with the addition of a McGill Pain Questionnaire in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK>), a six-point numerical rating scale in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>), and a pain drawing grid score in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>).

Four studies reported mean scores for these outcomes at zero and six months, whereas one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>) used pain to classify participants in three pain categories (no further pain/occasional further pain/constant pain) without reporting mean scores.

For <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>, a dichotomous outcome was created by combining the first two pain categories (no further pain/occasional further pain), which was considered equivalent to the classification used in three other studies (i.e. more than 50% reduction in pain scores). Several secondary outcomes, including physical performance testing and medication usage were reported, but not consistently across studies. Follow-up periods were six months for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>), twelve months for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>), and twenty four months for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Study Selection</HEADING>
<P>Despite an extensive search, only five articles on prolotherapy injections for chronic low-back pain were identified for review. The treatment and control group protocols varied from study to study, making both meta-analysis and levels of evidence summaries impossible. Consequently, the conclusions of this review are based on the results of individual studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological Quality</HEADING>
<P>The quality of studies was high, with four of five (80%) studies meeting nine or more of the 11 criteria used for the assessment of internal validity. <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK> all met the important criteria of allocation concealment and blinding of the treating doctor to the composition of the injection solution. It was unclear whether <LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> met these criteria. Outcome assessment was blinded in all studies, but as the primary outcomes were self-assessed pain and disability, this criterion is less important than in studies where primary outcomes are measured objectively by an assessor.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy of Prolotherapy Injections</HEADING>
<P>It is challenging to interpret current evidence regarding the efficacy of prolotherapy injections for the treatment of chronic low-back pain since conclusions are confounded by clinical heterogeneity amongst studies and by the presence of co-interventions. Three studies that compared prolotherapy injections directly against control injections found no evidence that they are more effective (<LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>), whereas two studies that compared prolotherapy injections and spinal manipulation, exercise, and other co-interventions against control injections with or without those co-interventions reported benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>). One of these latter studies reported a greater proportion achieving more than 50% improvement in pain or disability (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>), but not for mean pain or disability scores. The study with the most positive results in this review - and in the previous Cochrane review on injection treatments for back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2003</LINK>) - demonstrated that prolotherapy injections combined with spinal manipulation, exercise, and other co-interventions are more effective than control injections combined with control co-interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>). However, this study failed to define the contribution of the prolotherapy injections to the effectiveness of treatment, making it impossible to attribute improvements solely to prolotherapy injections. Further research will be necessary to reconcile these conflicting findings.</P>
<P>The confounding effect of co-interventions raises important questions about the active component(s) of treatment in prolotherapy protocols. Of note were the significant and sustained reductions in pain and disability in both the intervention and control groups of studies with six or more injection treatments with at least 20 ml of solution, in contrast with the lack of response in the study with three injection treatments with 10 ml of solution. This raises the question of a dose-response phenomenon with injections in the treatment of chronic low-back pain. However, in the absence of a study with randomisation to different doses of treatment, it would be improper to extrapolate a dose-response phenomenon for injections. An alternative explanation of this phenomenon is that a non-specific effect of increased contact with a confident and caring practitioner led to the improvement.</P>
<P>In all studies, part of the response, in both treatment and control groups, may be attributed to 'regression to the mean', the natural history of the back complaint, or both. The phenomenon of 'regression to the mean' results from an increased motivation by people to join trials when their problem is at its worst, making spontaneous improvement more likely. The natural history of low-back pain that is as long-standing as that described in the included studies is unclear, although evidence from a longitudinal study suggests that the longer the back pain is consistently reported, the more likely it is to persist (<LINK REF="REF-Smedley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smedley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mean duration of pain in the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>) showing sustained improvement in both treatment and control groups exceeded eight years, making it difficult to attribute much of the observed improvement to natural history. These three studies were also the studies with multiple co-interventions including an initial infiltration of ligaments with local anaesthetic followed by manipulation under sedation, superficial skin injections of local anaesthetic, the injection of gluteal tender points with triamcinolone/lignocaine, encouragement to perform previously painful activities (activation), vitamin and mineral supplements and flexion/extension exercises. One study specifically examined the effect of the flexion/extension exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK>) and found they were no more effective than normal activity. <LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>, the only one to show a clear difference between treatment and control groups in all relevant outcomes, has been construed in another review as evidence of the efficacy of manipulation (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). However, it fails to support the efficacy of manipulation just as it fails to support the efficacy of prolotherapy injections, because the intervention group differed from the control group in four respects - the pre-manipulation injections, the manipulation, the muscle tender point injections and the prolotherapy injections.</P>
<P>In response to these criticisms, a subsequent study by the same group of investigators attempted to made the glucose/glycerine/phenol components of the proliferant solution the only variable between treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK>). In their study, which involved six injection treatments, the prolotherapy group had a statistically significant advantage over the control group in the proportion of participants showing more than 50% reduction in scores from baseline to six months. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in mean pain and disability scores unless those with hyperirritable gluteal tender points were excluded from the analysis. In their discussion, Klein et al considered a gradual denervating effect of the phenol component as a possible mechanism of pain relief. However, <LINK REF="STD-Dechow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dechow 1999</LINK>, which used the same components of the injection solution (but with only three injection treatments of 10 ml compared with six injections of 20 to 30 ml), showed no such response and no significant differences between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2004A" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2004A</LINK> evaluated the effects of glucose/lignocaine injections and found they resulted in no greater improvement than saline injections. However, both the prolotherapy and control groups in this study demonstrated significant and sustained reductions in pain and disability scores over a two-year period. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK> compared phenol/dextrose/glycerine/procaine solution injections to procaine injections and found no difference in pain improvement between groups at three, six, or 12 months.</P>
<P>Collectively, these findings leave many questions unanswered about the efficacy and mechanism of action of prolotherapy injections. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1993</LINK> considered a gradual denervating effect of the phenol component as a possible mechanism of pain relief. Alternatively, the beneficial effect could be attributed to the needles rather than the specific injection solution, by a counter-irritation effect. This has been shown elsewhere to inhibit pain in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Reinert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinert 2000</LINK>). Finally, the original hypothesis that reductions in pain and disability stem from strengthening of ligaments by prolotherapy injections has been neither confirmed nor refuted by the evidence provided by the five studies.</P>
<P>Prolotherapy injections are not without adverse events, with the majority of participants experiencing a transient increase in pain and stiffness and a few per cent with severe headaches suggestive of lumbar puncture. However, no serious or permanent adverse events were reported. Patients considering prolotherapy should balance the possibility of transient adverse events against the potential benefits of this therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Given the present studies, prolotherapy injections alone do not have evidence of a role in the treatment of chronic low-back pain. However, repeated ligament injections, irrespective of the solution used, may give prolonged partial relief of pain and disability as part of a multimodal treatment programme when combined with spinal manipulation and exercise. Transient increases in pain and stiffness are likely with such treatment, but serious adverse events are unlikely.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to elucidate the effects of prolotherapy injections. These studies should also investigate the specific effects of the most common co-interventions to prolotherapy injections, such as superficial and deep injections of local anaesthetic, manipulation and vitamin/mineral supplements. Further research is needed into the predictors of treatment success, so that it can be better targeted to those who may benefit from it. </P>
<P>Apart from one non-randomised pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Yelland-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yelland 2000</LINK>), no studies have compared prolotherapy with non-injection therapies. There is a need for RCTs in this area. There is also a need for RCTs on prolotherapy for discogenic back pain confirmed by discography, following promising results from a pilot study of this treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Was the method of randomisation adequate? A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer-generated random numbers table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the treatment allocation concealed? Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the patient blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
<P>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable? The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</P>
<P>Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.</P>
<P>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Were co-interventions avoided or similar? Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or be similar between the index and control groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the compliance acceptable in all groups? The review author determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar? Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.<BR/>

<BR/>The EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and AMED databases were also searched using OVID. Search strategies combined terms recommended by the Cochrane Back Review group (van Tulder 2003) with additional terms specific to this intervention, as noted above in #43-50. Search terms for these databases are available by contacting the primary author (simon@camresearch.com).</P>
