<TITLE MODIFIED="2011-08-17 16:54:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">The effect of caffeine in people with asthma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:57:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, cola drinks and cocoa. Caffeine is a drug that is very similar to theophylline. Theophylline is a bronchodilator drug that is taken to open up the airways in the lungs and therefore relieve the symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, coughing and breathlessness. Scientists are interested in finding out whether caffeine has the same effect on the lungs as theophylline.</P>
<P>There are two major reasons why it is important to know if caffeine is a bronchodilator. The first is because it may be beneficial for asthmatics to take caffeine in order to relieve the symptoms of asthma. The second is because consuming caffeine may affect the results of important tests that determine how bad someone's asthma is.</P>
<P>If caffeine acts as a bronchodilator and widens the airways, then a patient who has consumed caffeine before taking the test would show a better result in a lung function test than they would have if they had not consumed any caffeine. The potential problem with this is that if the test results are better than expected doctors may prescribe a lower dose or a weaker drug than is really necessary, which can lead to problems with asthma management.</P>
<P>This review carefully examines all the available high-quality clinical trials on caffeine in asthma. This review was conducted to discover if people should avoid consuming caffeine before taking lung function tests.</P>
<P>This review found that even small amounts of caffeine can improve lung function for up to four hours. Therefore caffeine can affect the result of a lung function test (e.g. spirometry) and so caffeine should be avoided before taking a lung function test if possible, and previous caffeine consumption should be recorded.</P>
<P>It is not known if taking caffeine leads to improvements in symptoms. It may be that in order to improve the symptoms of asthma, caffeine is needed in such large amounts that the drug's adverse effects would become a problem, so more research is needed.</P>
<P>Another clinical trial looked at the effect of caffeine on exhaled nitric oxide levels and found that there is no significant effect, so it appears unlikely that patients would need to avoid caffeine before taking this type of test. However, this is the result of just a single study so more research is needed to clarify this.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-06-15 14:52:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-02 11:00:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine has a variety of pharmacological effects; it is a weak bronchodilator and it also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue. It is chemically related to the drug theophylline which is used to treat asthma. It has been suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms and interest has been expressed in its potential role as an asthma treatment. A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma; this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-09-29 13:03:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>To assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to either lung function or exhaled nitric oxide testing.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-15 14:52:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles (August 2011), an updated search in June 2011 yielded one potentially relevant article which has been added to 'studies awaiting classification'. We also contacted study authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-08-17 17:01:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included randomised trials (RCTs) of oral caffeine compared to placebo or coffee compared to decaffeinated coffee in adults with asthma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:56:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently carried out trial selection, quality assessment and data extraction.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:57:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials involving a total of 75 people with mild to moderate asthma. The studies were all of cross-over design.</P>
<P>Six trials involving 55 people showed that in comparison with placebo, caffeine, even at a 'low dose' (less than 5 mg/kg body weight), appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine ingestion (standardised mean difference 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.20), which translates into a 5% mean difference in FEV1. However in two studies the mean differences in FEV1 were 12% and 18% after caffeine. Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours.</P>
<P>One trial involving 20 people examined the effect of drinking coffee versus a decaffeinated variety on the exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with asthma and concluded that there was no significant effect on this outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:57:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-02 11:13:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:57:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine has been widely consumed throughout the world for centuries. It is used for both non-medical and medical purposes. It is ubiquitous, being found in coffee, tea, cola-flavoured soft drinks and compounds containing cocoa. Caffeine and its derivatives have therapeutic uses and are contained in medicines such as analgesics and cold remedies.</P>
<P>The general pharmacological effects of caffeine have been extensively investigated and are described in several reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Curatolo-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curatolo 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1977</LINK>). Early studies reported that caffeine improved mental performance and increased motor activity (<LINK REF="REF-Cheney-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheney 1935</LINK>) and this has been confirmed in other studies. Caffeine ingestion has also been shown to elevate oxygen consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Grollman-1930" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grollman 1930</LINK>), increase respiratory rates in disease-free patients (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1978</LINK>) and increase ventilation in patients with coronary obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Woodcock-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodcock 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Caffeine belongs to a group of chemicals called methylxanthines, along with the bronchodilator drug theophylline. As a class, these drugs have a history of use in respiratory disorders. The mechanism of action of the methylxanthines is uncertain, but is possibly due to their inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase hydrolyses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which is a messenger within the cell that regulates many functions including the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle. Methylxanthines are also competitive antagonists for adenosine receptors. One of the effects of adenosine, a chemical regulator, is that of bronchoconstriction. Methylxanthines are known to be weak bronchodilators and they also interact with respiratory muscles to reduce respiratory muscle fatigue. Some believe the latter to be more important than the former in the treatment of respiratory diseases.</P>
<P>Thus, interest has been expressed in the potential role of caffeine as a treatment in respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pagano-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 1988</LINK>). As early as 1859, Salter (in <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1984</LINK>) recommended coffee as one of the best remedies for asthma. A study of the general Italian population in 1983 by <LINK REF="REF-Pagano-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 1988</LINK> found an inverse relationship between the prevalence of bronchial asthma and the amount of coffee consumed. From this, the authors suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-09-02 10:39:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Despite the amount of information regarding caffeine and its potential effectiveness in obstructive airways diseases, no reviews have been conducted that examine the evidence in a systematic fashion. The results from such a review could have important implications for research and clinical practice.</P>

<P>Two of us (AB, EB) independently reviewed the title, abstract and key words of the references obtained from the literature search. For the 2009 and 2011 update this was done by EJW and CC.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:57:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We contacted trial authors in an effort to obtain raw and missing data for the original review. Two of us (AB, EB) independently extracted means and standard deviations or standard errors. We converted standard errors to standard deviations. Two research staff from the Division of Physiological Medicine, St. George's Hospital Medical School (Sally Spencer and Catherine O'Leary) extracted data visually from graphs. There was little variation in the data extracted by the four review authors. We used the mean figures from the four independently extracted sets in this review.</P>
<P>Only data from cross-over studies were available for inclusion in this review. Since caffeine is a short-acting agent and most studies reported washout periods, 'carryover' and 'period' effects were not considered to affect the results in an important way. They were treated as parallel designs in the analyses for the original review, but for the 2009 update we have used paired t-test results with Generic Inverse Variance pooling. In addition, since no results were reported from parallel-group studies, there was no need to provide subgroup analyses on the basis of design.</P>
<P>We entered extracted data into the Cochrane Collaboration software program (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Bukowskyj-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bukowskyj 1987</LINK>) the mean value provided in the table and that in the corresponding figure were inconsistent (value for % change FEF25-75 at 0.5 hours); this was assumed to be a misprint and therefore omitted from the meta-analysis.</P>

<LI>Specific airway conductance (Gaw/VL): 'short' (MD 30.30; 95% CI 1.08 to 59.52; one study on 18 participants).</LI>
</UL>
<P>An improvement was seen for all outcomes after ingesting caffeine compared to placebo at all recorded time frames. This effect was statistically significant in all cases except for FEV1 at the 'medium' and 'long' time frames where the confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis: 'low' dose</HEADING>
<P>Two studies on 36 participants reported FEV1 outcomes at 'low' dose. Data for the three time frame comparisons came from the following number of studies: 'short' = two studies, 'medium' = one study, 'long' = one study. For FEF25-75 only one study on 16 participants contributed data at all time frames. There were no data for Gaw/VL at this dose.</P>
<P>All lung function parameters tended to improve post caffeine ingestion compared to placebo. For FEV1, this effect was clear only at the 'short' time frame. For FEF25-75, the difference was clear at all times.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis: 'high' dose</HEADING>
<P>Four studies on 42 participants reported FEV1 outcomes at 'high' dose. Data were available for the meta-analysis from two studies at the 'short' and one study at the 'medium' time frame. No FEV1 data were reported at the 'long' time frame. For FEF25-75, one study on 16 participants only contributed data at the 'short' and 'medium' time frames. One study provided data for Gaw/VL at the 'short' time frame only.</P>
<P>Lung function was found to improve following a 'high' dose of caffeine compared to placebo for all measured outcomes. This effect was clear at the 'short' time frame only for FEV1 and FEF25-75. A clear improvement in Gaw/VL was also seen at the 'short' time frame.</P>
<P>Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 1991</LINK>) tested the effect of 'high' dose caffeine at the 'short' time frame on FEV1, but no data were extracted for inclusion into the meta-analysis in the original review. However, in correspondence, both authors reported no significant difference in bronchodilation between caffeine and placebo ingestion. For the 2009 update, data were extracted from <LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK> from the original patient data provided into FEV1 outcomes at two hours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis: FEV1 outcomes at two hours</HEADING>
<P>In order to draw an overall conclusion we felt that it would be helpful to have a comparison with as many studies side by side as possible (2009 update). Peak FEV1 readings were recorded at around two hours, so this was chosen as the best time point (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK> reported a reading of FEV1 at 45 minutes rather than two hours and these data were included in the meta-analysis. Data were extracted from the patient data provided in <LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK>. Five studies on 88 participants gave FEV1 readings at 'high' doses and one study on 20 participants gave an additional reading at 'low' dose (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). The forest plot shows improved FEV1 when patients had consumed caffeine at high dose prior to testing (SMD 0.76; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.20). There was no heterogeneity in the result (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0) indicating a good agreement in the outcome data between studies.</P>
<P>For this update we entered the paired t-test results into the review using Generic Inverse Variance pooling for the two-hour FEV1 outcome. The confidence intervals for each trial were fairly similar to those found previously, when the results had not been analysed with paired t-tests. This provides reassurance that the previous conclusions of the review are valid.</P>
<P>When analysed as % change in FEV1 the pooled result of three trials on 26 participants showed a significant benefit with caffeine at higher dose (MD 5.47%; 95% CI 1.43 to 9.52, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity in this result (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 61%), but this appears to come from <LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK>; the participants in this trial were asymptomatic and not on treatment for asthma, so would have little potential to increase their FEV1 following caffeine. If the results of the two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bukowskyj-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bukowskyj 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gong-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 1986</LINK>) are combined this gives a larger mean difference with caffeine of around 15% difference in FEV1 (MD 14.54%; 95% CI 5.35 to 23.72).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK> reported that at 60 minutes, serum caffeine levels were higher after ingesting regular caffeine-containing coffee than after decaffeinated coffee at 60 minutes (3.9 versus 0.4 mg/mL respectively).

<P>The available evidence of the effect of caffeine compared to placebo on lung function and exhaled nitric oxide from randomised controlled trials is summarised in this systematic review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:59:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For all dose strengths, caffeine compared to placebo was found to significantly improve lung function measured in terms of FEV1, FEF25-75 and Gaw/VL for up to two hours post ingestion. This effect was sustained for FEF25-75 for over four hours. Improvement was also seen in FEV1 up to this time, however this effect did not reach statistical significance. No data were available for Gaw/VL after two hours. Bronchodilation was also seen after ingesting caffeine even following a 'low' dose (5 mg/kg). For FEV1, the difference between the caffeine and placebo groups was not significant after two hours. In contrast, for FEF25-75 the effect was clear at all times, even over four hours. A clear increase following a 'high' dose of caffeine (&gt; 5 mg/kg) compared to placebo was seen in FEV1, FEF25-75 and Gaw/VL at up to two hours only. Gaw/VL outcomes were not recorded beyond two hours. At two hours, at all doses, there was an improvement in lung function after ingesting caffeine, and when reported as % increase in FEV1 this showed an average difference of 5% change (MD 5.47%; 95% CI 1.43 to 9.52). However when the study on patients who were asymptomatic and on no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Crivelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crivelli 1986</LINK>) was excluded, the change in FEV1 was higher after caffeine (MD 14.54%; 95% CI 5.35 to 23.72).</P>
<P>The size of improvements in lung function were small and at the margins of what would normally be considered clinical significance (FEV1: maximum 13.7% change from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Gong-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 1986</LINK>) or maximum 330 mL absolute change for caffeine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kivity-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kivity 1990</LINK>)). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gong-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 1986</LINK>) explicitly recorded the patients' perception: four of the nine participants reported improved breathing following ingestion of a 'high' dose of caffeine; the same information was not provided for the placebo group.</P>
<P>Concerns have been raised as to whether caffeine interferes with the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide levels, based on a randomised study in non-asthmatic healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 2002</LINK>). The only randomised study to date in a small sample of people with mild asthma did not identify a significant difference between a cup of coffee made with 15 g of grounds and a similar cup made with decaffeinated coffee (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Additional studies would help to determine whether this finding is valid.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-09-02 11:00:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparison of the findings across studies was complicated by the use of five different doses of caffeine, different outcome measures recorded at different times, and different methods of reporting outcomes. To permit the aggregation of data we grouped the trials according to dose and time. Similarly, we made analyses using the SMD where the combined trials used different units of measurement for the same variable. Despite this, few data were available to be combined in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The dose of caffeine tested varied greatly between studies, from 5 to 10 mg/kg. In an effort to make this more meaningful in dietary terms, most authors related doses to cups of coffee. However, the average amount of caffeine per cup is quoted as between 30 to 150 mg, although 150 mg was most commonly stated. Consequently, the number of cups of coffee required to produce bronchodilation is reported from one to five cups.</P>
<P>One method of standardising the dose ingested between studies would be to examine the peak serum levels. The reported peak serum levels vary greatly: from 5.4 mg/L (<LINK REF="STD-Colacone-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Colacone 1990</LINK>) to 18.8 mg/L (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 1991</LINK>). Interestingly, the study reporting serum caffeine level of 18.8 mg/L after a dose of caffeine (10 mg/kg) found no increase in FEV1, although a later protective effect against bronchoconstriction post broncho provocation challenge test was found (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 1991</LINK>). These data were not presented in a way that would enable extraction for entry into the meta-analysis. Peak serum levels of caffeine tended to occur at 45 or 60 minutes post caffeine intake. However, a clear difference between caffeine and placebo was seen even four hours post ingestion (<LINK REF="STD-Bukowskyj-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bukowskyj 1987</LINK>). Few studies reported measurements beyond four hours post dosing. However, serum caffeine was detected in some patients at baseline. It is not known whether this would affect the potential for bronchodilation, especially where lung function outcomes were reported in terms of change from baseline. Even consideration of the peak serum levels would not fully compensate for this.</P>
<P>The findings of any review are only applicable to the characteristics of the participants taking part in the included studies. Although a standardised definition was not used across the studies, participants were described as having mild or moderate asthma, therefore results may not be generalisable to those with more severe asthma. Most subjects were described as having stable or asymptomatic asthma, but how this was assessed was not described. Similarly, patients' treatment regimens varied greatly across the trials and the effect of this was not studied.</P>
<P>It could be argued that insufficient data were presented on side effects resulting from caffeine, however the studies were designed not to asses the long-term effects of caffeine, but instead to assess the short-term impact of ingesting caffeine on lung function and exhaled nitric oxide tests. The side effects of caffeine are similar to those of theophylline (tachycardia, palpitation, nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia).</P>
<P>The issue arising from this review is not whether caffeine should or should not be used as a bronchodilator in preference for theophylline or whether the side effects are sufficient to override this benefit. Instead the issue is whether or not the amount of caffeine ingested in a cup of coffee (or two) is sufficient to alter the result of a lung function test. This may be important if coffee drinkers show better results in lung function tests than they would achieve if they did not drink coffee. The evidence presented here shows that taking a 'normal' amount of caffeine, equivalent to one to five cups of coffee, is enough to alter the results of a lung function test. Therefore patients should be advised not to drink coffee for four hours before taking a lung function test. Drinking coffee before taking a FeNO test does not affect the results according to the single-study data presented here, although further data are necessary to clarify. The long-term impact of drinking coffee was not studied in these trials or reviewed here.</P>

<P>Interpretation of the results of this review must include consideration of methodological limitations. All of the studies employed a cross-over design. Although the method of allocation was in all cases reported to be randomised, none of the authors assessed order effects, and only two authors explicitly stated that the patients could not discern which treatment they had received (<LINK REF="STD-Bukowskyj-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bukowskyj 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gong-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 1986</LINK>). Sample sizes were small and the existence or effect of outlying values were rarely discussed. Outlying values are important in small studies using cross-over designs, as each subject provides a large proportion of the data.</P>
<P>This review was restricted to an analysis of clinically relevant data in terms of a patient response and excluded the scientific issue of whether caffeine affects airway response to bronchoconstricting agents.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-09-02 12:22:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The possibility of publication bias (non-publication of negative studies) should be considered given that only small differences in bronchodilator effect were found between caffeine and placebo. However, we used a comprehensive search strategy and searched for unpublished trials in an attempt to minimise this bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-09-02 11:00:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine, even at 'low' doses, has been found to improve lung function for at least four hours after ingestion. One trial using the most sensitive outcome measurements (FEF25-75) showed that effects are sustained for over four hours post ingestion. It is therefore recommended that patients be advised to withhold caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing. Alternatively lung function tests results should be considered in light of caffeine ingested within four hours of the start of the test, as coffee drinkers may present with a better lung function test result than if they had not consumed so much caffeine. Caffeine does not appear to have a significant effect on exhaled nitric oxide levels.</P>
<P>With regard to advice to patients, caffeine ingestion may improve lung function in the short term. However, these trial data do not indicate whether the effect reaches a threshold for clinical significance in terms of an improvement of symptoms or quality of life. This was not the purpose of trials examined in this review. It is not known if tolerance to the bronchodilatory effects of caffeine develops in habitual consumers, which is a concern given that tolerance has been found in studies of sleep and renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Curatolo-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curatolo 1983</LINK>). The amount of dietary caffeine required and the true benefit of dietary caffeine intake would be difficult to calculate due to the varying levels of caffeine within different foods and beverages. It appears that a substantial intake of caffeinated products would be needed to achieve a beneficial bronchodilatory effect and that possible undesirable side effects may outweigh the benefits.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-02 11:00:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>That caffeine has a bronchodilatory effect in asthma is clear from existing research. Future studies could address the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Patients' perception of the effect of caffeine on their asthma and quality of life, as this has not been systematically studied.</LI>
<LI>The maximum length of time at which bronchodilation is sustained, as this cannot be determined from existing trials.</LI>
<LI>Effects on patients with different levels of asthma severity, since existing trials have only studied people with mild to moderate asthma.</LI>
<LI>The response to caffeine of people with well-controlled asthmatics on anti-inflammatory agents. Asthmatics using inhaled steroids may be less responsive and this needs further evaluation.</LI>
<LI>Differences in the bronchodilator effects of caffeine between habitual consumers and non-consumers.</LI>
<LI>Whether caffeine ingestion alters management decisions in asthma (based on lung function measurements).</LI>
</OL>

<P>Reading the "Background" in the Abstract, it seems that the interest by caffeine as a bronchodilator is new. As a matter of fact, caffeine is used for asthma since, at least, the last decades of 1800. We can find reference to this drug in Marcel Proust's "A l'Ombre de Jeunes Filles en Fleur". This author, an asthmatic, refers that when he was very young (he was born in 1871) he used caffeine "that was prescribed for help me breathing".</P>
