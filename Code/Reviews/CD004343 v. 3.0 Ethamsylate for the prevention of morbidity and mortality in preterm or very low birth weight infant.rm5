<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prematurely born infants are at risk of bleeding into the brain in the first few weeks of life. This is called intraventricular haemorrhage. The risk of this occurring is greatest to infants who are born less than 32 weeks gestation. Many potential therapies have been studied to determine if they might reduce the risk of this bleeding. One such therapy is a drug called Ethamsylate. It is not exactly known how this drug works, but it appears to reduce bleeding in other clinical situations, such as excessive menstrual bleeding and after some types of surgery.</P>
<P>A total of seven studies with 1410 preterm infants were included in this review. Most of these initial studies were conducted between 1980 and 1990. Preterm infants treated with ethamsylate had similar outcomes with respect to death and disability at the age of two years when compared to infants who were treated with a placebo. Infants born less than 35 weeks gestation appeared to have less intraventricular haemorrhage when treated with ethamsylate compared to controls, however this did not lead to improved developmental outcome in later childhood. There were no adverse effects noted with ethamsylate treatment.</P>
<P>Based on these results, routine use of ethamsylate for prematurely born infants to prevent intraventricular haemorrhage cannot be recommended. It is highly unlikely that any further trials will be conducted to explore this clinical question.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for the prematurely born infant (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 2002</LINK>). The site of primary bleeding is the germinal matrix, which contains a fragile network of blood vessels lining the lateral ventricles. Four degrees of IVH have classically been identified by ultrasound examination. Grade 1 haemorrhage is bleeding into the germinal matrix with minimal intraventricular blood. Grade 2 haemorrhage is bleeding that breaks into the ventricle from the germinal matrix, but of a severity that does not cause ventricular dilatation. Grade 3 haemorrhage is intraventricular bleeding of germinal matrix origin which is severe enough to be classed as having caused posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. These effectively equate to Grades I, II and III IVH in the classification used by <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK> (a classification originally developed to describe the appearance of the brain on computed tomography, but later widely utilised to describe ultrasound findings in the period immediately after birth). They also closely parallel the grading system recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Volpe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 2002</LINK>. Longer-term outcomes from grade I/II IVH are now generally accepted to be relatively benign, with grade III/IV IVH and consequent post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation being more consistently associated with impaired neurodevelopment. However, advances in neuroimaging have brought with them increased understanding of other mechanisms of cerebral insult in the preterm infant, shifting current day focus away from IVH as the major precursor for neurodevelopmental impairment.</P>
<P>The interpretation of what <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK> originally termed grade IV IVH is more complex. It was initially thought to represent bleeding originating in the germinal matrix but extending into the parenchyma of the brain. However, it is now thought that the periventricular echo densities sometimes seen in the parenchyma of the brain soon after birth usually represent venous infarction rather than actual bleeding, and that such echo densities can occur even when there is no significant bleeding into the ventricles. Conversely, posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (grade III IVH) can occur with or without ultrasound features suggestive of parenchymal damage. These findings have very different prognostic implications. Most would now accept that the ischaemic changes associated with parenchymal damage cannot be described adequately using the classification used by Papile and may take some time to become detectable on ultrasound. Therefore, for the purpose of this review, the cases where there was evidence of altered parenchymal echogenicity or an increase in intraventricular volume will be considered together and labelled cases of grade III-IV IVH.</P>
<P>The limitations of ultrasound techniques available for assessing insults to the brain of perinatal origin in the 1980s need to be remembered when interpreting the outcomes of the trials done in that decade. Early ultrasound findings are mere surrogate measures for long-term morbidity, and often flawed measures at that. For this reason an assessment of functional outcome at least two years after birth is the only outcome of real consequence.</P>
<P>The exact aetiology of IVH in the human preterm infant remains uncertain. Animal studies using a beagle puppy model favour an ischaemia-reperfusion model for IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Goddard_x002d_Finegold-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goddard-Finegold 1982</LINK>). The uncertainty in humans has confounded the search for an effective preventive agent for IVH. Over the past thirty years a number of possible therapies have been evaluated.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ethamsylate (diethylammonium 1,4-dihydroxy-3-benzene sulfonate) has been evaluated as a possible treatment to prevent IVH. The recommended International Non-proprietary Name for this drug is etamsylate, but the older name has been used in this review because this was the name used by all those who studied it before 2000. This non-steroidal drug was shown to be effective in reducing blood loss from menorrhagia (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1976</LINK>) and following transurethral resection of the prostate (<LINK REF="REF-Symes-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symes 1975</LINK>). The benefits of ethamsylate in reducing bleeding in these settings led to the postulate that it may be of benefit in reducing IVH.</P>
<P>The precise mechanism of action of ethamsylate is unknown. Ethamsylate has been shown to reduce bleeding time and blood loss from wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Vinazzer-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinazzer 1980</LINK>). This appears to relate to increased platelet aggregation mediated by a thromboxane A2 or prostaglandin F2 alpha dependent mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Kowacs-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kowacs 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okuma-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuma 1982</LINK>). It has also been associated with decreased levels of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1alpha, a metabolite of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator (and may thus be implicated in reperfusion) and can disaggregate platelets (<LINK REF="STD-Rennie-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rennie 1986</LINK>). The prostaglandins may have a role in regulating cerebral blood flow, however, ethamsylate appears to have no effect on cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1989</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-02 17:11:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential benefits of ethamsylate include those associated with reduction in bleeding tendency, such as reduction in IVH and those associated with prostaglandin inhibition such as closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosti 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The only adverse event reported in relation to the use of ethamsylate is transient hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Langdon-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langdon 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1977</LINK>). Ethamsylate appears to have no anticyclooxygenase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1994</LINK>) and, therefore, is not associated with the same side effect profile as other inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis.</P>

These studies were <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK> (European Community Trial Group) with neurodevelopmental follow-up reported in <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Amato-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1993</LINK> which was also published as <LINK REF="REF-Amato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sanghvi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanghvi 1999</LINK>.

<LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1981</LINK> recruited patients from Liverpool, UK and studied 73 infants with birth weight &lt; 1500 g and excluded infants with lethal congenital malformation. Three infants were not considered in the analysis because they were found to have IVH before randomisation. Thirty-five infants were randomised to ethamsylate and the remaining 35 received placebo. Subjects received 0.1 ml/kg of either ethamsylate (equal to 12.5 mg/kg) or placebo as an intramuscular injection within two hours of birth and then six-hourly for four days. They reported short-term outcomes, specifically IVH, only. Cranial ultrasounds were performed prior to study entry and then daily for the first week of life. A description of the scanner used and limited description of the views recorded was provided, however, there are no data regarding the inter- or intra-observer reliability of the operators performing the scanning. Audit of the quality of scans was not undertaken as they were being carried out by the clinicians responsible for the patients. IVH was classified according to <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>. Incidence and cause of neonatal death were also reported. Limited longer-term follow-up data were obtained directly from the authors.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Benson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1986</LINK> recruited patients from South Wales and the West of England and studied 366 infants with birth weight &#8804; 1500 g. Four of these infants with lethal congenital malformations were excluded. Two further infants were withdrawn from the study for logistic reasons (parental refusal and transfer to non-participating centre). Of the remaining 360 infants, 183 were randomised to receive ethamsylate and 177 placebo. Infants received 0.1ml/kg of either ethamsylate (12.5 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline) within an hour of birth either i.v. or i.m., followed by six-hourly doses i.v. for four days. Only infants for whom there was no evidence of IVH on initial ultrasound scan were included in the analysis of incidence and severity of IVH. Data for 30 infants were, therefore, not reported for this outcome. We have dealt with this by subgroup analysis. Cranial ultrasound was performed soon after birth, and then on days three, seven and fourteen. There are no data to support the premise that cranial ultrasounds were standardised. IVH diagnosed by cranial ultrasound was classified using a modification of <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>. Specifically, grade 1 referred to subependymal haemorrhage, grade 2 referred to intraventricular haemorrhage and grade 3 referred to parenchymal haemorrhage. This made it impossible to distinguish grades 2 and 3 under the classification of <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>. Cause of neonatal death was reported, as were complications during the first 14 days of life - including hypotension and PDA, although it is not clear whether all PDA reported as a complication was treated with either indomethacin or surgical ligation. It is assumed for the purpose of the systematic review that those infants listed as having PDA were treated either medically or surgically.<BR/>
<BR/>The long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up for these infants is reported by <LINK REF="REF-Schulte-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte 2005</LINK>. Subjects were seen between 3.5 and 4.2 years of age and assessed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, a full physical examination including vision test and audiology and a standardised neurological examination.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK> involved collaborators from France, Greece and the United Kingdom. Collectively, they studied 334 infants who were deemed to be eligible based on gestational age of less than 33 weeks. For these infants, eligibility was further qualified by the statement that the treating physician had to be in a state of equipoise regarding the use of ethamsylate for such an infant. One hundred and sixty-five infants were randomised to receive ethamsylate and the remaining 169 were randomised to be controls. Sixty-nine per cent of treatment group infants and 70% of controls had a birth weight &lt; 1500 g. Treatment subjects received 12.5 mg/kg ethamsylate either i.v. or i.m. within four hours of birth, followed by 15 further doses i.v. every six hours for four days. Control infants received nothing other than standard care. The authors report that one control infant received ethamsylate (number of doses unknown) and 82% of treated subjects received the full course of ethamsylate, with death being the major reason for non-completion of the treatment course. Subjects had a minimum of two cranial ultrasounds but the timing of these varied depending on the study centre and the way in which they were performed was not standardised. Reporting of cranial ultrasounds was by a modified <LINK REF="REF-Levene-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1981</LINK> classification. Their definition of a major cerebral problem as "any lesion affecting the brain parenchyma, and/or hydrocephalus, and/or intraventricular haemorrhage complicated by ventricular dilatation" allows capture of severe IVH (grade 3 or 4). However, into this group there may also be included cases of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) detectable at a three week cranial ultrasound scan, and PVL may develop independent of any grade of IVH. The major outcomes from this initial study were death, disability at three months of age and use of health resources.<BR/>
<BR/>The long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up for these infants is reported by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2001</LINK>. Subjects were seen at approximately two years of age. Neuromotor impairment was determined by an examining paediatrician and developmental delay was defined as mild (less than six months behind), moderate (6 to 12 months behind) or severe (&gt; 12 months behind). Different approaches are known to have been used to assess developmental delay in the participating units, but because the randomisation process ensured a balance between active and control patients in each centre, this will have had little effect on the trial's ability to detect a difference in the number of children with developmental delay in the two trial groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1993</LINK> recruited patients from Berne, Switzerland and enrolled 20 preterm infants with severe RDS whose birth weight was between 700 g and 2000 g. Infants were excluded if there had been prolonged rupture of the membranes for greater than three weeks, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage on serial ultrasound scanning within 15 hours of birth, evidence of perinatal asphyxia (Apgar score &lt; 4 at one minute of life or &lt; 6 at five minutes of life) or major congenital anomalies. Ten infants were randomised to each group. The treatment group received their first dose of ethamsylate (12.5 mg/kg) intravenously within four hours of birth and thereafter received six-hourly doses for four days. The placebo group received 0.1 ml/kg normal saline at the same dosing interval. The primary outcome of this study was development of symptomatic PDA based on clinical criteria (increased heart rate &gt; 150 beats per minute, characteristic murmur, hyperdynamic precordium with collapsing pulses) with supportive echocardiographic findings (increase in left atrium/aortic root dimension ratio &gt; 1.30). It is assumed for the purpose of this review that those infants with PDA defined by these criteria were treated for such either medically or surgically. PIVH (grades 1/2 and 3/4) and mortality to hospital discharge were also reported. Frequency of cranial ultrasonography was not reported. Grade 3 or 4 IVH determined by serial ultrasound scan is cited as an exclusion criteria and then reported as an outcome. This trial was also reported in <LINK REF="REF-Amato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1992</LINK> (no mention of this publication was made in the subsequent paper). No long-term follow-up was reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1988</LINK> recruited babies from Ankara, Turkey and studied 246 infants whose gestational age was &lt; 34 weeks (excluding infants with lethal congenital malformations). The authors report that eligible infants were consecutively assigned a trial number and allocated to treatment with ethamsylate or no treatment. Exactly how they were allocated is not stated and 146 infants received ethamsylate while only 100 received no treatment, suggesting that sequential allocation was not employed. Ethamsylate was given unblinded according to a regimen similar to that employed by all other trials (12.5 mg/kg i.v. within an hour of birth followed by six-hourly doses over four days to maximum dose of 200 mg/kg). The only outcome reported was neonatal mortality, and mortality before seven days of age. Cranial ultrasonography was not available and so PIVH is not reported. No long-term follow-up was reported. Given the uncertain nature of randomisation, we conducted meta-analyses both including and excluding this trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1993</LINK> recruited babies from Taichung, Taiwan and enrolled 171 infants with birth weights &lt; 1751 g into their randomised controlled trial. Babies with PIVH on initial ultrasound (performed within an hour of delivery) were excluded. Eighty-six infants were treated with ethamsylate, beginning within one hour of birth (same regimen as other studies) and control infants received 0.1 ml/kg normal saline i.v. at the same dosing interval. The primary outcome was detection of PIVH. Cranial ultrasonography was performed on days one, two, three, five, seven and fourteen and PIVH was classified according to the grading system of <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>. No long-term follow-up was reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sanghvi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanghvi 1999</LINK> recruited babies from Mumbai, India and enrolled 200 infants born &lt; 34 weeks gestation. They excluded infants with congenital malformations (eight), family history of bleeding disorders and Apgar score &lt; 5 at five minutes. Eight infants died after randomisation (five due to sepsis and three due to respiratory distress), however, their allocated group was not stated and they were excluded from further analysis. Short term outcomes were reported on 192 infants. Treatment subjects received ethamsylate 12.5 mg/kg i.v. within one hour of birth and thereafter six hourly for four days. Control subjects received only routine medication. The primary outcome was PIVH and cranial ultrasonography was performed on days three to five, 10 to 14, 28 to 30 and then pre-discharge. Classification of PIVH was according to the grading system of <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>. The authors reported that none of the infants exhibited any side effects of ethamsylate. They did report that hypotension requiring inotropic support was seen in six infants in the treatment group but that this was not attributed to ethamsylate; the timing of the hypotension or the presumed cause were not stated. No long-term follow-up was reported.</P>
<P>Two papers identified by the initial search strategy were not really eligible for inclusion. The findings reported by <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 1984</LINK> were not used because this report included outcome information on non-randomised as well as randomised children. This paper outlined two-year outcomes for babies in the <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1981</LINK> trial but the data could not be used because it had been combined with data from other non-randomised children. Similarly, the findings reported by <LINK REF="STD-Rennie-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rennie 1986</LINK> simply gave the 6-ketoPGF1 alpha levels seen in some of the children in the <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1986</LINK> trial (see table 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies').</P>
<P>The study report for one study <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1997</LINK> was not locatable. We intend to include this data if the report can be located.</P>

<P>The cranial ultrasonographer was blinded to which arm of the trial the baby had been allocated. In <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1986</LINK>, the cranial ultrasonographer was blinded to study arm by virtue that randomisation was generated by the manufacturer and ethamsylate and placebo were identical in appearance. In <LINK REF="REF-Schulte-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte 2005</LINK>, a single assessor performed all the long-term follow-up and was blind to the treatment arm of the subject. For the <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK>, early cranial ultrasound assessments were undertaken by staff who were unaware which arm of the trial the subject was in. Assessment at two years was reported as having been done blind to trial allocation by staff in the four French centres and the same was  also 'usually' true in the six Greek centres.

<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1981</LINK> were able to provide information beyond that which was published (with thanks to Richard Cooke). Of the 35 children treated with ethamsylate, 11 died by the age of three years; 2 of 24 survivors had spastic diplegia with cognitive delay and two others had significant cognitive delay without cerebral palsy. In the control group, seven died by the age of three years; 3 of 28 had developed cerebral palsy with some cognitive delay, one child with severe fetal growth retardation was dysmorphic with severe developmental delay and one child had trisomy 21.<BR/>

Outcome at 3.5 to 4.2 years was known for all of the 137/183 surviving subjects in the treatment arm, and all 139/177 surviving control infants in their trial. Sixteen children developed cerebral palsy, nine had cognitive delay (general cognitive index &lt; 70), three were registered blind and four had sensorineural hearing loss requiring aids. There was overlap between these categories such that 18 children in total had major impairment at the time of assessment. In the control arm, 14 children had cerebral palsy, 19 had cognitive delay (with general cognitive index &lt; 70), one was blind and two were deaf - 22 control children in total were considered to have major impairment.<BR/>
<BR/>From the <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK> study, after assessment at two years, information was available for 101 of 129 possible survivors in the treatment arm (28 out of 165 were lost to follow up; 83% retained), and 103 of a possible 134 control infants (31 out of 169 were lost to follow up; 82% retained). They reported figures for "any impairment or disability" in survivors assessed at two years and this is reported in our meta-analysis.<BR/>There was no long-term follow-up information available from any of the other trials.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:56:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ethamsylate has been studied in a number of randomised controlled trials to determine its role in neuroprotection for the preterm infant. Based on its mechanism of action and perceived benefit in other bleeding disorders (e.g. menorrhagia) it was postulated that ethamsylate may lead to a reduction in IVH. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that ethamsylate does indeed lead to a reduction in the incidence of any grade of IVH by 37% in infants &lt; 31 weeks gestation or &lt; 1500 grams (typical RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86), by 22% in infants &lt; 32 weeks gestation or &lt; 1750 grams (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) and by 23% in infants &lt; 35 weeks gestation or &lt; 2000 grams (typical RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.92). When high grade IVH is considered, there is a trend to reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 IVH at &lt; 31 and &lt; 32 weeks gestation, and a statistically significant reduction of 33% in grade 3/4 IVH in infants &lt; 35 weeks gestation (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94).</P>
<P>However, there are a number of problems with this finding. The first relates to the definitions of IVH used by the different studies. <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1986</LINK> used a modification of the classification first described by <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>, simply separating intraventricular from parenchymal haemorrhage, and making it impossible to differentiate grade 2 IVH (without ventricular dilatation) from haemorrhage associated with ventricular dilatation. <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1981</LINK> on the other hand used the grading system defined by <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK> used a different system again, recording information about IVH, ventricular dilatation and cystic white matter injury.<BR/>
<BR/>Availability and timing of ultrasound scans were also highly variable between studies making it very difficult to interpret results pertaining to the presence of IVH prior to trial entry (the <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK> did not perform scans early enough to allow detection of pre-existing haemorrhage).<BR/>
<BR/>The primary studies reviewed here were performed as early as the late 1970s and as late as the early 1990s. These studies were, therefore, performed at times when standard perinatal practice would have varied widely. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1988</LINK>, routine cranial ultrasound was not available in clinical practice. This clearly has implications for the detection and management of IVH. Our finding of a significant reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 IVH among infants born less than 35 weeks gestation is of little relevance when, in the scope of current practice, IVH is a rare event in infants &gt; 30 weeks gestation, and routine screening ultrasound beyond 30 weeks is no longer recommended <LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>The strength of this review comes from the high quality of the long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up studies that relate to the larger randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EC-Trial-Group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">EC Trial Group 1994</LINK>). The investigators in these studies must be congratulated for persevering not only in obtaining the information from a high percentage of their cohort, but also for publishing this data despite the lapse of several years. Most notably, the use of ethamsylate at any gestation does not appear to confer any benefit on mortality (either neonatal or to hospital discharge) or on any component of neurodevelopment, including cognition, neuromotor performance (measured by evidence of cerebral palsy) or major sensory impairment. Any effect that ethamsylate may be observed to have on IVH is, therefore, really secondary and largely irrelevant if such effects do not translate into improvement in clinically meaningful longer-term outcomes. This finding is not unique. The systematic review of prophylactic indomethacin in preterm infants by Fowlie and Davis found a significant reduction in grade 3/4 IVH that was not coupled with any long-term neurodevelopmental benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also of interest that we found a significant reduction in the incidence of symptomatic PDA (68%, typical RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.87) among infants &lt; 31 weeks gestation treated with ethamsylate. The potential role of the patent ductus on cerebral haemodynamics and subsequent cerebral injury makes this another interesting finding.However, without concomitant reduction in mortality or neurodevelopmental impairment it is of little consequence.</P>
<P>Our understanding of perinatal brain injury in preterm infants is evolving. With advances in neuroimaging and improved understanding of the pathogenesis of IVH and posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, it is becoming increasingly apparent that IVH on its own is not the sole substrate of cerebral injury and subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment. Cranial ultrasound does not perform well in the detection of non-cystic white matter injury. The role of environment on influencing cerebral plasticity and mediating long-term outcome is still poorly understood. Despite the appeal of measuring IVH with cranial ultrasound as a short term outcome of clinical studies, it must be realised that clinical research must focus on clinically meaningful longer-term outcomes, and this will require funding bodies to appreciate the need for longer-term interest.</P>
<P>The only adverse side-effect of ethamsylate noted in previous clinical studies has been hypotension, and we could find no significant difference in the rate of hypotension between those infants treated with ethamsylate and those treated with placebo. Therefore, it would seem from this systematic review that, if nothing else, ethamsylate is safe when given to premature infants.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of ethamsylate in preterm infants as a therapy for improving mortality or neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:23:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ethamsylate was both studied and used clinically as recently as the mid-1990s. The randomised controlled trials investigating the use of ethamsylate have enrolled over 700 infants and have failed to find any clinically meaningful benefit in terms of mortality or neurodevelopmental outcome. Further studies of ethamsylate in the clinical setting of prematurity would be difficult to justify based on the results of this systematic review.</P>
