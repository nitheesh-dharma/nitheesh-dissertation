<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:24:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures of the thigh bone (femur) near the hip joint (termed intracapsular) may be treated by fixing the fracture (with screws or pins), or alternatively replacing the top of the femur at the hip joint (femoral head) with an artificial hip joint (arthroplasty).</P>
<P>Nineteen trials, of which two were newly included in this update, involving 3044 participants, were included in this review. Some trials had weak methods, which required a more cautious interpretation of their results. There were many different types of devices and methods used to place these devices for both treatments in the included trials.</P>
<P>We found that each treatment has its own specific complications. Realigning the bones and fixing the fracture (reduction and internal fixation) is a shorter operation with less blood loss. However, people having internal fixation are more likely to need another operation than those treated with joint replacement (40% versus 11%). The reason for this is mainly from a failure of the bone to heal in those cases treated with fixation. No definite differences were found between the two treatment groups in the numbers of patients who had died by various follow-up times. People who had a replacement with an artificial hip joint that was fixed in place with cement seemed to have less residual pain and better function related to using the hip than those whose fracture was fixed. There is not enough evidence to be sure whether fixation of the bone or replacement with an artificial hip is best for treating fractures of the thigh bone near the hip joint.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen trials, of which two were newly included in this update, involving 3044 participants, were included. There was considerable variation in the types of implants and techniques used for both internal fixation and arthroplasty in the included trials. The risk of selection bias was low in just three trials, unclear in 13 trials and high in the three quasi-randomised trials. Just three trials reported assessor blinding of functional outcomes.</P>
<P>Length of surgery, operative blood loss, need for blood transfusion and risk of deep wound infection were significantly less for internal fixation compared with arthroplasty. Fixation had a significantly higher re-operation rate in comparison with arthroplasty (40% versus 11%; risk ratio 3.22, 95% CI 2.31 to 4.47, 19 trials). No definite differences for hospital stay, mortality, or regain of pre-injury residential state were found. Limited information from some studies suggested pain was less and function was better for a cemented arthroplasty in comparison with fixation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip. Definite conclusions cannot be made for differences in pain and residual disability between the two groups. Future studies should concentrate on better reporting of final outcome measures and function. There is still a need for studies to define which patient groups are better served by the different treatment methods.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:28:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Proximal femoral fractures or, as they are more generally termed, 'hip fractures', can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring distal to the hip joint capsule). Intracapsular fractures can be further subdivided into those which are displaced and those which are essentially undisplaced. Undisplaced fractures include those termed impacted, valgus or abduction fractures. Many other subdivisions and classification methods exist for intracapsular fractures but are of questionable clinical value.</P>
<P>A displaced intracapsular hip fracture if left untreated invariably leads to non-union of the fracture, which results in a painful hip and inability to weight bear on that limb. Thus this type of fracture is almost always managed surgically, either by fixing the fracture using various implants and thereby retaining the femoral head, or by replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis. The displaced intracapsular fracture has frequently been termed 'the unsolved fracture', as debate continues as to whether the femoral head should be preserved by reducing and fixing the fracture or be replaced by an arthroplasty.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-12 08:59:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Internal fixation entails first reducing the fracture, generally under X-ray control using an image intensifier. The reduced position is then held by either single or multiple screws or pins, passed across the fracture under X-ray guidance. Numerous implants are available for fixation of the fracture, and randomised trials comparing different implants are reported in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>; last update Issue 2, 2011).</P>
<P>Arthroplasty for an intracapsular fracture entails replacing the femoral head, which has fractured from the femur with an artificial hip joint. The type of arthroplasty may be either a hemiarthroplasty (partial hip replacement) or a total hip replacement (THR). Hemiarthroplasty involves replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis whilst retaining the natural acetabulum and acetabular cartilage. The type of hemiarthroplasty can be broadly divided into two groups: unipolar and bipolar. The unipolar hemiarthroplasty is a solid prosthesis whilst the bipolar prosthesis is designed to allow movement to occur, not only between the acetabulum and the prosthesis, but also at a joint within the prosthesis itself. Total hip replacement involves the replacement of the acetabulum in addition to the femoral head. The acetabular component is usually made of a high-density polyethylene and is often cemented into place. The metal femoral stems used for an arthroplasty may be either held in place with cement or inserted as a 'press fit', without cement. Randomised trials comparing different the different types of arthroplasties for hip fracture are reported in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-09-12 20:28:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The main complication of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation is the failure of the fracture to heal. This may lead to fracture displacement and this is termed 'early fracture displacement' or 'non-union' if it occurs in the first few weeks from operation. The term 'non-union' is also used for those fractures that fail to heal in later weeks. This generally leads to the fracture displacing with loss of position of the fixation device. An incidence of non-union of 20% to 35% for displaced intracapsular fractures can be expected (<LINK REF="REF-Lu_x002d_Yao-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu-Yao 1994</LINK>). Another major complication after internal fixation is avascular necrosis (also termed segmental collapse or femoral head necrosis). This is seen as the collapse of the femoral head and subsequent destruction of the hip joint. It occurs secondary to disruption of the blood supply to the femoral head. An incidence of 5% to 30% can be expected. Other fracture healing complications that may occur after internal fixation are backing out of the implant as the fracture heals, fracture below or around the implant and breakage of the implant.</P>
<P>Potential complications of arthroplasty include wound sepsis and infection around the implant, dislocation of the prosthesis, loosening of the prosthesis stem, loosening of the acetabular component (total hip replacement only), acetabular wear (hemiarthroplasty only), breakage of the implant, disassembly of the implant, fracture below or around the implant and adverse reactions to the use of cement.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-26 14:58:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Conducted prior to the publication of the first version of this review in 2003, a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lu_x002d_Yao-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu-Yao 1994</LINK>) of 106 randomised trials and comparative series concluded that mortality was similar between internal fixation and arthroplasty but that re-operation was three times more common after internal fixation. Deep infection was more common after arthroplasty. Pain was less within the first two years after arthroplasty but there was no difference in mobility between the two types of treatment. A later systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2003</LINK>) concluded that arthroplasty reduces the risk of revision surgery at a cost of increased infection rates, increased blood loss and operative times and a possible increase in early mortality rates. The previous update of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006</LINK>) drew similar conclusions, but also noted there remained insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions for pain and function. Additionally, there is continuing variation in practice in the choice of internal fixation or arthroplasty for displaced intracapsular hip fractures. Hence, an update of the review starting with an updated search for randomised trials was warranted.</P>

<P>The risk of bias assessments for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding for individual trials are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and an overall summary is given in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. The majority of judgements for sequence generation and allocation concealment were 'unclear', which reflected in part the poor reporting of the methods of randomisation in these trials. Only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Frihagen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Frihagen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogmark-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rogmark 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STARS 2006</LINK>) were judged at low risk for selection bias reflecting adequate allocation concealment. The three quasi-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mouzopoulos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mouzopoulos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soreide-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Soreide 1979</LINK>) were considered at high risk of bias resulting from both inadequate sequence generation and lack of allocation concealment. Further details of the randomisation methods reported in the 19 trials are given below. Just three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frihagen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Frihagen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouzopoulos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mouzopoulos 2008</LINK>) were considered at low risk of assessor blinding for functional outcome assessment.</P>

The assessment of the different studies is detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. In general the older trials have inferior trial methodology compared with the more recently designed trials, although this may in part be due to better trial reporting and there are exceptions.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-09-12 21:11:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where available the results have been presented in the analyses. As previously noted, and reflecting current practice, the included trials used a wide selection of implants for both fixation and replacement arthroplasty, making direct comparisons between trials difficult. As the 19 included studies employed a large variety of implants it was not possible to present the results in a simple format. Analyses 1.1 to 1.45 test our primary hypothesis by pooling data to compare a policy of internal fixation with a policy of arthroplasty. These analyses contain subgroups for internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty, internal fixation versus total hip arthroplasty, and internal fixation versus any hip arthroplasty. These results need to be viewed with caution because of the range of implants used and the heterogeneity of study participants. Analyses 2.1 to 2.18 present pooled data for internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty, with subgroup analysis of different individual comparisons. Analyses 3.1 to 3.15 present pooled data for internal fixation versus total hip arthroplasty, with subgroup analysis of different individual comparisons. The results for <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STARS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STARS 2006</LINK>, each of which had three treatment groups, are presented separately in the analyses for hemiarthroplasty (Analysis 2) and total hip replacement (Analysis 3). This does not apply for <LINK REF="STD-Rogmark-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rogmark 2002</LINK> because the different types of arthroplasty were all in one treatment group of this trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Operative details</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of surgery</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen trials recorded this outcome and all reported a significantly shorter operative time for fixation. Seven trials gave the means with standard deviations and are shown in the analyses (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The data for all three analyses have not been pooled given the clearly visible and highly significant heterogeneity reflecting large variations in the length of operations. This is consistent with the large variety of surgical methods employed in these seven trials and may also reflect different definitions of this outcome. The reported times may not include the time needed for reduction of the fracture for internal fixation and relate only to the duration of the surgical procedure.</P>
<P>Results from the other five studies were as follows: <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1984</LINK> reported mean times of 67 minutes for fixation with four AO screws versus 91 minutes with uncemented Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty. The time for internal fixation did not include the reduction time. <LINK REF="STD-van-Vugt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van Vugt 1993</LINK> reported mean times of 66 minutes for fixation with a dynamic hip screw versus 80 minutes for a Stanmore bipolar hemiarthroplasty. <LINK REF="STD-Soreide-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Soreide 1979</LINK> reported mean times of 38 minutes for fixation with von Bahr screws versus 86 minutes for Christiansen bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The time for internal fixation did not include the reduction time. <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1985</LINK> reported mean times of 42 minutes for fixation with a compression screw versus 39 minutes for fixation with a McLaughlin nail plate versus 79 minutes for a Christiansen bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Lastly, <LINK REF="STD-Rogmark-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rogmark 2002</LINK> reported mean times of 27 minutes for fixation with Hansson hook-pins or Olmed screws versus 80 minutes for various arthroplasties.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Operative blood loss</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies reported on operative blood loss and all favoured fixation. Seven gave the means with standard deviations and are therefore presented in the analyses (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). The data for these analyses have not been pooled given the highly significant heterogeneity. As shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, fixation was associated with a lower operative blood loss, with mean differences ranging between 149 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2002</LINK>) and 550 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Tidermark-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tidermark 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-van-Vugt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van Vugt 1993</LINK> reported perioperative blood loss for all the 21 patients in the dynamic hip screw group as less than 500 ml (median 200 ml). For the 22 patients in the Stanmore bipolar group, 18 had a blood loss of less than 500 ml, three had a blood loss of 500 ml to 1000 ml and one had a blood loss greater than 1000 ml (median 400 ml).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Post-operative blood transfusion</HEADING>
<P>Six studies reported the number of patients transfused following fixation compared with arthroplasty (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Transfusion was required less frequently in the internal fixation group, with the exception of the <LINK REF="STD-STARS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STARS 2006</LINK> trial. Mean units of blood transfused reported in two studies was reduced for the fixation group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1985</LINK> found lower mean units of blood transfused in the two fixation groups (0.3 units for the compression screw and McLaughlin nail plate groups) compared with 1.4 units for the Christiansen bipolar hemiarthroplasty group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complications related to type of operation</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-union of fracture following internal fixation</HEADING>
<P>This included, what is also termed in some reports, early displacement, redisplacement, early dislocation of the fracture and pseudarthrosis.

<P>Results from the trials that reported the number of patients with dislocation are summarised in <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>, with results presented separately for hemiarthroplasty and total hip replacement (THR). For hemiarthroplasty, there were 35/887 (3.9%) patients with dislocations and for THR, 44/333 (13.2%). A number of patients with dislocations had recurrent dislocations, particularly for those with THR. However, reporting of recurrent dislocations was variable. <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK> stated that five of the 18 patients with a dislocated THR had recurrent dislocations. <LINK REF="STD-Rogmark-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rogmark 2002</LINK> reported 15 patients with dislocations, of which seven had recurrent dislocations and six of the 12 patients with dislocation in <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2002</LINK> were recurrent. <LINK REF="STD-Tidermark-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tidermark 2003</LINK> had only one case of dislocation which was recurrent and required revision.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fracture below or around the implant</HEADING>
<P>This outcome occurs after both internal fixation and arthroplasty but was only reported in five studies. The incidence was 8/576 (1.4%) after internal fixation and 18/552 (3.3%) after arthroplasty (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only five trials gave the number of patients with residual pain at one year (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>). These studies showed significant heterogeneity. Pooling of data showed a tendency to less pain with fixation for the two studies which compared an internal fixation with uncemented hemiarthroplasty (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.05). For the two studies that compared internal fixation against a cemented THR, the results tended to favour arthroplasty (RR 3.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 10.56). Drawing on our findings of a trend to lower pain after cemented arthroplasty when compared with an uncemented arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>), we note that the two studies in the hemiarthroplasty group (<LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2002</LINK>) used an uncemented arthroplasty.

<P>Further examination of pain outcomes taking into account of whether the arthroplasty was cemented or uncemented generally adds support to this finding.</P>
<P>Additional results from the studies that involved an uncemented arthroplasty were from <LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2005</LINK> also reported that pain scores were reduced for arthroplasty at four months but by the one- and two-year assessments there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2002</LINK> also reported no statistically significant difference between groups in mean pain scores (2.40 versus 2.22, P = 0.91). <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK> reported that, at one year, 12% of those treated by internal fixation had significant residual pain as opposed to 27% treated by uncemented hemiarthroplasty, whilst none of those treated by cemented THR complained of residual pain.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-12 21:12:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some caution is needed when considering the results of this review because of the wide range of implants used both for fixation and replacement arthroplasty. It is likely that this variety of usage will continue in clinical practice. Recently published updates of Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK> - updated in 2011) have found insufficient evidence to recommend one implant over another, for either procedure. There was, however, some evidence to suggest that a cemented prosthetic replacement was associated with less risk of failure to regain mobility and less post-operative pain than an uncemented prosthesis. More research was recommended. This may have implications for this review as those studies that used an uncemented implant may be less relevant (<LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding operative details, it is clear that, compared with replacement arthroplasty, internal fixation is associated with a shorter length of surgery, and lower operative blood loss and need for transfusion.</P>
<P>The orthopaedic complications and resultant surgery following reduction and fixation are different to those after replacement arthroplasty. This makes it difficult to decide which treatment has a greater implication in terms of re-operations, for the patient, surgeon and hospital resources. In addition some re-operations are of a greater consequence than others. We subdivided re-operations into three categories: minor, moderate and major. We accept that this division is somewhat arbitrary, but consider it is important to differentiate between a more minor surgical procedure, such as removal of an internal fixation implant which is a short operation, sometimes done as a day case procedure and under local anaesthesia, and the more extensive operations such as a revision arthroplasty.</P>
<P>The analyses only document the number of patients requiring secondary operations in each category. A number of these patients would have more than one secondary operation. This may occur in patients who had a removal of an internal fixation device and an arthroplasty at a later date. In addition dislocation of an arthroplasty may have occurred more than once in some patients, particularly for those with a THR. The number of times that recurrent dislocation occurred was often not reported. This meant that we were not able to present results for the total number of re-operations for the different treatment methods. Also, the re-operation rates given in the tables are only for those re-operations that occurred within the follow-up period and as documented in the individual studies. The number and nature of later surgical procedures in some studies were poorly documented. As the follow-up period of most of the studies was one to three years the overall re-operation rate is lower than would occur in clinical practice. This may be particularly relevant for the long-term revision rate of the arthroplasties, which was not well documented.</P>
<P>The analyses for the outcome of re-operation indicate that internal fixation is associated with an increased risk of re-operation when compared with arthroplasty (40% versus 11%). Most re-operations after internal fixation were accounted for by the occurrence of fracture non-union and avascular necrosis, with surgical treatment of this by insertion of an arthroplasty. 'Major' re-operations which were all either revision arthroplasty or surgical treatment of a fracture around an implant were more common after arthroplasty.</P>
<P>As would be expected for a more extensive surgical operation, arthroplasty was associated with an increased risk of deep wound infection around the implant.</P>
<P>For the postoperative complications of pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, stroke (cerebrovascular accident) and pressure sores there was no difference in incidence between treatment methods. While there was a tendency for a lower total complication rate after internal fixation, this outcome was not present for all studies and it would be inappropriate to make definite conclusions from this.</P>
<P>Although pooling of data was generally not possible for the outcome of hospital stay, there appeared to be no major differences in hospital stay between treatment methods.</P>
<P>There was very poor reporting of the outcome measures of shortening of the limb, rotational deformity or loss of movement of the affected hip. Further studies are required to report on this outcome before any definite conclusions may be made. In particular, it may be useful to explore the correlation between anatomical and functional outcomes, to assess how much the loss of a certain degree of range of movement is clinically important from a functional point of view.</P>
<P>Pooling of data for mortality showed there was essentially no difference between fixation and arthroplasty. There was however a trend to a lower early mortality for those treated by internal fixation in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Frihagen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Frihagen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2002</LINK>. It is unfortunate that the data for the study of <LINK REF="STD-Davison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 2001</LINK> cannot be included in the analysis as this study reported without usable data, a reduced mortality after internal fixation. All studies indicated that any differences in mortality that were found early were no longer present at one year and thereafter. The majority of studies did not undertake an intention-to-treat analysis. This may bias the outcome of mortality in favour of arthroplasty. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Rogmark-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rogmark 2002</LINK>, states that 10 patients were excluded after randomisation (generally to the arthroplasty group) as they were considered unfit for arthroplasty. The outcomes for these patients should have been included within the group to which they were randomised, but were in fact excluded from the analysis. This means that potentially sicker patients were removed from the arthroplasty group.</P>
<P>The important final outcome measure of pain was poorly reported or not even mentioned in many studies. This makes the formation of definite conclusions on the degree of pain experienced from the two procedures impossible. There was some indication, consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>, that pain was less after a cemented arthroplasty but not an uncemented arthroplasty. Again this would need confirmation.</P>
<P>The outcomes of failure to regain mobility and failure to return to former residential status were poorly reported and it was not possible to determine if any notable differences existed between the treatment methods.</P>
<P>Composite scores were used by many of the studies in assessing outcome. A number of different outcomes were used to make up these scores and included pain, movement and function ability. The variety of scores used and variable reporting of results means that such scores have limited value in summarising results within a systematic review. The results as presented suggest similar scores were achieved for the comparisons of fixation with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty, but for those studies comparing fixation with THR results, scores appeared to be better after arthroplasty.</P>
<P>In this review, the age range of included participants is wide notwithstanding that several trials set lower age limits (between 60 and 75 years). Some studies have only looked at patients able to pass a cognitive assessment, while others have included those with cognitive impairment including two studies that only included these patients. These factors (age and mental function) alone, in clinical practice, often influence choice of surgery. Even if there was an easy way to group trials by age of participants, this would be somewhat of an arbitrary decision and potentially subject to biases. For the 'younger' patients (age range 50 to 70), the long term outcomes of residual pain and revision are more relevant, whilst for the older patients (age over 70 years), the outcome of mortality may be more relevant. Because of the limited studies to date with their varying entry requirements and different treatment methods at present we have not been able to analyse the studies grouped for age of mental status.</P>

These both reported the increased re-operation rate associated with internal fixation and the absence of major differences in functional outcomes and mortality between treatment methods. </P>

<P>Both internal fixation and arthroplasty have their own inherent surgical complications. Internal fixation is associated with less surgical trauma for the primary operation but fracture healing complications and secondary surgical operations are more prevalent. There appears to be no difference in the mortality at one year or more between procedures. For the survivors, pain and function appear to be better after a cemented arthroplasty.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-12 18:18:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-conducted randomised controlled trials are required on this topic. Such trials should use implants and surgical techniques that reflect current practice and the best evidence available. They should have appropriate methodology with full reporting of final outcome measures and an adequate length of follow-up. Studies should also be undertaken to see which particular groups of patients would be better treated by either internal fixation or arthroplasty. These groups may be the frail elderly, those with specific medical conditions that may affect recovery or fracture healing, or the 'younger' patient with a longer life expectancy.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study involved 34 patients, aged over 50 years, who were allocated to fixation with Knowles or Neufeld pins or replacement with a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty (type not specified). Follow-up of patients averaged 19 months. Minimal data reported. Patients receiving hemiarthroplasties had statistically significantly longer anaesthetic and surgery time and greater blood loss. For length of hospital stay, average pain grade and average mobility grade there was no statistical difference between the two groups.<BR/>The trial was excluded due to inadequate randomisation. Patients were allocated according to day of week and surgeon preference. Surgeon A elected on all even nights to use internal fixation, surgeon B on all odd nights to use hemiarthroplasty. In addition to the low numbers recruited five were lost to follow-up.</P>

<P>This paper was described in the text as a &#8216;randomized trial of surgical treatment&#8217;. Of the 45 included patients, 10 patients were subsequently excluded because of loss to follow-up. For the remaining 35 patients, 5 were treated with internal fixation with Smith-Peterson nailing, 10 by internal fixation with Garden screws, 7 with a Thompson hemiarthroplasty and 13 with an Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty. There was limited description of patient characteristics, treatment methods and trial methodology. The only outcomes reported clearly were wound sepsis requiring antibiotics for two patients in the fixation group and five in the arthroplasty group. Nine cases of failure of surgical treatment were reported in the fixation group but it was unclear what constituted failure of treatment. Five wound haematomas and transient sciatic nerve paralysis were reported in the arthroplasty group. Re-operations were not reported. Regain of mobility was reported at one year but the numbers were unclear. The study was excluded because of the inadequate trial methodology and reporting of the results.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a randomised study of 218 patients. Patients were allocated to three arms - fixation with Garden screws, a cemented Thompson using an anterior approach or to a cemented Thompson using a posterior approach. Patients in the fixation arm whose fractures were irreducible in theatre were then randomised to an anterior or posterior Thompson. These were then analysed as a fourth group with no details of which surgical approach they received. Interpreting results was confusing. Follow-up of patients was for 24 months or until revision. Operative mortality in the irreducible group was reported as unacceptable. The authors concluded that the anterior hemiarthroplasty was the safest treatment . This study was excluded due to its poor methodological quality. The comparison between anterior and posterior approach is being considered in a separate Cochrane review.</P>
