<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-16 14:59:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Our review evaluated the existing evidence on immunisation with tetanus toxoid in women of reproductive age for the prevention of tetanus and death in newborn babies and to determine whether serious harms are associated with tetanus toxoid exposure.</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Tetanus in newborn babies is an infection causing rigidity, muscle spasm and often death. It is quite common in low-income countries, as a result of insufficient protection being passed from the mother to her baby during the pregnancy, together with infection entering into the baby when the umbilical cord is cut using contaminated instruments.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> The evidence is current to January 2015, the review includes three trials. Two assessed the effectiveness of vaccinating women of reproductive age (9823 infants): one (1182 newborns) assessed the effects of tetanus toxoid against polyvalent influenza in preventing tetanus and deaths within the 30th day of life; the other (8641 newborns) assessed the effects of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid against cholera toxoid administered in women of reproductive age in preventing newborn deaths. The third trial (48 women and their newborns) assessed the safety of tetanus toxoid diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) administration during pregnancy in comparison with placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>A protective effect against deaths caused by tetanus was observed among the newborns from mothers who received at least two doses of the tetanus toxoid vaccine when compared with newborns from mothers who were immunised with influenza vaccine. A similar protective effect was seen with at least two doses of the tetanus vaccine against newborn deaths. Cases of tetanus were less frequent among newborns from women who received at least one dose of tetanus toxoid. This evidence was of moderate quality. In the second trial immunisation of women of reproductive age with tetanus diphtheria toxoid had a greater protective effect against newborn deaths than did cholera vaccine. The quality of the evidence was low for this outcome. In the third study no serious adverse events (during pregnancy or in babies) were related to the receiving of Tdap vaccine. The women experienced more pain with the vaccine injection than with the placebo. The available evidence supports the implementation of immunisation programs for women of reproductive age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of tetanus in newborn babies as at the two study sites.</P>

<P>Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by <I>Clostridium tetani</I>. It occurs in newborn infants born to mothers who do not have sufficient circulating antibodies to protect the infant passively, by transplacental transfer. Prevention may be possible by the vaccination of pregnant or non-pregnant women, or both, with tetanus toxoid, and the provision of clean delivery services. Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin that stimulates the production of antitoxin.</P>

<P>Two effectiveness trials (9823 infants) and one safety trial (48 mothers) were included. The main outcomes were measured on infants born to a subset of those randomised women who became pregnant during the course of the studies. For our primary outcomes, there was no high-quality evidence according to GRADE assessments.</P>
<P>One study (1182 infants) assessed the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid in comparison with influenza vaccine in preventing neonatal tetanus deaths. A single dose did not provide significant protection against neonatal tetanus deaths, (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.24; 494 infants; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>). However, a two- or three-dose course did provide protection against neonatal deaths, (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 688 infants; GRADE: <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). Administration of a two- or three-dose course resulted in significant protection when all causes of death are considered as an outcome (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55; 688 infants; GRADE: <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). No effect was detected on causes of death other than tetanus. Cases of neonatal tetanus after at least one dose of tetanus toxoid were reduced in the tetanus toxoid group, (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.40; 1182 infants; GRADE: <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Another study, involving 8641 children, assessed the effectiveness of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid in comparison with cholera toxoid in preventing neonatal mortality after one or two doses. Neonatal mortality was reduced in the tetanus-diphtheria toxoid group (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.82). In preventing deaths at four to 14 days, neonatal mortality was reduced again in the tetanus-diphtheria toxoid group (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55). The quality of evidence as assessed using GRADE was found to be low.</P>
<P>The third small trial assessed that pain at injection site was reported more frequently among pregnant women who received tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis than placebo (RR 5.68, 95% CI 1.54 to 20.94; GRADE: <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-17 09:21:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by <I>Clostridium tetani.</I> Tetanus is characterised by generalised rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually involves the jaw and neck and then becomes generalised.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-17 09:21:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalised tetanus that occurs in newborn infants born to mothers who do not have sufficient circulating antibodies to protect the infant passively by transplacental transfer. It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with an unsterile instrument.</P>
<P>Neonatal tetanus has been for several years a major cause of childhood mortality in developing countries. In 1997 an estimated 277,376 neonatal deaths were attributed to tetanus, corresponding to a global mortality rate of 2.1 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Prevots-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prevots 1998</LINK>). More recently, as a consequence of successful vaccination programmes and application of single-dose antenatal tetanus immunisation prevention strategies, the last available worldwide World Heath Organization (WHO) estimate for deaths caused by neonatal tetanus (year 2013), was 49,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although these data represent a strong reduction in disease incidence, and in 1993 deaths due to neonatal tetanus represented 14% of the global causes of neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNFPA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA 2015</LINK>), neonatal tetanus was still responsible for about 1% of deaths that occurred among newborns worldwide in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK>). Despite impressive progress, the goal of eliminating neonatal tetanus by 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNFPA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA 2000</LINK>) was later shifted to 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Significant progress has been made in recent years. As of March 2015, neonatal tetanus remains a major public health problem (i.e. with an incidence rate of at least one neonatal tetanus case per 1000 live births at district level) in 23 countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo DR, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Yemen (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Only as recently as 2000, neonatal tetanus was a public health problem in 59 countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNFPA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA 2000</LINK>), but since that time it has been eliminated from 36 countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:00:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<I>Clostridium tetani</I> cannot be eradicated because it is ubiquitous in the environment and prevention of infection remains the mainstay of control. Current strategies toward neonatal tetanus elimination rely on a number of approaches. These include (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNFPA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA 2015</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Strengthening routine immunisation of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid vaccine. For women who have never received vaccine, a total of five properly-spaced doses is recommended: two given one month apart in the first pregnancy, the third dose at least six months later, then one dose in each subsequent pregnancy (or at intervals of at least one year), to a total of five doses.</LI>
<LI>Supplementary immunisation activities in selected high-risk areas (districts where women have limited or no access to routine vaccination, underserved populations and special groups such as nomads and displaced persons), targeting women of reproductive age with three properly-spaced doses of tetanus toxoid (high-risk approach), a minimum of four weeks interval between the first and second rounds and a minimum of six months between the second and third rounds are recommended.</LI>
<LI>Promotion of clean deliveries and clean cord care practices. Health workers encourage also the use of trained health providers for obstetric care and also provide information about how to reach such services. Extra efforts should be made to teach pregnant women how to ensure a clean delivery at home (in case obstetric services are not available or if women prefer to deliver at home), the importance of not using harmful traditional substances for cord care, and when and where to seek care for complications.</LI>
<LI>Reliable neonatal tetanus surveillance including case investigation and response. The WHO estimates that only 10% of cases and deaths occurred in developing countries have been reported. It is necessary to integrate neonatal tetanus surveillance into the existing active acute flaccid paralysis and measles surveillance to have active integrated disease surveillance for vaccine preventable diseases.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Even if eradication of tetanus is not possible and tetanus exposure cannot be completely prevented, the WHO recommends the maintenance of the following program in countries that have already reached elimination (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_WHO_x002f_UNFPA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Ensure that the majority of pregnant women (at least &gt; 80%) are immunised against tetanus.</LI>
<LI>Ensure high coverage with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines in infancy, and consider introducing booster doses in childhood and adolescence. (School-based immunisation can be an efficient and effective strategy).</LI>
<LI>Ensure access to and use of clean delivery practices and cord care.</LI>
<LI>Maintain and improve maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT) surveillance to monitor continued elimination and identify areas where MNT is still occurring.</LI>
</OL>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:00:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Tetanus toxoid has been regarded as safe and useful since Descombey first reported its production in 1924 (<LINK REF="REF-Descombey-1924" TYPE="REFERENCE">Descombey 1924</LINK>). Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin, which after a primary series of properly spaced doses, stimulates the production of an antitoxin that protects against tetanus toxin.</P>
<P>In an immunised mother, tetanus antibodies are transplacentally transferred to the fetus; this transfer is restricted to the IgG immunoglobulins only. The level of fetal IgG increases steadily from the fourth month up to delivery and at the birth is usually equal to the maternal level. This provides passive transient protection against diseases during the neonatal period. Placental antibody transfer could be reduced in the presence of other diseases (e.g. malaria or HIV infection), or multiple antigenic stimuli. The infants of mother with a sub-optimal level of antitoxin may be at risk of tetanus. Two doses of toxoid administered during pregnancy should induce the development of a protective level of antitoxin, the level of immunity induced by a course of three injections is high and durable (<LINK REF="REF-Borrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrow 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:00:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Current knowledge on vaccine efficacy and recommendations are only inferred from antitoxin levels and the availability of both field and experimental evidence on the effect of the tetanus toxoid appears to be insufficient. In order to try to help fill this gap, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of all available evidence on the subject.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Neonatal tetanus cases.</LI>
<LI>Neonatal tetanus mortality.</LI>
<LI>Neonatal mortality (all causes).</LI>
<LI>Serious harms.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) to import data from <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>There are no included cluster-randomised trials. If we identify any in the futures, we will include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either the Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:03:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary would have been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not intend to combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, we planned to present the results as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For this systematic review only two experimental studies assessing the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid in preventing neonatal tetanus have been found (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newell-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 1966</LINK>). The size of the population included in the studies and the consistency of the results allow us to draw some conclusions. One study exclusively randomised non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1980</LINK>). The main outcomes were measured on infants born to a subset of those randomised women who became pregnant during the course of the studies. One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2014</LINK>) reported local and systemic reactions observed after administration of tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine to pregnant women.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:09:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a moderate level of evidence that the effectiveness of vaccination with tetanus toxoid in preventing deaths from neonatal tetanus appears to be high when two or more doses are administered. Tetanus toxoid is also effective in preventing cases of neonatal tetanus (moderate level of evidence). The vaccination does not exert effects on causes of death other than tetanus, even when two or three doses have been administered (<I>moderate level of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The two studies apparently show differences in the estimates of effect, but these differences are understandable when considering that the study showing lower effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1980</LINK>), was assessing a different intervention (vaccination with only one or two doses) and a less specific outcome (all causes neonatal deaths occurring four to 14 days from birth, <I>low level of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In the interpretation of the results, it must be also considered that one study (<LINK REF="STD-Newell-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 1966</LINK>), had a third arm containing participants who refused vaccination and that data from this arm were not included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Because of the limited number of eligible experimental studies included in this review, we decided to carry out an extended search in order to retrieve all the available comparative studies on this topic. The same databases were explored in order to identify cohort, case-control studies and other non-randomised study designs. Seven further studies were identified (four surveys comparing the disease incidence before and after the introduction of the immunisation campaign, two case-control studies and a cohort study). The characteristics of these studies are summarised in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Altogether 37,352 births were surveyed by the prospective studies and 552 participants were included in the case-control studies. All the studies but one confirmed the existence of a significant protective effect of an immunisation course of at least two doses of tetanus toxoid on the incidence of neonatal tetanus.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects from non-experimental studies</HEADING>
<P>Among the excluded studies, we identified two studies evaluating the safety of tetanus toxoid. One was carried out in order to evaluate of the safety of different types of vaccine's adjuvants (<LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-1965" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 1965</LINK>) and the second was a case-control study assessing the association between vaccination and congenital anomalies (<LINK REF="STD-Silveira-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silveira 1995</LINK>). In one further study (<LINK REF="STD-Salama-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salama 2009</LINK>), pregnant women experienced pain at injection site more frequently after combined tetanus diphtheria administration than after tetanus toxoid alone. Their characteristics are described in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:09:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In conclusion, this review shows that vaccination of women with tetanus toxoid is effective in preventing neonatal tetanus cases and deaths specifically caused by neonatal tetanus. Even if the evidence is derived mainly from a single study, this appears to be solid and consistent with the findings of all other comparative studies presently available.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-16 15:09:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two trials performed on 9823 newborns assessing effectiveness of vaccination and one trial including 48 pregnant women assessing the occurrence of local and systemic following vaccine administration were included in the review. A certain degree of bias in selection could affect effectiveness estimates in <LINK REF="STD-Newell-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 1966</LINK>, as some participant refused to participate after allocation and during administration (labels on the vials were of different colours and it was noticed early on in the trial that injection with one of the two preparations was more painful). For these reasons (downgrading of Design &amp; Implementation due to selection bias), the GRADE level of evidence relative to the effect estimate of two or three doses of tetanus toxoid in preventing neonatal tetanus deaths, all causes of death within the first 30 days of life and of at least one dose of toxoid in preventing neonatal tetanus cases is moderate. GRADE level relative to the effect estimate of one tetanus toxoid dose in preventing neonatal tetanus deaths and all causes of death within the first 30 day of life is low because there is further downgrading due to imprecision. In <LINK REF="STD-Black-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1980</LINK>, information about allocation and blinding in the report were insufficient (Design &amp; Implementation, selection bias); authors used an indirect outcome for neonatal tetanus mortality (indirectness). The GRADE level of evidence for the effect estimate of tetanus diphtheria immunisation during pregnancy in preventing neonatal mortality is low. <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2014</LINK> was performed on a limited number of participants (48) and was not powered to test any specific hypothesis and not suitable for detecting rare vaccine-related events (imprecision). Only the first part of the study has been included in analysis and considered as a parallel group trial. The GRADE level of effect estimates for local and systemic reactions is moderate.</P>
<P>The reasons for the low performance presently achieved by the vaccination campaigns should be sought outside the field of vaccine efficacy and are probably related to organisational and quality issues. Our review did not find evidence on the main factors that can have negative influence on the impact of the immunisation practice and that may justify the present low level of performance of the campaign (<LINK REF="REF-Dietz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>).</P>

<TD>
<P>2 studies are reported in this paper:<BR/>a) 1 cluster-RCT evaluating reactogenicity and side-effects;<BR/>b) 1 RCT assessing safety only, with a 24-weeks' follow-up.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Both studies were performed in New Guinea on indigenous populations.<BR/>a) Pregnant women belonging to the Abelam tribe (n = 179).<BR/>b) Non-pregnant women from the Maprik area (n = 999).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>a) TT prepared by Parke Davis &amp; co with different adjuvants and administered in different doses (Drakeol, 1 dose vs H - 24, 1 dose vs AlPO4, 2 doses vs none, 3 doses) or TT prepared by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories without adjuvant, 3 doses.<BR/>b) TT prepared by Parke Davis &amp; co with Drakeol (A, 1 dose) vs H - 24 (B, 1 dose) vs AlPO4 (C, 2 doses).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>a) Swelling (severe or no tender).<BR/>b) Abscess (A = 103 /327; B = 96/332; C = 2/340 at the 14th week after immunisation).<BR/>c) Fever between 37.8 to 38.3 캜.<BR/>d) Swelling.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Although oil-adjuvated preparations provide longer persistence of antitoxin and require to be administered only once, they caused frequently severe side-effects. The Al-adjuvated preparations, administered in 2 doses, appeared to be the best way at the time of the study to prevent the occurrence of NNT.</P>

<P>Retrospective Cohort study</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>- Exposed cohort: 138 women aged between 12 and 45 years with documented Tdap immunisation during pregnancy. They were identified among the 162,448 pregnancies occurred within the Intermountain Healthcare facilities (Salt Lake, Utah) between May 2005 and August 2009.</P>
<P>- Not exposed cohort: 552 randomly selected women from the same population (without documented vaccination during pregnancy).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In the exposed cohort Tdap immunisation occurred more frequently within 1st (63%), than during 2nd (17%) and 3rd (20%) pregnancy trimester. Immunisation with Tdap occurred mainly as prophylactic measure in consequence of wound, trauma or routine health supervision.</P>
