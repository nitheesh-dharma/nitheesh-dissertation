The main treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high-dose antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. GABA agonist drugs have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia but have intense sedative properties and may make mental health or psychotic symptoms worse. GABA agonist drugs include baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate, and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol (THIP).</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B>.</P><P>The review includes 11 studies investigating the use of GABA agonist drugs compared with placebo. All studies involved small numbers of participants (2 to 80 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.</P><P><B>Key results</B>.</P><P>Evidence of the effects of GABA agonist drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is not conclusive and not convincing. Any possible benefits of GABA agonist drugs are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their use.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B>.</P><P>Evidence is weak, short term, small scale and poorly reported. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.</P><P>This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (<A HREF="http://mcpin.org/">http://mcpin.org/</A>).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-19 15:53:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-28 10:19:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>Chronic antipsychotic drug treatment may cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a long-term movement disorder.

Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-19 15:53:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 11 studies that randomised 343 people. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, participants and outcome assessors were not clearly blinded. For some studies we were unsure if data were complete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported.</P><P>Data from six trials showed that there may be a clinically important improvement in TD symptoms after GABA agonist treatment compared with placebo at six to eight weeks follow-up (6 RCTs, n = 258, RR 0.83, CI 0.74 to 0.92; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Data from five studies showed no difference between GABA agonist treatment and placebo for deterioration of TD symptoms (5 RCTs, n = 136, RR 1.90, CI 0.70 to 5.16; very low-quality evidence). Studies reporting adverse events found a significant effect favouring placebo compared with baclofen, sodium valproate or progabide for dizziness/confusion (3 RCTs, n = 62 RR 4.54, CI 1.14 to 18.11; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) and sedation/drowsiness (4 RCTS, n = 144, RR 2.29, CI 1.08 to 4.86; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Studies reporting on akathisia (RR 1.05, CI 0.32 to 3.49, 2 RCTs, 80 participants), ataxia (RR 3.25, CI 0.36 to 29.73, 2 RCTs, 95 participants), nausea/vomiting (RR 2.61, CI 0.79 to 8.67, 2 RCTs, 64 participants), loss of muscle tone (RR 3.00, CI 0.15 to 59.89, 1 RCT, 10 participants), seizures (RR 3.00, CI 0.24 to 37.67, 1 RCT, 2 participants), hypotension (RR 3.04, CI 0.33 to 28.31, 2 RCTs, 119 participants) found no significant difference between GABA drug and placebo (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Evidence on mental state also showed no effect between treatment groups (6 RCTS, n = 121, RR 2.65, CI 0.71 to 9.86; v<I>ery low-quality evidence</I>) as did data for leaving the study early (around 10% in both groups, 6 RCTS, n = 218, RR 1.47, CI 0.69 to 3.15; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).

Its occurrence is estimated to be 20% to 50% of those on long-standing therapy with conventional antipsychotics depending on the characteristics of the population studied (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>). Every year 4% to 5% of those who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Elderly patients are at five to six times greater risk to develop TD (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 2000</LINK>). This disorder can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P><P>The exact mechanisms of the pathophysiology of TD are unknown. Many preclinical models, one of them being the dopamine receptor hypersensitivity hypothesis, have been developed to explain the underlying pathophysiology, but none has yet provided an unequivocal explanation (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2000</LINK>). Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain - one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). The interaction between antipsychotic drugs and the dopamine cells has been proposed as the mechanism for their beneficial effects in psychoses as well as the cause of the movement side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1982</LINK>). The most interesting and consistent findings regarding candidate gene studies of TD have focused on the dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3). Several groups have reported an association between a serineto-glycine polymorphism in exon 1 of the DRD3 gene and TD (<LINK REF="REF-Bakker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakker 2006</LINK>). Specifically, each group found that either the glycine/glycine genotype or the glycine allele conferred an elevated risk for TD compared with serine/serine homozygotes. One study found a high frequency of this type of homozygosity (22% to 24%) among patients with TD compared with the relative under-representation (4% to 6%) of this genotype in patients without TD (<LINK REF="REF-Steen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 1997</LINK>). This may be an explanation to the susceptibility for TD development in some but not most patients.<BR/></P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-19 15:48:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There are many drugs in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) family. Baclofen (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), gamma-vinyl-GABA, gamma-acetylenic-GABA, progabide, muscimol (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), sodium valproate (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridine (THIP) are the focus of this review, and the benzodiazepines, a large group in themselves, have been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2018" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2018</LINK>). The GABA agonist drugs have been trialled as a treatment for people with TD, despite their sedative properties, and the possibility that they may exacerbate psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardos 1994</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in specific cells of the brain (neurones from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). This, in turn, leads to inactivity in another set of cells in the brain, which employ another neurochemical, GABA (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). The GABA agonists supplement the function of these underactive cells. There is also evidence from animal experiments to suggest that GABA dysfunction may be associated with movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Gunne-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunne 1984</LINK>).<BR/></P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-27 12:54:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several atypical antipsychotic drugs have been produced in the last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does point to the fact that thoughtful use of older generation drugs is not associated with any more problems of TD than with newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs - such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol - will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and, therefore, TD will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>Given the high incidence and prevalence of TD among people taking antipsychotic medication, the need for prevention or treatment is clear. Unfortunately, there has been sparse evidence to guide clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2009</LINK>). Although many treatments have been tested, no one intervention has been shown clearly to be effective. Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication is the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many individuals such a reduction would lead to relapse.

If studies were multi-centre, where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre separately.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.

We realise that this is not often reported clearly, we noted in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> if this was the case or not.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING><P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/></P><P>Please note, we entered data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies &lt; 200 participants:</P><P>(a) when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than one but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether their inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2 we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING><P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for GABA agonist drugs. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not un-improved'), we presented data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome and noted this in the relevant graphs.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></DATA_EXTRACTION><QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-19 15:53:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>RA and HB independently assessed risk of bias within the included studies by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P><P>If the raters disagreed, we made the final rating by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. If non-concurrence occurred, we reported this.</P><P>We noted the level of risk of bias in the text of the review and in <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P></QUALITY_ASSESSMENT><EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING><P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios as odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING><P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P></SUBSECTION></EFFECT_MEASURES><UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING><P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8  (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (</I><LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>.</I> We did not use data where the additional treatment arms were not relevant.</P></SUBSECTION></UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS><MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING><P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table by down-rating quality. We also downgraded quality within the 'Summary of findings' table should loss be 25%-50% in total.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING><P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). We assumed all those leaving the study early had no improvement. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change by comparing data only from people who completed the study to that point to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Continuous</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Attrition</HEADING><P>We reported and used data where attrition for a continuous outcome was between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who completed the study to that point were reported.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING><P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either a P value or t value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, sSDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches. (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.

The search</HEADING><P>This area of research does not seem to be active. The 2017 update has identified additional data, but most trials predate the year 2000, only two were carried out after then, published in 2004 and 2008. This could be because of reasons such as less concern with tardive dyskinesia (TD), or less emergence of the problem in research-active communities because of more thoughtful use of antipsychotic drugs, or loss of faith in GABA agonists as a potential treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Few data</HEADING><P>Only a little under 350 people have been involved in placebo-controlled trials of GABA agonists for TD. It is possible that real, and important, effects have not been highlighted because of the necessarily wide confidence intervals (CIs) of the findings. Many outcomes were not measured at all (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), including one of our pre-stated outcome measures. We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of these outcomes in TD trials but simple reporting of satisfaction with care or quality of life still does not seem too demanding and does remain of interest.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison 1: GABA agonist drugs versus placebo</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 TD symptoms</HEADING><P>There was low-quality evidence from six trials that there may be a clinically important improvement in TD symptoms after GABA agonist treatment compared with placebo at six to eight weeks follow-up (6 RCTs, n = 258, RR 0.83, CI 0.74 to 0.92). The evidence on deterioration of TD symptoms was of very low quality (5 RCTs, n = 136, RR 1.90, CI 0.70 to 5.16).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse effects</HEADING><P>All GABA agonist drugs are associated with adverse effects and a possible deleterious (harmful to the mind or body) effect on people's mental state. Even with the very limited data in this review, there are suggestions that these adverse effects could be prohibitive of use of GABA agonist drugs. Adverse effects seem to be a major problem for these drugs when used for people with antipsychotic-induced TD. Traditional reviews have also reported that high side-effect rates limit the use of GABA agonists (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1988</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Mental state</HEADING><P>Seven trials reported on mental state. Six reported on number of participants that experienced a deterioration in mental state, and one trial used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scale. There was no suggestion that GABA agonists had any more effect on mental state than placebo (very low-quality evidence, RR 2.65, CI 0.71 to 9.86; 6 RCTs, 121 people).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Leaving the study early</HEADING><P>It is always unclear what leaving the study early means. It could be to do with the participant not accepting treatment for a series of reasons, or of participants finding the trial intolerable. It also could be a function of a trial design in which willing participants are still asked to leave because of some degree of protocol violation. In any event, around 10% of people left the study early, and this was not significantly different for those allocated to either group (6 RCTs, n = 218, RR 1.47, CI 0.69 to 3.15).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.5 Social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life</HEADING><P>This group of outcomes was selected as being of importance to patients for the 2016 review update following a service user consultation.

Completeness</HEADING><P>The majority of studies had a duration of less than six weeks, whilst only three actually had a duration of six weeks. Whether the effects of the drugs were maintained at longer periods of follow-up may therefore be under-reported in short-term studies.</P><P>Outcome reporting was mainly symptom- and physician-oriented. Patient-oriented global and functional outcomes, such as social functioning, ability to work, patient and carer satisfaction and family burden were not reported. There is clearly a need for studies focusing not only on symptoms, but also on general and social functioning, family burden and patient acceptability.<BR/></P><P>Overall, sample sizes in relevant studies were particularly small and the completeness of evidence for those suffering from antipsychotic-induced TD is poor.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2.

The largest trial in this area randomised only 80 people. A trial of this size is unable to detect subtle, yet important differences due to GABA agonists with any confidence. Overall, the quality of reporting of these trials was poor (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded. We are also unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported or if other biases were operating. The small trial size, along with the poor reporting of trials, would be associated with an exaggeration of effect of the experimental treatment (<LINK REF="REF-J_x0171_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">J&#369;ni 2001</LINK>) if an effect had been detected. This is only evident for the outcome of &#8216;Tardive dyskinesia: Not improved to a clinically important extent&#8217; where there is indeed an effect favouring the GABA agonist drug group.

Missing studies</HEADING><P>Every effort was made to identify relevant trials. However, these studies are all small and it is likely that we have failed to identify other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would also not be in favour of the GABA agonist group. If they had been so, it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible literature. We do not, however, think it likely that we have failed to identify large relevant studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Introducing bias</HEADING><P>We have tried to be balanced in our appraisal of the evidence but could have inadvertently introduced bias. We welcome comments or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all or had to report data in a different way. We think the 'Summary of findings' table to be a valuable innovation &#8211; but problematic to those not &#8216;blind&#8217; to the outcome data. It is possible to &#8216;cherry pick&#8217; significant findings for presentation in this table. We have tried to decrease the chance of doing this by asking a new review author (HB) to select outcomes relevant for this table before becoming familiar with the data.</P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-06 15:39:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review substantially updates and largely concurs with findings from the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Alabed-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alabed 2011</LINK>).

For people with antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD)</HEADING><P>Currently, evidence of any positive effect of baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate or THIP (tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol) for people with antipsychotic-induced TD is weak. It would seem advisable to take such medications only if the problem is intractable and in the context of a well-designed study.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>Any possible benefits are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with the use of these drugs.

Destruction of data</HEADING><P>Authors have destroyed data from relevant studies conducted only nine years before being requested for the first version of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Ananth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ananth 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Friis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1985</LINK> - personal communication). It would be helpful for trialists to archive their data, in perpetuity, to allow them to be used to their full value. This would help give recognition to the important, and often pioneering, work of researchers.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Incomplete reporting</HEADING><P>Randomised trials in this review were poorly or incompletely reported. Assumptions about the allocation of people who left early had to be made in order to allow intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Only two studies specified how randomisation was undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Fisk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fisk 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mei-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mei 2008</LINK>). In one trial, personal communication with the principal investigator clarified that people who left early during the intervention were excluded from final analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1985</LINK>), and that it was unclear exactly how many were initially randomised. Complete reporting of both methodological details and information about those who entered but did not complete the study would be helpful.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Study design</HEADING><P>All included studies used the treatments for no longer than eight weeks and for small groups of people (fewer than 40 people in each group). Half the included trials used a cross-over design. This design is not well-suited to evaluate interventions for TD. Brief interventions make the detection of change difficult to separate out from background variations, and there is a high risk of carry-over effects after people have received active treatment. Another problem to be considered is the use of different scales to measure the symptoms of TD. These scales have been validated to measure the severity of the TD symptoms, but their use to measure change directly related to treatment is less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1984</LINK>). Poor design influences the estimation of treatment effects in trials and systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Based on the weak and unpromising evidence of positive effects and the known adverse effects of GABA agonists, we believe that the drugs in this review are not good candidates for future trials and therefore discourage further investigations into them.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-04-12 11:46:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">1.

In addition, to ensure reliability, KSW inspected a random sample of these abstracts, comprising 10% of the total. Where disagreement occurred we resolved this by discussion, or where there was still doubt, acquired the full article for further inspection. We acquired the full articles of relevant reports for reassessment and carefully inspected them for a final decision on inclusion (see <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>). Once we obtained the full articles, NS and KSW in turn inspected all full reports and independently decided whether they met inclusion criteria. NS and KSW were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Where difficulties or disputes arose, we asked author JM for help and if it was impossible to decide, added these studies to those awaiting assessment and contacted the authors of the papers for clarification.

Again, we discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and, if necessary, contacted authors of studies for clarification. With remaining problems JM helped clarify issues, and we documented those final decisions. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included these only if two authors independently had the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary. Where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre of multi-centre studies separately. For the update (July 2010) AS and RA (see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>) independently inspected each report identified by the search, and discussed any doubts with LY and MH.<BR/></P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Management</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING><P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING><P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>);<BR/>b. the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial; and<BR/>c. the measuring instrument is either i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING><P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aim to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion.<BR/>a) Standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors.<BR/>b) When a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>).<BR/>c) If a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. We generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), we could consider this as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING><P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for intensive case management.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.8 Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING><P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.9 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING><P>We anticipated including the following short- or medium-term outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table.

This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P><P>The categories are defined below.</P><P>- Yes - low risk of bias<BR/>- NO - high risk of bias<BR/>- UNCLEAR - uncertain risk of bias</P><P>For example, if the sequence generation process within the trial was by quasi-random means, such as by hospital record numbers, we noted this and gave the study a "No - high risk of bias" rating. If data from such studies did not differ from the results of higher grade trials, we have presented these. We have not included trials with high risk of bias (defined as at least three out of five domains categorized as 'No') in the meta-analysis. If the raters disagreed, we made the final rating by consensus with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials are provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. We have reported non-concurrence in quality assessment, but if disputes arose as to which category a trial had to be allocated, again, we achieved resolution by discussion.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING><P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, was superseded by 'Summary of findings' table 1 and the calculations therein.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Summary statistic</HEADING><P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, had scales of very considerable similarity been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC (Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies has been appropriately analysed taking into account ICC and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING><P>At some degree of loss of follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2007</LINK>). For any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING><P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0 and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we have presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes were to change when 'completed' data only were compared to the ITT analysis using the above assumption.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Continuous</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Attrition</HEADING><P>In the case where attrition for a continuous outcome is between 0 and 50% and completer-only data were reported, we have reproduced these.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING><P>We first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error and confidence interval (CI) were available for group means, and either 'P' value or 'T' value were available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). When only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics. If these formula do not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING><P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The I<SUP>2 </SUP>provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a CI for I<SUP>2</SUP>). We interpreted I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). When we found substantial levels of heterogeneity in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING><P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We tried to locate protocols of included trials. If the protocol was available, we compared outcomes in the protocol and in the published report. If the protocol was not available, we compared outcomes listed in the methods section of the trial report with actually reported results. In addition a funnel plot (included trial effect size versus included trial size) may be useful in investigating publication biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING><P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. Therefore, we chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random model.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.
