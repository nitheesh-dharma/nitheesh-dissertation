<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-29 19:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dental plaque</HEADING>
<P>Dental plaque is the primary causal factor both in gingivitis (gum inflammation) and periodontitis (loss of bone around the teeth) although the link between the two is complex and not well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Loe-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loe 1965</LINK>). Periodontitis can lead to tooth loss (<LINK REF="REF-Lorentz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorentz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, good oral hygiene (the removal of plaque) by effective toothbrushing has a key role in oral health with the prevention of periodontal disease and caries (<LINK REF="REF-Axelsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelsson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Axelsson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelsson 1981</LINK>). Effective toothbrushing depends on a number of factors including motivation, knowledge and manual dexterity.</P>
<P>The relationship between oral cleanliness and caries is not clear-cut (<LINK REF="REF-Addy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1977</LINK>) unless a fluoride toothpaste is used. This is due more to the effect of fluoride than brushing per se (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In clinical trials assessing the levels of plaque, indices are commonly used to quantify the amount of plaque present on the surfaces of teeth. Among the most commonly used of these is the Quigley &amp; Hein Index (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 1962</LINK>) with/out the Turesky modification (<LINK REF="REF-Turesky-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turesky 1970</LINK>). Such indices have become popular due to their ease of use, both in terms of time and lack of specialised equipment required. However, they have ordinal scales which creates problems when interpreting the clinical relevance of the data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Toothbrushing</HEADING>
<P>Powered toothbrushes were first introduced commercially in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Chilton-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilton 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cross-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliot-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoover-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoover 1962</LINK>) and have become established as an alternative to manual methods of toothbrushing. They simulate the manual motion of toothbrushes. A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>) compared powered toothbrushes with manual toothbrushes and concluded that only powered toothbrushes with a rotation oscillation action were more effective at removing plaque and reducing gingivitis than manual brushing. This review did not allow direct comparison between the different modes of powered toothbrushes. Therefore the question remains: Which powered toothbrushes may perform better, at reducing plaque and gingivitis?</P>
<P>Powered toothbrushes have been designed with different movements of the bristles. It is therefore important to assess whether they cause damage to the gingival tissues during use (<LINK REF="REF-Addy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addy 2003</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-03-18 18:36:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review is confined to studies comparing two or more powered brushes with different modes of action. Trials comparing powered toothbrushes with the same mode of action were not included. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that clearly implied randomisation were included. Where the method of randomisation was unclear, the authors were contacted to request clarification. Cross-over trials were eligible to be included. This study design has been shown to be a valid method of assessing the efficacy of toothbrushes in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-McCracken-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCracken 2005</LINK>). Split-mouth trials were excluded as these are not considered representative of 'everyday use'.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-18 14:20:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Toothbrushes reviewed were all forms of powered brush with mechanical movement of the brush head (i.e. electric, electronic, sonic, ultrasound etc.) or with power delivered to the brush head (i.e. ionic). The brushes were grouped according to their mode of action. This included.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Side to side action, indicates a brush head action that moves laterally side to side.</LI>
<LI>Counter oscillation, indicates a brush action in which adjacent tufts of bristles (usually 6 to 10 in number) rotate in one direction and then the other, independently. Each tuft rotating in the opposite direction to that adjacent to it.</LI>
<LI>Rotation oscillation, indicates a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other.</LI>
<LI>Circular, indicates a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction.</LI>
<LI>Ultrasonic, indicates a brush action where the bristles vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies (&gt; 20 kHz).</LI>
<LI>Ionic, indicates a brush which applies a low electric current to the bristles during toothbrushing. The aim of the brush is to change the charge polarity of the tooth with the purpose of attracting dental plaque away from the tooth towards the bristles. Such brushes have no powered mechanical action.</LI>
<LI>Multidimensional, indicates a brush with more than one action. Such brushes usually include two of the above action types. This additional mode of action was added during the review process to reflect the advances in toothbrush design that have occurred in recent years.</LI>
<LI>Unknown, indicates a brush action that the review authors have been unable to establish based on the trial report or confirm with the manufacturers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Combined interventions, e.g. brushing combined with the use of mouthrinses or irrigation were excluded. However, trials where subjects were permitted to continue with their usual personal adjuncts to oral hygiene, such as flossing, in both groups, were considered for inclusion. Trials where professional or supervised brushing was used were excluded. Trials of 28 days and over were eligible. We also aimed to undertake a subgroup analysis on the duration of trials for the different outcome measurements.</P>
<P>As with the previous reviews comparing powered and manual toothbrushes (<LINK REF="REF-Heanue-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heanue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>) it was considered that the analysis of filament arrangement, orientation, size, shape and flexibility, brush head size and shape along with presence or absence and characteristics of a timer would prove difficult to define across time and brush types. These factors have therefore not been assessed in this current review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The outcome measures used were quantified levels of plaque or gingivitis or both.</P>
<P>Values recorded on arrival at the assessment were used, not those after subjects have been instructed to brush their teeth. It was assumed that plaque scores achieved during toothbrushing under these circumstances would not reflect scores achieved in normal home use. Gingival scores were included as these were assumed not to be altered by supervised brushing immediately before assessment. Where several outcome measures for plaque or gingivitis were reported, the data entered for analysis were selected according to an index hierarchy developed on a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Heanue-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heanue 2003</LINK>). This was developed to handle the many different indices of plaque and gingivitis which are used across trials, with some trials reporting multiple indices. A frequencies table was prepared of the indices used and they were ranked based on common usage and simplicity. Therefore for plaque when multiple indices were reported the data extracted, where possible, were reported using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (<LINK REF="REF-Turesky-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turesky 1970</LINK>). For gingival inflammation when multiple indices were reported the data extracted, where possible, were reported as the gingival index of Loe and Silness (<LINK REF="REF-Loe-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loe 1963</LINK>) or, if unavailable, bleeding on probing (<LINK REF="REF-Ainamo-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ainamo 1975</LINK>). When available, data were extracted for whole mouth rather than part mouth scores. Where only part mouth scores were reported, they were extracted with the intention of performing a sensitivity analysis to consider their impact on the results of the review. Part mouth scoring was assumed if plaque and/or gingivitis were not recorded around all erupted teeth, except third molars.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data extraction was performed independently by two review authors and the authors of trials contacted to provide missing data where possible.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias in included studies was assessed independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Included trials were assessed on the following key criteria:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>generation of random sequence</LI>
<LI>concealed allocation of treatment</LI>
<LI>blind outcome assessment</LI>
<LI>handling of withdrawals/drop outs.</LI>

<P>Details on the following criteria were also recorded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comparability of groups at baseline/adjustment for confounding factors</LI>
<LI>clear inclusion/exclusion criteria</LI>
<LI>method of assessment (valid assessment criteria)</LI>
<LI>duration of follow-up</LI>
<LI>power of study/a priori calculation of sample size.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Where there was uncertainty authors were contacted for clarification. The agreement on methodological assessment is reported using Kappa statistics in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section below.</P>
<P>A description of the key quality items was tabulated for each included trial, and a judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias made. Criteria for risk of bias judgements regarding allocation concealment are given below as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias - adequate concealment of the allocation (e.g. sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias - uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (e.g. where the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias - inadequate allocation concealment (e.g. open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, date of birth, or case record number).</LI>
</UL>
<P>A summary assessment of the risk of bias for the primary outcomes (across domains) was undertaken <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Within a study, a summary assessment of low risk of bias was given when there was a low risk of bias for all key domains, unclear risk of bias when there was an unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains, and high risk of bias when there was a high risk of bias for one or more key domains. Across studies, a summary assessment was rated as low risk of bias when most information was from studies at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias when most information was from studies at low or unclear risk of bias, and high risk of bias when the proportion of information was from studies at high risk of bias sufficient to affect the interpretation of the results.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary statistics and overall effect size</HEADING>
<P>Primary analyses compared the relative effectiveness of the toothbrush modes of action. Studies are grouped according to time of outcome measurements. Short term is defined as an outcome measured between 4 weeks and 3 months. Long term is defined as an outcome measured after 3 months or more. For trials presenting more than one outcome measurement within a time period, the last outcome in that time period was entered.</P>
<P>Different indices for plaque measurement exist, using the same concept on different scales. Although the different scales measure very similar constructs, it is not possible to combine the results from different indices. Therefore, the effects were expressed as standardised values, which have no units, before combining. The standardised mean difference (SMD) was therefore calculated along with the appropriate 95% confidence intervals (CI) and was used as the effect measure for each meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Statistical values such as SMD have no inherent clinical meaning. We therefore back-translated them to clinical indices using a study with similar SMDs. Such examples are given in the discussion. Random-effects models were performed unless fewer than four trials in an analysis, when a fixed-effect model was used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity and investigation of reasons for heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity was assessed by inspection of trial characteristics, a graphical display of the estimated treatment effects from the trials along with their 95% CI, and by Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Subgroup analyses were to be undertaken for assessments based on full mouth recording versus those based on a partial recording and to examine the effects of concealed allocation, randomisation generation and blind outcome assessment on the overall estimates of effect for important outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Data from cross-over trials were combined with that of similar parallel group trials, using the techniques described by Elbourne and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigation of publication and other biases</HEADING>
<P>We intended to use funnel plots (plots of effect estimates versus the inverse of their standard errors) to assess reporting biases. Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias and other biases related to sample size, though it may also represent a true relationship between trial size and effect size. A formal investigation of the degree of asymmetry was to be performed using the method proposed by Egger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). A further method proposed by Begg and Mazumdar which tests for publication bias by determining if there is a significant correlation between the effect estimates and their variances was also to be carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>). Both methods were to be carried out using Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the program Metabias. Due to the low number of included trials neither of these tests was carried out.</P>

From a professional perspective, dentists want to assist their patients with the long term maintenance of their oral health. The findings of this review do not support the use of any particular mode of action for powered brushes. No mode of action was consistently superior across all outcomes/time periods studied.</P>
<P>When pooling was achievable without significant heterogeneity, data supported the superiority of rotation oscillation over side to side modes of action in the short term for plaque reduction and a similar effect was a likely on gingivitis. Clinically the relative superiority of the rotation oscillation mode of action to the side to side mode of action would equate to a 7% reduction in Turesky plaque scores at the significance level demonstrated in the meta-analysis using the data from one of the trials with a similar standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Grossman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grossman 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Few other definitive conclusions could be drawn due to the small number of studies included in the review. No mode of action consistently proved to be superior to other modes of action when assessed over short and longer time periods and by plaque and gingival scores. Analysis of the longer term effects (&gt; 3 months) is particularly hampered by the lack of trials, with only one trial reporting any outcome after 3 months. As is often the case, it must be stressed, that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and it may be that future trials may show superiority of specific toothbrush designs.</P>
<P>Previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Heanue-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heanue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>) indicated that powered brushes with a rotation oscillation mode of action were more effective at reducing plaque and gingivitis when compared to manual brushes. No other powered brushes showed consistent reductions in plaque and gingivitis when compared to manual brushes. The findings of these earlier reviews have sometimes been interpreted to suggest that rotation oscillation brushes are more effective than powered brushes with other modes of action. The results in this current review may be compatible with such indirect comparisons. Indirect and direct comparisons have yielded conflicting findings in other systematic reviews, in part because indirect comparisons are susceptible to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Glenny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There may be other clinical outcomes from oral hygiene with powered toothbrushes, including changed incidence and progression of periodontitis or dental caries, and further research may be required using these outcomes. In addition, there are other reasons people chose to use a particular type of toothbrush, which may or may not be related to clinical outcomes, including avoiding bad breath, improving the appearance of the teeth and because they like to use technological solutions. The ease and comfort of use are also factors which decide the purchase of these products. These factors fall outside the scope of this review, but may also warrant further research.</P>
<P>No data were reported on the costs or reliability of the brushes. The problems reported were injuries to the gingivae, which were minor and transient, and some discomfort with use. Randomised controlled trials may not be the best research design for investigating these adverse outcomes. Expert groups have suggested that powered toothbrushes are safe if used correctly but further research is required in these areas (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A possible weakness of this review was the grouping of toothbrushes by their modes of action. This was attempted to allow more powerful meta-analysis. Subtle differences between powered brushes could therefore not be analysed. This grouping also reduced the number of trials entered, as some trials compared different brushes with the same mode of action, therefore these were not included. Similarly, many other factors may influence the effectiveness of toothbrushes including filament arrangement, orientation, size, shape and flexibility, brush head size and shape along with presence or absence and characteristics of a timer, so that not all of them could be isolated and analysed. Whether the brush has a battery or rechargeable power source may also be important.</P>

<P>Powered brushing offers a method of controlling both plaque and gingivitis. There is some evidence that rotation oscillation brushes reduce plaque and gingivitis reduction more than side to side brushes in the short term. This difference is small and it's clinical importance is unclear. Rotation oscillation brushes were also more effective at reducing plaque and gingivitis when compared to manual brushing (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>). At present the superiority of any other mode of powered brushing has not been established. Further research is required before evidence based advice concerning the relative performance of the different powered toothbrushes can be given by healthcare professionals to the public.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-29 20:05:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials of good quality as suggested previously (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>) will help to assess whether any other modes of action are superior. These recommendations include: following CONSORT guidelines, greater standardisation of the indices used to measure plaque and gingivitis and trials which utilise longer follow-up periods to establish the long term effects of the different modes of powered toothbrushing.</P>

<P>Since the protocol was published it has become obvious that manufacturers are increasing the complexity of the mode of action with newer brush technologies. Therefore to include these types of brushes we added a further mode of action category 'multidimensional' which included brush types with more than one predominant movement.</P>
<P>Title has also been changed from 'Powered toothbrushes for oral health' to 'Different powered toothbrushes for plaque control and gingival health'.</P>
