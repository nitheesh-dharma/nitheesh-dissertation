<P>Preterm infants are often much smaller than term infants by the time that they are discharged home from hospital. This review appraised trials that evaluated whether feeding these infants with breast milk fortified with added nutrients rather than unfortified breast milk would increase growth rates and benefit development.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-13 16:59:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most preterm infants accumulate energy, protein, mineral, and other nutrient deficits by the time of discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2001</LINK>). At this stage, many preterm infants, especially those born with extremely low birth weight, are substantially growth restricted (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). Following hospital discharge, demand-fed preterm infants consume greater volumes of milk than term infants of the same postmenstrual age in order to attain some "catch up" growth (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992</LINK>). Despite this, growth deficits can persist through infancy and beyond (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Euser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2008</LINK>). Slow postnatal growth in preterm infants is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in later childhood and with poorer cognitive and educational outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2003</LINK>). Preterm infants who have accumulated deficits in calcium and phosphate by the time of hospital discharge have a higher risk of low bone mineralisation, metabolic bone disease, and slow skeletal growth compared with infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Rigo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigo 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, concern exists that nutritional deficiency and growth restriction in utero and during early infancy may have consequences for long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huxley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxley 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-15 16:21:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although human milk is the recommended nutritional source for newborn infants for at least the first six months of postnatal life (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>), unfortified human breast milk may not meet the recommended nutritional needs of growing preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2007</LINK>). Feeding preterm infants prior to hospital discharge with expressed human breast milk fortified with energy, protein, and minerals is associated with short-term increases in rates of weight gain and linear and head growth (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004a</LINK>). Multinutrient breast milk fortifiers contain various amounts of protein, carbohydrate, minerals, and vitamins. These liquid or powder formulations are mixed with expressed breast milk for delivery with the aim of achieving about 5% to 10% nutrient enrichment (<LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2000</LINK>). However, standard clinical practice has been to cease multinutrient fortification during the period prior to hospital discharge when breast feeding is being established since, following hospital discharge, human milk-fed preterm infants usually obtain most of their milk directly from the breast.</P>
<P>It is feasible to continue nutritional supplementation for human milk-fed preterm infants in the post hospital discharge period of early infancy. Multinutrient fortification may be more practical for infants who are fed expressed breast milk (rather than directly from the breast) and may be especially important for infants who receive donated expressed breast milk which may contain lower levels of energy, protein and minerals than maternal expressed breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1980</LINK>). Mothers who feed their infants directly from the breast may also express breast milk and give at least some fortified feeds via a bottle, cup, or feeding tube. However, concern exists that this "medicalisation" of infant feeding might alter the maternal perception that breast milk is the preferred nutrition for her infant and interfere with the continuation of exclusive breast milk feeding.</P>
<P>Another putative disadvantage of multinutrient fortification of breast milk is that increasing the nutrient density and osmolarity of breast milk might interfere with gastric emptying and intestinal peristalsis, resulting in feed intolerance, vomiting or diarrhoea. Observational studies have provided conflicting evidence on these potential adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ewer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClure-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 1996</LINK>). The Cochrane review of multinutrient fortification of human milk for preterm infants prior to hospital discharge did not find any evidence of a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects in infants who received fortified milk (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004a</LINK>). There is also concern that excessive protein supplementation may cause metabolic stresses resulting in acidosis or elevated blood urea levels. However, the Cochrane reviews of multinutrient fortification and of protein supplementation of human milk for preterm infants prior to hospital discharge did not find evidence that blood urea rose to levels outwith normal reference ranges (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004b</LINK>). Finally, concern exists that rapid catch-up growth during early infancy may have metabolic programming effects that increase the long-term risk of overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Singhal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhal 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Singhal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhal 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Singhal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhal 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-13 16:57:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In theory, feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with milk enriched with extra energy, protein, minerals and vitamins may be expected to promote more rapid catch-up growth. Higher levels of nutritional input during this period may be especially important for infants who are not able to consume ad libitum quantities of milk directly from the breast, who have slow growth, or who have on-going additional nutritional and metabolic requirements, for example, due to chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2011</LINK>). However, if preterm infants are fed in response to hunger and satiation cues (ad libitum or demand), they may adjust their volume of intake depending upon the energy-density of the milk and so consume less nutrient-fortified milk than if fed with unfortified breast milk. Consequently, infants fed ad libitum with nutrient-fortified milk may not receive any more nutrients than infants who receive unfortified breast milk.</P>
<P>Furthermore, concern exists that catch-up growth with accelerated weight gain and crossing of body mass index (BMI) percentiles might be associated with altered fat distribution and related &#8216;programmed&#8217; metabolic consequences that may increase the risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Euser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Euser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2008</LINK>). However, any effects of nutritional interventions in early infancy on long-term health consequences are likely to be much smaller than those of other environmental or genetic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-14 10:19:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uncertainty exists about the balance between the putative benefits and harms of multinutrient fortification of breast milk for preterm infants following hospital discharge. Since this intervention has the potential to affect several major outcomes, an attempt to detect, appraise, and synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Multinutrient fortification</HEADING>
<P>Supplementation of human breast milk with more than one nutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate, or minerals [calcium and/or phosphate]), versus feeding with unsupplemented human milk. Supplementation with electrolytes, iron, vitamins, or trace minerals in addition to only one of the above nutrients was not classified as multinutrient fortification for the purposes of this review. Restrictions to the pre-discharge feeding regimens were not prespecified. The intervention could have begun up to one week prior to planned discharge from hospital. Trials that randomly assigned infants to begin the study feed more than one week prior to hospital discharge (and then continued the intervention after hospital discharge) were not included in this review. Eligible studies should have planned to allocate the trial intervention for a sufficient period (at least two weeks) to allow measurable effects on growth. Infants in the comparison groups within each study should have received similar care other than the level of fortification of breast milk. For example, there should not be any within-study differences in the prescription of target levels of volume of intake, or advice or support for demand feeding.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-13 17:01:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analyses of growth outcomes contained substantial statistical heterogeneity and need to be interpreted cautiously. In each case <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2008</LINK> found a larger (and statistically significant) mean difference than <LINK REF="STD-Zachariassen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zachariassen 2011</LINK>. The participants in the trials were similar (&lt; 33 weeks gestation at birth, breast-fed at discharge). The overall target level of multinutrient fortification was also similar. Both trials intended to provide extra energy, protein and minerals such that infants received total levels of nutrient input comparable to infants receiving commercially-available "post-discharge formula" (72 kCal to 74 kCal and about 1.6 to 1.8 g of protein/100 mL, plus proportionate supplements of minerals, vitamins, and trace elements). The trials differed slightly in the mechanics of delivering the multinutrient fortifier. In <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2008</LINK>, infants received fortifier in about half of their daily intake of breast milk whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Zachariassen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zachariassen 2011</LINK> the fortifier was given once daily mixed in 20 mL to 50 mL of milk. In both trials the remaining feeds were either taken directly from the breast or as unfortified expressed breast milk ad libitum.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether the slightly different methods of providing fortifier had different impacts on the infants' responses to the energy density of their feeds, in particular whether infants titrated overall volume of intake differently depending on whether they received fortifier in half their feeds or in a once daily feed. <LINK REF="STD-Zachariassen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zachariassen 2011</LINK> did not report any data on overall levels of nutrient intake in trial participants. However, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2008</LINK> reported that the estimated total volume of milk consumed differed between the groups. At the end of the 12 weeks intervention period, infants in the intervention group consumed a mean daily volume of 111 mL/kg compared with 134 mL/kg in the control group. Consequently, the intervention group did not receive substantially different amounts of energy (79 versus 87 kCal/kg/day in the control group) or protein (1.9 versus 1.7 g/kg/day). However, infants in the intervention group received statistically significantly more calcium (11.9 versus 4.7 mmol/kg/day) and phosphorous (8.7 versus 3.8 mmol/kg/day) than control infants. Similarly, intake of vitamin D was higher in the intervention group (567 versus 380 IU/kg/day at 12 weeks).</P>
<P>These differences in mineral and vitamin D intake in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2008</LINK> are possible explanations for the detection of higher whole body bone mineral content in the intervention group maintained until 12 months post term. Bone density and estimated total and percentage fat mass at 12 months were not statistically significantly different suggesting that a higher rate of skeletal growth may be the most important cause of the differences in weight, length and head circumference between the groups. These findings are consistent with data from observational studies that compared preterm infants fed with unfortified breast milk versus formula milk following hospital discharge. These studies found higher levels of bone mineralisation in the formula-fed group suggesting that breast milk mineral or vitamin content may be rate limiting with regard to skeletal growth during early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abrams-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 1988</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-13 16:52:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although small, the trials were generally of good methodological quality with adequate measures to conceal random allocation and near-complete follow-up assessment during the intervention period. Blinding of parents and caregivers was not possible given the nature of the intervention. This is not likely to be a source of bias in growth assessments. However, knowledge of the intervention group may have affected caregivers' or mothers' perceptions and views of feeding and may have influenced decisions on whether to give any formula as a supplement to (or instead of) breast feeding. The trials did not find evidence that multinutrient fortification affected the duration of breast feeding. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2008</LINK> did not find a difference in the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at the end of the intervention period. In part, this finding may be due to the provision of intensive lactation support from the study co-ordinator for both groups during the trial period. Whether breast feeding rates can be maintained in the absence of intensive support remains to be determined. <LINK REF="STD-Zachariassen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zachariassen 2011</LINK> did not report he proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at the end of the intervention period. However, this trial did detect a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of intervention group infants receiving exclusive breast milk feeding at four months post term.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-13 17:01:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane review of trials of nutrient-enriched formula versus standard term formula (which contains about the same level of energy, protein and other nutrients as human breast milk) for feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge did not find an effect on growth rates during infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2012</LINK>). This review also found evidence that infants fed ad libitum infants reduce their volume of intake when the energy content of the milk is higher. Consequently, infants fed ad libitum with nutrient-enriched formula milk generally receive similar levels of calories and only slightly more protein and minerals than infants who receive standard term formula. Therefore, the lack of an effect on growth may be due to the differential in bone mineral or vitamin levels of intake being less marked than in the comparison of multinutrient fortified and unfortified breast milk. Given these findings, it is important that future studies attempt to determine whether bone mineral (and/or vitamin D) supplementation has a similar effect on catch-up growth rates as multinutrient fortification (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Given the potential for post-discharge nutrient fortification of breast milk to affect growth and development in preterm infants, this intervention merits further assessment. Further work is also needed to determine which nutrient groups confer the most important benefits to growth and development. Since fortifying breast milk for infants fed directly from the breast is logistically difficult (and has the potential to interfere with breast feeding), it is important to determine if mothers would support a trial of this intervention. It may be that a trial should first focus on infants who are not able to consume ad libitum quantities of milk directly from the breast, who have low rates of in hospital growth, or who have on-going additional metabolic requirements, for example, due to chronic lung disease.</P>

<P>Aim with fortification of half of the daily human milk intake was to provide milk with an overall average calorie content of 74 kcal/100 mL and protein content of 1.8 g/100 mL; that is, about the same nutrient density as commercially-available "post-discharge" formula</P>
<P>Infants in the intervention group did receive about 50% fortified feeds as planned. Infants in the control group received about 8% fortified feeds at each data collection point</P>
<P>The investigators estimated that "energy intakes did not differ between the groups, suggesting human milk-fed infants are able to compensate to some degree for the energy and/or nutrient density of their feeding."</P>
