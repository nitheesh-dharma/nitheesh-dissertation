<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 12:13:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin is the current standard for basal insulin in the blood glucose lowering therapy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mode of action of this insulin is highly variable, which may be the cause for the difficulties some people with diabetes have to achieve current goals for long-term metabolic control. Therefore, new insulins which are thought to show more favourable properties of action have been developed: insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Because of their theoretical advantages, it is thought that treatment with these new insulin analogues might lead to a beneficial effect, for example less hypoglycaemia or a better metabolic control, possibly resulting in higher quality of life and treatment satisfaction less late diabetic complications such as problems with eyes, kidneys or feet and myocardial infarction, stroke or death.<BR/>Although epidemiological studies indicate that high concentrations of blood glucose carry a higher risk for these late complications, evidence for a beneficial effect of glucose-lowering therapy is conflicting. Following from the different results of large clinical trials, interventions seem to carry different substance specific beneficial or adverse effects. As a consequence, conclusions on the effects of different blood glucose lowering interventions on these outcomes can not be drawn from their effect on blood glucose concentration alone.<BR/>Methodological quality of all the studies was rated low ("C"). Eight studies investigated altogether 2293 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Our analysis of the currently available long-term trials comparing long acting insulin analogues with NPH insulin showed that insulin glargine and insulin detemir were almost identically effective compared to NPH insulin in long-term metabolic control (HbA1c). Fewer people experienced symptomatic overall or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes with treatment with either of the two analogues. No conclusive information on late complications or on possible differences in the number of fatalities exists. For insulin glargine one study found a higher rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients treated with insulin glargine, while in another investigation the opposite result was found. It was thus not possible to conclude for certain whether insulin glargine treatment is safe or not. From the retrieved trials it was also not possible to draw firm conclusions on the effects of these new insulins on quality of life or their cost effectiveness. Until long-term data on benefit and risk are available, we suggest a cautious approach to treatment with insulin glargine or insulin detemir.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Despite indications from epidemiological trials that higher blood glucose concentrations are associated with a higher risk for developing micro- and macrovascular complications, evidence for a beneficial effect of antihyperglycaemic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is conflicting. Two large studies, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), did not find a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improvement of metabolic control. The theoretical benefits of newer insulin analogues might result in fewer macrovascular and microvascular events.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of long-term treatment with long-acting insulin analogues (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) compared to NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>and communication with experts in the field as well as insulin producing companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adults with diabetes mellitus type 2 and had a trial duration of at least 24 weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analyses was performed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies comparing insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin and two studies comparing insulin detemir to NPH insulin were identified. In these trials, 1715 patients were randomised to insulin glargine and 578 patients to insulin detemir. Duration of the included trials ranged from 24 to 52 weeks. Metabolic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, and adverse effects did not differ in a clinical relevant way between treatment groups. While no statistically significant difference for severe hypoglycaemia rates was shown in any of the trials, the rate of symptomatic, overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly lower in patients treated with either insulin glargine or detemir. No evidence for a beneficial effect of long-acting analogues on patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, quality of life or costs could be obtained.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Our analysis suggests, if at all only a minor clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin analogues for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with "basal" insulin regarding symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Until long-term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious approach to therapy with insulin glargine or detemir.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:53:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disorder characterised by relative insulin deficiency resulting from a reduced sensitivity of tissues to insulin or an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells or both. This in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Even though epidemiological investigations indicate that higher blood glucose concentrations are associated with a higher risk for developing micro- and macrovascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1998</LINK>), evidence for a beneficial effect of antihyperglycaemic therapy is conflicting. In the past, investigations of different pharmacological interventions showed results from a marked risk reduction of microvascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Ohkubo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohkubo 1995</LINK>), a reduction of macrovascular risk without a difference in blood glucose concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 34 1998</LINK>) to a statistically non significant (<LINK REF="REF-Abraira-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraira 1997</LINK>) and even statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 34 1998</LINK>) risk increase for macrovascular complications. Following from these results, it has to be assumed that the different interventions carry different substance specific beneficial or adverse effects. As a consequence, firm conclusions on the effect of interventions on patient-relevant outcomes can not be drawn from the effect of these interventions on blood glucose concentration alone.</P>
<P>Pharmacological anti-hyperglycaemic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be done either by different oral agents or insulin. Insulin in itself is a group of heterogeneous preparations clinically differentiated by their course of action over time.<BR/>While short-acting insulin is used to mimic the response of endogenous insulin to food intake and to correct pre- or between-meal hyperglycaemia (bolus insulin), intermediate and long-acting insulin is primarily used to provide a continuous supply of small amounts of insulin, independent of food intake, over a longer period of time to regulate lipolysis and the output of hepatic glucose (basal insulin). long-acting insulin preparations are obtained by crystallisation with either protamine (NPH type) or zinc (Lente type). Treatment with these basal insulins however does show some drawbacks. Achieving lower blood glucose levels carries an increased risk for hypoglycaemia. Because NPH, the most widely used basal insulin, is associated with a pronounced insulin peak following injection and variable absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2000</LINK>), targeting for lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is often difficult and leads to an increased rate of hypoglycaemic events.<BR/>In an effort to provide insulin with a more physiological time course of action to patients with diabetes mellitus, so called insulin analogues have been developed. Insulin analogues are insulin-like molecules, engineered on the basis of the human insulin molecular structure by changing the amino acid sequence and the physiochemical properties. Two such long-acting insulin analogues, insulin detemir (Levemir®) and insulin glargine (Lantus®) are currently available on the market.</P>
<P>Based on the altered time-action profiles of these insulin analogues, different possible advantages in the therapy of diabetic patients were suggested. For instance it was proposed that a lower HbA1c could be achieved with a simultaneous lower risk of hypoglycaemia due to the longer action (lower fasting plasma glucose) and the less pronounced peak (less hypoglycaemia especially during the night). It was also hypothesised that use of Insulin glargine or detemir could improve the patient's quality of life and treatment satisfaction.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Comparing human insulin with insulin analogues has shown a higher mitogenic potency and IGF binding affinity for some representatives of the group of insulin analogues in in-vitro and animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurtzhals-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzhals 2000</LINK>). These effects differ among the individual insulin analogues and results provided from these studies cannot clarify the relevance for patients with diabetes mellitus. The American and the European pharmaceutical registration agencies FDA and EMEA (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2005</LINK>) have commented on the mitogenic and carcinogenic potency of long-acting insulin analogues and conclude that the detrimental effects seems to be low. However, it must be noted that the clinical relevance for patients remains unknown.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Insulin glargine is produced by substituting glycine for asparagine at position 21 of the A-region of the insulin molecule and the addition of two arginine molecules at position B30. This leads to a shift of the isoelectric point toward a neutral pH, resulting in a molecule which is less soluble at the injection site and forms an amorphous precipitate in the subcutaneous tissue which is gradually absorbed. From this depot insulin molecules are slowly released. Metabolic activity of insulin glargine has been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to last for 22 (<LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2000</LINK>) and 30 (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 2000</LINK>) hours and to have no peak (<LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2000</LINK>). Different from this time course of action, NPH insulin, currently the most widely used basal-insulin, reaches a peak between four and eight hours with a duration of action of 12 to 14 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2000</LINK>). Variation among study participants in the rates of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycaemia after injection has also been found to be lower with insulin glargine than with both NPH and zinc insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Lepore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepore 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Compared to human insulin, the amino acid threonin at position 30 of the B-region has been omitted and a fatty acid acylated to lysin at position B 29 in insulin detemir. These modifications lead to a self association at the injection site and allow insulin detemir to reversibly bind to the fatty acid binding sites of albumin. Both of these mechanisms seem to be responsible for the slow absorption from the subcutaneous tissue and thus the protracted action of this insulin analogue (<LINK REF="REF-Havelund-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havelund 2004</LINK>). Also, euglycaemic clamp studies in type 1 diabetic patients showed a lower degree of intra patient variability of action compared with NPH insulin and insulin glargine (<LINK REF="REF-Heise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heise 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Several publications have evaluated the clinical efficacy of insulin glargine and insulin detemir in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Also, various reviews on this subject have been conducted. These reviews considered either only glargine (<LINK REF="REF-CCOHTA-Glargine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCOHTA Glargine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">National 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 2005</LINK>) or insulin detemir (<LINK REF="REF-CCOHTA-Detemir-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCOHTA Detemir 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2004</LINK>) or were published before new studies on these new insulin analogues became available.</P>
<P>While from their pharmacokinetic profile, long-acting insulin analogues appear to be an improvement in the insulin therapy of patients with diabetes mellitus, their superiority in the clinical setting has still to be proven. The aim of this work is to systematically review the clinical efficacy and safety of insulin glargine and detemir in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>

Our data extraction form was headed by the identification of the trial, the name of the first author, the year in which the trial was first published and the quality assessment criteria. The following data were extracted, checked and recorded:</P>
<P>1. General Information<BR/>The general information included the publication status (published or unpublished), if it was a duplicate publication, the sponsor of the trial (specified, known or unknown), the language of publication, the country of publication, the geographical area (urban or rural) and the setting where the trial was carried out (hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, general practice).</P>
<P>2. Methods Section<BR/>The information about the methods summarised the characteristics of the trial, the characteristics of participants, the characteristics of interventions and the outcome measures used and reported in the publication.</P>
<P>2.1. Characteristics of the trial<BR/>The reported items included the design and duration of the trial, randomisation (and method), allocation concealment (and method), blinding (patients, people administering treatment, outcome assessors) and the check of blinding.</P>
<P>2.2. Characteristics of participants<BR/>Information about the participants included the number of participants in each group, how the participants were selected (random, convenience), the exclusion criteria used and the general characteristics (e.g. age, gender, nationality, ethnicity). Disease related information concerning duration of diabetes and late complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and foot complications was extracted. The similarity of groups at baseline was checked as well as reports about withdrawals and losses to follow-up (reasons / description). If subgroup analysis was done, the reported reasons and the method were noted.</P>
<P>2.3. Characteristics of interventions<BR/>The relevant information to extract were the time of intervention, the length of follow-up (in months), the types of insulin (long-acting analogues versus NPH), the dose and route of administration and the administration schedule.</P>
<P>2.4. Characteristics of outcome measures<BR/>The measures mentioned in the outcome section and any other outcomes measured in the study were reported.</P>

<P>Trials fulfilling the review inclusion criteria were assessed independently by two authors to evaluate methodological quality. Interrater agreement was calculated using the kappa-statistic (randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding). Again, any differences in opinion were resolved by discussion with a third author. Assessment for methodological quality was done using a modification of the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>)<I> </I>and the criteria of Jadad and Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and was made based on the following criteria:</P>
<P>(1) Minimisation of selection bias: - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? - b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of performance bias: - a) were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of attrition bias: - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? - b) was analysis done by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) Minimisation of detection bias: - a) were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into the following three categories as set forth by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>):<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they meet the criteria A, B or C according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1998</LINK>) (see also sensitivity analysis below).

<P>For the outcome percentage of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), the change between baseline and endpoint was used for the comparison between the two groups. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated using a random-effects model for the meta-analysis. In some studies the mean change and its variance for each group were presented in the published report of the trial. In other cases where these estimates were not reported, we had to calculate appropriate variances, if possible, from other statistics presented. We also took a second approach to assess the robustness of the results. We calculated a pooled estimate of the variance of change between baseline and endpoint from trials for which the correctly calculated values were reported.<BR/>Furthermore, we looked at patients with at least one episode of (severe, nocturnal, symptomatic and overall) hypoglycaemia. For the meta-analysis of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, the Peto-Odds Ratio was used, since the event rates were low. In all other cases a random-effects meta-analysis of the relative risk was performed.</P>

Two investigations (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>) compared the percentage of patients achieving a HbA1c equal to or less than 7.5% and one (<LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2006</LINK>) the percentage of patients achieving a HbA1c equal to or less than 7.0% without hypoglycaemia as a secondary outcome (for details see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hypoglycaemia</HEADING>
<P>All studies investigating insulin glargine versus NPH insulin reported data on severe, symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. From the two trials comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin results for severe, overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events were available.<BR/>In all included studies neither the participants nor the caregivers were blinded. Therefore, the reliability of the results revealed is heavily dependent on how much room the definition of hypoglycaemic events in the studies leaves for subjective interpretation or deliberate or non-deliberate exertion of influence. Since symptoms without blood glucose measurements were sufficient for counting an event as hypoglycaemia in all studies, it is not possible to exclude bias for any reported results on hypoglycaemia. This is also true for severe hypoglycaemic events because the criterion of "requirement of assistance from another person" alone is also susceptible to bias.<BR/>The definition of hypoglycaemic events as given in the methods sections or as reported in the different publications are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> alongside with our appraisal of possible bias.<BR/>None of the studies reported on blinded outcome assessment, which would be one method for minimisation of possible detection bias.</P>

<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>) reported frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia as the number or the percentage of patients with events, and could be included in the meta-analysis. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.80; P &lt; 0.0001) in favour of treatment with insulin glargine. The test of heterogeneity gave a P value of 0.23 (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Results from studies not included in the meta-analysis:</HEADING>
<P>The number of patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was statistically significantly lower for patients treated with insulin glargine in the morning compared to patients treated with NPH insulin in the evening in the Fritsche study (<LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>). The other study reporting event rates only (<LINK REF="STD-Riddle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Riddle 2003</LINK>) also found a statistically significant difference in the event rates in favour of insulin glargine. Event rates were four events / patient / year in the glargine group and seven events / patient / year in the NPH group.<BR/>Of the two longer studies, one (<LINK REF="STD-Yki_x002d_J_x00e4_rvinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yki-Järvinen 2006</LINK>) did not report on nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The other of the longer studies (<LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>) reported 12% of patients in the glargine group and 24% of patients in the NPH group affected by nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. The difference was statistically significant, P value 0.0002.</P>
<P>For the subgroup of insulin-naive patients in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>, Yki-Järvinen reports in her paper from 2001 that 10% of patients treated with insulin glargine and 24% of NPH treated patients experienced at least one episode of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The difference in frequency of hypoglycaemia between the two treatment groups was statistically significant, P value 0.0001.<BR/>In a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>), for the subgroup of patients applying NPH insulin once daily a reduction of the proportion of patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycaemia was found for treatment with insulin glargine (15%) compared to NPH therapy (27%) (Fonseca 2004).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detemir versus NPH</HEADING>
<P>Data on mortality were available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>). In this study one patient in the insulin detemir treatment group and no patients in the NPH insulin therapy group died.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cardiovascular morbidity</HEADING>
<P>Not a single trial reported on cardiovascular morbidity, but from personal communication data for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>) investigating the effects of insulin detemir versus NPH insulin became available. Only a very small number of events occurred during this trial. Due to this fact no inferences on possible different effects on cardiovascular morbidity can be drawn from this study. For a detailed listing see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diabetic late complications</HEADING>
<P>There were no reports on diabetic late complications in any of the trials. For two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>) some results on retinopathy could be found in the FDA reports. In one of these investigations (<LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>) 8.4% of patients in the glargine group and 14% of patients in the NPH group who had no retinopathy at baseline developed non-proliferative retinopathy during the study, and 1.8% versus 2.4% in the respective treatment groups developed clinically significant macula oedema. Progression of retinopathy by more than three stages was seen in 5.9% versus 9.1% of patients. Development of clinically significant macula oedema was found to be statistically not significantly more frequent in patients treated with insulin glargine with 11.2% of patients affected in the glargine group and 6.5% of patients in the NPH group, P = 0.1. For this outcome there was a marked difference between patients without pre-treatment with insulin and insulin pre-treated patients. While in the former group glargine therapy resulted in a higher rate of macula oedema with 14% affected versus 4% in the NPH group, the opposite was found in the subgroup of patients already treated with insulin before the study: 1.9% versus 12.7%. Results in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>), according to the FDA report, showed a statistically significant higher rate of progression of retinopathy by three or more stages in patients treated with glargine (7.5%) than in patients treated with NPH insulin (2.7%); P = 0.028.<BR/>For one study comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>), results on diabetic late complications were available through personal communication with the author. But because of the short duration of the trial only a very few events occurred, making it impossible to draw any conclusions from results of this study. A detailed listing of events is presented in <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>No trial reported results on quality of life. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>) reported results on treatment satisfaction with the Diabetes Treatment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQc). In this investigation a statistically significant more pronounced improvement of mean scores of treatment satisfaction was reported for treatment with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin. While the DTSQc version measures change, the publication reports baseline and end of study values for the status version of the DTSQ only.</P>

<P>For details see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.<BR/>Some information on adverse events could be derived from all studies, even though reporting on adverse events was limited.<BR/>Due to the differences in duration of follow-up and reporting of adverse events or lack of data, a meta-analysis was not performed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Glargine versus NPH</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yki_x002d_J_x00e4_rvinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yki-Järvinen 2006</LINK>) presented data concerning the overall number of patients with events or the number of events. In all these studies numbers for adverse events were comparable for all treatment arms. Formal statistical testing was not reported in any of the studies.<BR/>Results for serious adverse events were reported only in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yki_x002d_J_x00e4_rvinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yki-Järvinen 2006</LINK>) and adverse events possibly related to study medication in four (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yki_x002d_J_x00e4_rvinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yki-Järvinen 2006</LINK>). No important differences were found for these events.<BR/>The number of patients withdrawing due to adverse events was reported in another six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riddle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Riddle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yki_x002d_J_x00e4_rvinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yki-Järvinen 2006</LINK>).

The number of patients who withdrew from the study because of adverse events was higher in the insulin detemir group. Numbers of affected patients in the two latter comparisons are very small. No formal statistical tests were presented. Also, in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2006</LINK>) the authors state that no difference in frequency of adverse events or the number of patients who withdrew because of adverse events was found between the treatment groups, but no numbers or formal statistics were reported.<BR/>Both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2006</LINK>) found that patients under treatment with insulin detemir gained statistically significant less weight than patients with NPH therapy. The difference was -0.8 kg in one (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>) and -1.6 kg in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2006</LINK>) trial.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>In all studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Riddle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Riddle 2003</LINK>) the number of patients experiencing severe hypoglycaemic events was lower in the insulin glargine group. Since differences in the design of the trials or the definition of severe hypoglycaemia are not a likely explanation and because numbers of affected patients were very small, a chance result seems to be the most plausible cause for the different results. Heterogeneity of results was also found for the frequency of severe hypoglycaemic events in the trials comparing insulin detemir and NPH insulin. While the difference in co-medication pre-meal insulin aspart (<LINK REF="STD-Haak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haak 2005</LINK>) or OADs (<LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2006</LINK>) could be a possible explanation for this finding, it seems more likely to be caused by a chance result due to the very small numbers of affected patients.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was also found for the magnitude of the reduction of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Compared to insulin glargine in the evening in combination with a sulfonylureas in the morning (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; Fritsche B 2003), the treatment with glargine combined with premeal short-acting insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>) resulted in a lower reduction of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. This difference is likely due to the additional premeal insulin leading to a higher chance for hypoglycaemia.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was also detected in the results concerning the differences of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients treated with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin. All studies included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fritsche 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>) found a statistically significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the treatment with insulin glargine. The amount of this reduction was lowest in the study combining insulin glargine with short-acting premeal insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2001</LINK>). The additional effect of evening premeal insulin might be the reason for a higher rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in this study.</P>

Also, because all publications were in the English language and not significantly different in size, sensitivity analyses were not done for these items. The source of funding was commercial in five studies comparing insulin glargine to NPH insulin and unknown for one study.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 12:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis included eight studies comparing the effects of long-acting insulin analogues to NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies investigated insulin glargine and two insulin detemir.</P>
<P>No superiority in HbA1c was observed for insulin glargine. For insulin detemir the meta-analysis yielded a statistically significant but clinically unimportant superiority of NPH insulin in metabolic control. Symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events were lower in patients treated with insulin glargine than in patients with NPH therapy. Also, for insulin detemir the two included studies found a lower number of patients experiencing overall or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes in the insulin detemir treatment groups.<BR/>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the included studies allowed only a cautious interpretation of the results. Because only a small percentage of authors answered our request for additional information as yet, study quality assessment could not be substantially improved. Since personal correspondence with authors and companies is an ongoing process, any future information from these sources will be incorporated in future updates.</P>
<P>No study designed to investigate possible long-term effects was found. Therefore, it remains unclear if and to what extent the treatment with long-acting insulin analogues will affect the development and progression of microvascular and macrovascular events compared to results obtained with NPH insulin. Since the differences in overall effects on metabolic control were only small for insulin glargine and NPH and even disadvantageous for insulin detemir, no important improvements in the development of microvascular late complications would be expected from treatment with long-acting insulin analogues.</P>
<P>As for the advantages found in the rate of severe hypoglycaemic events some caution is warranted. No statistically significant advantage was found for therapy with insulin glargine or detemir. Also, interpretation of the results of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia is difficult due to bias-prone definitions. Patients may inappropriately deny severe hypoglycaemia and in this context "third party help" is a soft and variable description of severity. More robust definitions as "injection of glucose or glucagon by another person" may result in more reliable data (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_hlhauser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mühlhauser 1998</LINK>). In all studies the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia was very low, making it unlikely to see an important clinical effect for the different treatments.<BR/>
<BR/>Even though the meta-analysis found a consistent reduction in symptomatic or overall hypoglycaemic effects for therapy with long-acting insulin analogues, no safe inferences can be drawn from these results because defining hypoglycaemia by symptoms only makes the results prone to bias, especially in open trials with (likely) no blinded outcome assessment.</P>
<P>The advantage of insulin glargine and detemir could be a lowering of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and treatment with basal insulin. But again, bias cannot be ruled out and thus makes the interpretation of the results difficult.</P>
<P>No trial reported data on quality of life. One trial reported data on treatment satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Eliaschewitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eliaschewitz 2006</LINK>) and reported a more pronounced improvement in therapy satisfaction in patients treated with insulin glargine. The interpretation of the clinical importance of this result is hindered by the fact that baseline and end of trial values are reported even though the trialists claim a statistically significant improvement in the change of treatment satisfaction. Additionally, the reporting of this outcome was poor and therefore the assessment of the quality of this outcome was not possible.</P>
<P>Owing to the maximum observation period of 12 months, this review cannot provide any further guidance on potential adverse properties, such as mitogenic effects or progression of microvascular complications under treatment with long-acting insulin analogues. (For insulin glargine one study found a higher rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients treated with insulin glargine, while in another investigation the opposite result was found.)</P>
<P>Since the mean age of patients in the included studies ranged from 55 to 62 years, no information on possible differences of the effects of the different insulins in old or in young patients, a growing group among patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, can be derived from the studies at hand.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our analysis suggests,if at all only a minor clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin analogues for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with "basal" insulin regarding symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Until long-term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious approach to therapy with insulin glargine or detemir.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>For safety purposes and judgment on the efficacy of long-acting insulin analogues in terms of diabetic late complications, we need a long-term follow-up of larger numbers of patients who use these insulins. Studies including young and old patients should be conducted. We also suggest a more uniform and more rigorous reporting of results from upcoming trials to warrant a better comparison and pooling of data and to enable safer inferences from these results.</P>

<P>Page 1: The general statement "evidence for the beneficial effect of antihyperglycemic therapy is conflicting" is out of date. It is generally accepted that microvascular complications are reduced by effective glycaemic control in diabetes type 2, and there is increasing evidence for reduction of macrovascular complications if glycaemic control is established early in the course of the disease (published type 1 diabetes, ongoing large clinical studies in type 2 diabetes). There is no evidence "that different interventions carry different substance specific beneficial or adverse effects". Establishing glycaemic control in diabetes type 2 is the essential element of preventing microvascular and macrovascular complications [by early insulin therapy, in suitable clinical conditions by oral antihyperglycemic agents, and by combination treament]. The substance specific beneficial or adverse effects of the two classes of compounds (insulins versus oral antidiabetic drugs, OAD) are entirely different. Within the pharmacological group of insulins, differences are related more to the dosage form (immediate acting insulin or intermediate acting insulin) than to the specific substances (animal insulins, human insulin or insulin analogues).<BR/>The statement "firm conclusions on the effect of interventions on patient relevant outcomes cannot be drawn from the effect.... on blood glucose concentrations alone" is ambiguous because treatment to glycaemic targets is the primary objective in type 2 diabetes, the effect of achieving glycaemic control on microvascular complications is firmly established.<BR/>The statement "insulin in itself is a group of heterogeneous preparations" needs to be changed to "the insulin drug substance is used in a number of presentations of different duration of action".</P>
<P>Page 2: It is useful to extend the definition of insulin analogues "changing the amino acid sequence, and the physicochemical properties", because the essential element is delayed absorption due to the physicochemical change.<BR/>The definition of insulin glargine needs to iinclude "which is less soluble at the injection site, and forms an amorphous precipitate in the subcutaneous tissue which is gradually absorbed (Sandow et al 2003)". Glargine does not form crystals or microprecipitates as quoted in outdated reviews.<BR/>The statement in the last paragraph refers to human insulin as well as insulin analogues and can be worded "structural homology of human insulin to insulin like growth factor (IGF-I) has caused concern..." because the findings with high (supraphysiological) doses of human insulin in experimental preclinical studies indicate that human insulin has mitogenic activity which is dose-related, when animals are treated with excessive doses of human insulin may cause effects similar to those of IGF-I [EPAR].<BR/>The references that "IGF-I may affect the progression of retinopathy" need to be updated in view of the clinical consensus that progression of retinopathy is related to the rapid normalisation of glycaemic control, whereas the systemic and local factors involved in progression of retinopathy are not completely resolved. The specific effect of IGF-I in clinical studies (Thrailkill et al 1999 ) on formation of macular edema is not found with insulin analogues.<BR/>The statement "modified insulin analogues have shown a carcinogenic effect in the mammary gland of female rats" is not correct, there is only one fast acting insulin analogue [B10-Asp]-insulin which has shown such an effect and was subsequently used as the comparator for all new insulin analogues. &gt;From the publication of <LINK REF="REF-Kurtzhals-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzhals 2000</LINK> it is evident that all clinically used insulin analogues differ from [B10-Asp]-insulin (which has markedly prolonged residence time on the insulin receptor) by a (rate of dissociation which is similar to human insulin or even shorter. It cannot be justified to quote the evidence for the current insulin analogues in this rudimentary form. No preclinical evidence has been brought forward for the "potentially adverse properties of insulin analogues", on the contrary extensive clinical testing and post-marketing surveillance reporting has shown no evidence for either increased mitogenic efficacy in patients, or for progression of retinopathy and related events (retinal bleeding).<BR/>The proposed aim of the Cochrane review is to review clinical efficacy and safety. In this context, reference to the "increased mitogenic potential" should be discontinued because the scientific evidence has been evaluated by the competent authorities (EMEA and FDA), and periodic safety updates are evaluated which do not provide evidence or support the contentions of "increased mitogenic potential" in the therapeutic dose range used for both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.<BR/>The inclusion criteria for studies with combination therapy should clearly state "long acting analogue combined with other antihyperglycaemic drugs", and should not be limited to combination with one antihyperglycaemic drug, because the clinical study protocols frequently included more than one orally active antihyperglycaemic drug. There are also studies comparing combination treatment (NPH insulin plus OAD vs. long acting insulin analogue alone). Excluding such studies from the evaluation would create unnecessary bias and loss of evidence. The clinical relevance of combination treatment reflects the reality of present-day therapy. Comparing basal insulin therapy alone with combination therapy in RCT-24 studies is important for EBM assessment.<BR/>The statement "only studies reporting on insulin regiments (schemata) with subcutaneous application" should be omitted because the two long acting insulin analogues to be reviewed are approved for subcutaneous application only, both are contraindicated and unsuitable for CSII due to their physicochemical properties.</P>
<P>Page 3: In the primary outcome measure, it is surprising to find hypoglycaemia events first followed by glycaemic control. The clinical evidence is clearly that improving and maintaining glycaemic control is the key objective in type 2 diabetes (as well as in type 1 diabetes). Prevention or a delay of progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications follows from treatment to close hypoglycaemic targets, as defined by IDF, ADA and National Diabetes Societies. The key issue is whether glycaemic control can be achieved to the same extent as by conventional NPH insulin, and whether the risk of hypoglycaemic events can be reduced by new treatment regimens, using long acting insulins alone, combination with orally active antidiabetic drugs (OAD), and early insulinisation.<BR/>For the secondary outcome measure, it is suggested to evaluate first the evidence for reduced microvascular complications. This may be followed by evaluation of reduction of macrovascular complications, for which supporting evidence from studies of "duration of 24 weeks or longer" (Page 2) cannot be expected at the present time, because longer observation periods are clearly required, as is well-established from similar long term observations in diabetes type 1.</P>
<P>References: Concerning the "additional references" on pages 6 and 7 of the protocol, it is suggested to update this reference list considerably because much of the recent evidence for effective treatment of type 2 diabetes and related studies in type 1 diabetes and the effect on microvascular/macrovascular complications needs to be included.<BR/>It is proposed to omit reference to the "increased mitogenicity" arguments, or to include an updated and comprehensive discussion of the topic with relevant contemporary references.

<P>Many thanks for your comments on this important topic.</P>
<P>Regarding the first comment, we will not make any changes because our interpretation of the statement that the "evidence for the beneficial effects of antihyperglycaemic therapy is conflicting" is based on the currently published results of randomised controlled trials dealing with drugs that lower blood glucose.<BR/>According your suggestions, we will extend the definition of insulin analogues and provide a more precise definition of insulin glargine.</P>
<P>Though the content of the paragraph about carcinogenicity and mitogenic potency is correct, we have rephrased it to make it more comprehensive.</P>
<P>Our review will aim to assess advantages or disadvantages of long-acting insulin analogues as compared to NPH insulin. To detect any differences between both treatment arms any additional anti hyperglycaemic agents have to be part of each treatment group.</P>
<P>We do not understand the comment that our statement "only studies reporting on insulin regimens with subcutaneous application" should be omitted because e.g. studies using inhalative insulin as additional treatment in both groups will be excluded as well.</P>
<P>Concerning the criticism of the ranking of our outcome measures, it was the decision reached by consensus of all protocol authors in terms of patient-relevant endpoints.</P>

<TITLE>RESPONSE TO HORVATH et al.</TITLE>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Horvath et al. concluded their review with the following statement "If at all, only a minor clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin analogues (LAIA) for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with "basal" insulin regarding symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Until long-term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious approach to therapy with insulin glargine or detemir."</P>
<P>We believe this interpretation is overly critical of the long-acting analogues, and fails to take into consideration some important points. Defined as a "minor clinical benefit", the consistent finding of reduced risk of hypoglycaemia with LAIA reflects the authors' preconceived bias that contradicts the very essence of the Cochrane reviews, and it disregards the importance of hypoglycaemia in clinical diabetes. Firstly, hypoglycaemia is not a trivial problem from the point of view of many patients and physicians, and is a leading barrier to effective use of insulin. </P>
<P>The widespread use of both glargine and detemir has occurred in part due to the experience, both in studies and in clinical practice, that hypoglycaemia is reduced when they are used instead of human intermediate insulins. However, the authors counter this beneficial effect of LAIA in their discussion, using the argument that there is a possibility of bias because the studies were not blinded. Although lack of blinding is a conventional objection that might have influenced hypoglycaemia reporting, measurements of glucose confirming hypoglycaemic events are quite objective and less likely to be affected by lack of blinding of treatment. In fact, blinding was not possible owing to the cloudy physical characteristics of NPH and the clear nature of the soluble LAIAs that have consistently shown less frequent hypoglycaemic events.</P>
<P>Secondly, with regards to the methodology of the paper, most of the studies selected were equivalence studies or non-inferiority trials performed as required for regulatory approval. Thus, not surprisingly, if the hypothesis that preceded the meta-analysis was to demonstrate HbA1c superiority of LAIAs over NPH, this was not found because it was not the intent, nor was it in concordance with the objective of the majority of the published study data used for the analysis. Moreover, the differences in hypoglycaemia observed between human insulins and insulin analogues are greater as glycaemic control approaches the usual target levels, HbA1c 7.0 or 6.5%. Non-inferiority studies generally do not aim to optimize control, and therefore may minimize this advantage. A statistical analysis of this problem of interpretation has recently been published (Mullins et al, 2007) and is very relevant to the conclusions of the meta-analysis. A leading point is that when rates of hypoglycaemia are adjusted for baseline or achieved HbA1c levels, differences between human insulin and analogues become more apparent. </P>
<P>Thirdly, the authors stated that "no trial reported data on quality of life". We believe this is misleading and inaccurate, as aspects of quality of life, such as treatment satisfaction, have been reported at various congresses with full reports in progress. Data sets would have been fully available from the sponsors had the authors requested them. Their findings are consistent with the study by Eliaschewitz, which is cited in the review.</P>
<P>Finally, the secondary endpoints of the meta-analysis were mortality/cardiovascular morbidity/diabetic late complications. The studies analysed did not aim to investigate these variables and their duration was not long enough to take these into consideration. Even though the authors acknowledge this in their discussion, they still conclude that no important improvements in the development of microvascular complications would be expected from treatment with LAIAs. This is correct because there is no reason to believe that these new insulins should have any intrinsic or direct effect to benefit complications. What it is incorrect is to advise caution in the conclusion when using LAIA. Caution implies by definition "avoiding danger or harm; close attention or vigilance to minimize risk". We think this advice is premature, and the evidence for potential harm is scanty and should not have been given a place in their conclusion. Any strong remarks or recommendations based on theoretical risks of LAIAs should await completion of ongoing outcome studies on retinopathy and cardiovascular parameters, and results fully analyzed and published.</P>
<P>In conclusion, we believe the clinical benefits of LAIA over NPH insulin are more than "minor" in many situations, and that the advice to use LAIAs with "caution" is not warranted and is inappropriate on the basis of existing findings. Long-acting insulin analogues are widely used tools that have facilitated insulin management to achieve glycaemic control more safely and more predictably with significantly less risk of hypoglycaemia, allowing more active self-titration by patients with type 2 diabetes. Ongoing studies will provide more complete answers to the questions about long-term risks and benefits of these agents, and will allow more definitive conclusions. </P>

<P>We thank Drs. Rosenstock, Fritsche and Riddle for their interest in our review and their comments.</P>
<P>We agree that hypoglycaemia is indeed an important clinical problem affecting the wellbeing and treatment satisfaction of patients, and the extent to which blood glucose concentration can be lowered. Indeed, the effectiveness of insulin therapy can only be evaluated by considering HbA1c change and the corresponding number of hypoglycaemic events together. The fact that we considered hypoglycaemia as being of high importance is also reflected by the fact that we chose the "number of overall, severe and nocturnal hypoglycaemia" (along with HbA1c) as our primary endpoint.<BR/>Also it seems that those same considerations were the basis for conducting the non-inferiority trials at hand: with the same efficacy in reducing HbA1c (non-inferiority) an additional benefit of reduced hypoglycaemic events was expected. Since for our review lowering HbA1c was not the sole crucial endpoint, but corresponding hypoglycaemia rates were considered as important, the inclusion of non-inferiority trials does not undermine the conclusions that can be drawn from our results. </P>
<P>At any rate, it is essential that the studies were conducted in such a way, that results could be considered largely as unbiased. Among those items that determine the methodological quality of trials is blinding of patients and caregivers for treatment.<BR/>It is true that blinding was not feasible in the studies comparing insulin glargine or detemir with NPH-insulin. However, the simple fact that patients and caregivers were not blinded, does raise the risk for bias regardless of whether blinding would have been possible or not. Also in a situation where blinding is not possible or feasible, other precautionary measures, such as adequate concealment of allocation, blinding of endpoint assessment or unequivocal definitions of endpoints have to be taken to minimize the chance for bias. In most of the included studies either this was not done or not reported (see also Table 03 "Study quality" and Table 07 "definition of hypoglycaemia in study as reported"). Also, the lack of blinding was not the only item leading us to conclude that methodological quality was insufficient to rule out bias. Thus, from the information which is available to us, we have to conclude that the results are open for bias.</P>
<P>"Quality of life" is a multidimensional construct. While quality of life and health status instruments are measuring the outcomes of treatment, treatment satisfaction instruments assess the level of satisfaction with health status outcomes (Revicki 2008). Differentiating between these two concepts, the published trials did not provide any information on aspects of quality of life. However, we still reported the results on treatment satisfaction.</P>
<P>We also contacted all authors of the included studies, among them Drs. Rosenstock, Riddle and Fritsche, asking for additional information. Not all responded. Among those who did was Dr. Riddle. In his letter he told us, that although he had the information we were asking for, he was not able to disclose them to us, because it was the property of Sanofi-Aventis. We also contacted the producers of long-acting insulin analogues "Sanofi-Aventis" and "Novo Nordisk". In the answering letter from Sanofi Aventis (Dr. Vaur) we were told: "With respect to this request I must unfortunately inform you that our company policy is to not provide any third parties with our confidential information such as, e.g. unpublished information contained in study reports or study databases." We did not receive an answer from Novo Nordisk. In contrast, some authors did provide us with additional data which we incorporated in the review - we also acknowledged this wherever applicable.</P>
<P>For insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus, NPH is an effective, safe substance which has been tested over decades. In such cases where a proven effective therapy is available, the introduction of new substances should only be advised if there is a major improvement in efficacy, or if the new substance is proven both effective and safe. Introducing new substances while safety issues are still unanswered could result in harm to patients, as the examples of rosiglitazone, vioxx and others show. So, our advocacy of a cautious approach to therapy with long-acting insulin analogues at this time is justified. </P>

<P>Even though it was required for patients to be elegible for this trial to be on oral antihyperglycaemic therapy with or without insulin, the authors report that 0.2% of the included patients did not have antihyperglycaemic therapy at baseline. The reported baseline values refer to 289 patient in the glargine group and to 281 patients in the NPH group, i. e. compared with the number of randomised participants, there were 4 fewer patients in each group. Age range of included patients was 34 to 80 years, even though inclusion criteria requiered participants to be 40 to 80 years of age.</P>

<P>ITT population was defined as all persons randomised and treated and having both a pretreatment and on-treatment value. The authors also state that the size of this population was different for each variable but no figures are given for the actual patients included in the different analyses. (Patients randomized and treated - I1: 289 / C1: 281). The ITT population was used to perform analyses of HbA1c, FPG, FBG and 24 hour blood glucose profiles. The safety population included all 570 randomized and treated patients. It remains unclear what parameters (hypoglycaemia) were analysed based on this population. There is no statement concerning sponsorship in the paper by Massi. Yki-Järvinen in her paper on the results for the insulin naive patients informs us that the study was commercially sponsored.</P>

<P>The reported discontinuation rate (I1: 9.0% / C1: 8.2%) is based on the ITT population and does not include patients who were randomised but did not receive study medication. Percentages of discontinuation rate in this table were calculated based on all randomized patients.</P>
