<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Occupational therapy for rheumatoid arthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>
<B>Does occupational therapy help people with rheumatoid arthritis? </B>
<BR/>To answer this question, scientists analysed 38 studies. The studies tested over 1700 people who had rheumatoid arthritis. People were either counseled, trained in skills or trained to move or do daily chores with less pain, taught to protect their joints, given splints, taught to use assistive devices, or had no therapy. Not all studies were high quality but this Cochrane Review provides the best evidence about occupational therapy that we have today.</P>
<P>
<B>What is occupational therapy and how could it help rheumatoid arthritis?</B>
<BR/>Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints of the feet and hands and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat around the joint. People with rheumatoid arthritis can find it difficult to do daily chores such as dressing, cooking, cleaning and working. Occupational therapists can give advice on how to do every day activities with less pain or advice on how to use splints and assistive devices.</P>
<P>
<B>How well does it work?</B>
<BR/>A high quality study showed that people could do daily chores better after having occupational therapy with training, advice and counseling. Two high quality studies showed that people given advice about how to protect their joints could do daily chores better than people with no advice or another type of occupational therapy. But both therapies did not help overall well-being or pain.</P>
<P>Another high quality study showed that people trained to move or do daily activities could move just as well as and with the same amount of pain as people who did not have occupational therapy. The strength of their grip was also improved immediately after wearing a splint. But hand movement was less after wearing a splint</P>
<P>There was not enough information to say whether advice about using assistive devices is helpful.</P>
<P>
<B>What is the bottom line?</B>
<BR/>There is "gold" level evidence that occupational therapy can help people with rheumatoid arthritis to do daily chores such as dressing, cooking and cleaning and with less pain. Benefits are seen with occupational therapy that includes training, advice and counseling and also with advice on joint protection. </P>
<P>Splints can decrease pain and improve the strength of one's grip, but it may decrease hand movement. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-08 14:45:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the physical, personal, familial, social and vocational consequences are extensive. Occupational therapy (OT), with the aim to facilitate task performance and to decrease the consequences of rheumatoid arthritis for daily life activities, is considered to be a cornerstone in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Till now the efficacy of occupational therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis on functional performance and social participation has not been systematically reviewed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether OT interventions (classified as comprehensive therapy, training of motor function, training of skills, instruction on joint protection and energy conservation, counseling, instruction about assistive devices and provision of splints) for rheumatoid arthritis patients improve outcome on functional ability, social participation and/or health related quality of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant full length articles were identified by electronic searches in Medline, Cinahl, Embase, Amed, Scisearch and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal group Specialised Register. The reference list of identified studies and reviews were examined for additional references. Date of last search: December 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Controlled (randomized and non-randomized) and other than controlled studies (OD) addressing OT for RA patients were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 14:45:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials was independently assessed by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A list proposed by Van Tulder et al. () was used to assess the methodological quality. For outcome measures, standardized mean differences were calculated. The results were analysed using a best evidence synthesis based on type of design, methodological quality and the significant findings of outcome and/or process measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-eight out of 58 identified occupational therapy studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Six controlled studies had a high methodological quality. Given the methodological constraints of uncontrolled studies, nine of these studies were judged to be of sufficient methodological quality. The results of the best evidence synthesis shows that there is strong evidence for the efficacy of "instruction on joint protection" (an absolute benefit of 17.5 to 22.5, relative benefit of 100%) and that limited evidence exists for comprehensive occupational therapy in improving functional ability (an absolute benefit of 8.7, relative benefit of 20%). Indicative findings for evidence that "provision of splints" decreases pain are found (absolute benefit of 1.0, relative benefit of 19%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that occupational therapy has a positive effect on functional ability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients show a reduction in physical capacities compared to healthy persons. Symptoms such as pain, fatigue, stiffness and decreased muscle strength cause difficulties with daily activities like grooming and dressing, cooking a meal, cleaning, shopping, work- and leisure activities. The physical, personal, familial, social and vocational consequences of rheumatoid arthritis are extensive. Occupational therapy (OT) is concerned with facilitating people in performing their daily living activities, and in overcoming barriers by maintaining or improving abilities or to compensate for decreased ability in the performance of occupations (<LINK REF="REF-Lindquist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindquist 1999</LINK>). The most important interventions in occupational therapy are training of skills, counseling, education of joint protection skills, prescription of assistive devices and the provision of splints (<LINK REF="REF-Melvin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melvin 1998</LINK>). Advice/instruction in the use of assistive devices, training of self care activities and productivity activities are the three most often chosen interventions by occupational therapists for rheumatoid arthritis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Driessen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driessen 1997</LINK>).<BR/>Till now, the evidence on the effects of occupational therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis on functional performance and social participation has not been reviewed systematically. So far, one narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>) discussed the effectiveness of splinting, joint protection, and provision of aids/equipment for several rheumatic diseases on basis of the results of only a few studies on occupational therapy. One Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Egan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 2003</LINK>) addresses the efficacy of splints and orthosis for RA patients, evaluating only a small part of OT interventions. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published studies evaluating occupational therapy for rheumatoid arthritis</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether OT interventions for RA patients improve outcome on functional ability, social participation and/or health related quality of life.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:00:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies with one of the following designs have been entered in the review.<BR/>1) Randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT): An experiment in which investigators randomly allocate eligible people into treatment and control groups. Cross-over trials were considered as RCTs according to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). <BR/>2) Controlled clinical trial (CCT): an experiment in which eligible people are in a non-randomized way allocated to the treatment and the control groups.<BR/>3) Other than controlled designs (OD): patient series and pre-post studies. Such ODs can only contribute in a limited way to the best evidence synthesis.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies with patients who fulfil a clinical diagnosis (as described by the authors of the studies) of rheumatoid arthritis have been included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In rheumatoid arthritis occupational therapy can include a variety of interventions. OT interventions were either regarded as "comprehensive OT" (when all six intervention categories were part of the evaluated OT treatment) or were classified into six specific intervention categories: 1) training of motor function; 2) training of skills; 3) instruction on joint protection; 4) counseling; 5) advice and instruction in the use of assistive devices; and 6) provision of splints. <BR/>All studies with interventions as above specified according to a group of four experienced occupational therapists and reviewer CHME (see: Methods of the review) were eligible for inclusion in this review. All studies with a multi-disciplinary intervention were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Studies that used one or more of the following outcome measures have been included:</P>
<P>Primary outcome measures: pain, fatigue, functional abilities (including dexterity), physical independence, quality of life (including well-being and depression). Information about the used outcome scales can be found in the clinical relevance tables. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>
</P>
<P>Secondary process measures (process measures are considered to be indicators of a successful treatment): knowledge about disease management, compliance, self-efficacy, range of motion, muscle strength</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-08 14:12:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only full length articles or full written reports have been considered for inclusion in the review. The following procedures were used to identify trials:<BR/>1. A broad computerized search strategy for identifying RCTs, CCTs and OD was used built upon the following components:</P>
<P>a) search strategy for controlled trials (RCTs, CCTs) as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>): see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.<BR/>b) search strategy for OD: see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.<BR/>c) Search strategy for rheumatoid arthritis: see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.<BR/>d) Search strategy for occupational therapy interventions: see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The following databases were searched:<BR/>a) MEDLINE (1966 until December 2002)<BR/>b) CINAHL (1982 until December 2002)<BR/>c) Embase (1974 until December 2002)<BR/>d) SCISEARCH (1974 until December 2002)<BR/>e) Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 4 2002)<BR/>f) The databases of the libraries of medical and rehabilitation literature of two Dutch institutes (NPI / Nivel)<BR/>g) The database of the Rehabilitation and Related Therapies (RRT) Field of the Cochrane Collaboration<BR/>h) The specialized trial's register of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group</P>
<P>The search strategy has been formulated in WinSpirs (Medline, Cinahl) and was adapted by an experienced medical librarian to make it applicable for the other databases.<BR/>2) The same databases were searched to identify reviews about the efficacy of occupational therapy<BR/>3) The reference lists of the identified studies and reviews were scanned.<BR/>4) Authors of papers reporting trials about the efficacy of OT in RA were contacted by mail and asked for any published of unpublished studies relevant for this systematic review. A list with so far identified trials was enclosed.<BR/>5) Authors of abstracts were asked for a full written report.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:00:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selection for inclusion in the review, assessment of the methodological quality and data extraction have been performed in three separate steps. Three reviewers (CHME, EMJS, MAKM) did take part in these procedures. Prior to all three steps assessment procedures were tested in a sample of three articles by two reviewers. A standard form for each step was made.</P>
<P>Selection for inclusion<BR/>Because of the broad search strategy we expected to find a large number of non relevant articles. The procedure for inclusion of the studies was based on the recommendations by Van Tulder et al (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>): The first selection, based on titles and abstracts, was independently performed by two reviewers (EMJS and CHME) considering the criteria for 'type of study', 'type of participants' and 'type of outcome measures'. This first selection could result in inclusion of the study, exclusion of the study, or could be indecisive. Disagreements between the two reviewers was discussed. If the first selection was indecisive or if disagreement persisted, a final decision on inclusion has been based on the full article. The second step for inclusion was independently done by two reviewers (EMJS and MAKM), using full reports and considering the criteria stated above. Disagreements regarding inclusion status has been resolved by discussion. If no consensus was met a third reviewer (CHME) decided. Finally, a group of four occupational therapists and reviewer CHME did assess the criteria for 'types for intervention' and if appropriate classify the type of intervention into one of the six different interventions or combinations of interventions. Consensus has been reached by discussion.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>The variety in study designs included in this systematic review necessitated the use of different quality assessment tools. The methodological quality of RCTs and CCTs was rated by a list recommended by Van Tulder (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>). The list, containing specified criteria proposed by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and Verhagen et al (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>) consists of 11 criteria for internal validity, 6 descriptive criteria and 2 statistical criteria (Appendix 1). One modification was made in the specification of the criterion 'eligibility': the 'condition of interest' (the impairment or disability that indicated referral to occupational therapy) was added as an eligibility criterion, as proposed by Wells (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>). All criteria are scored as yes, no, or unclear. Studies were considered to be of 'high quality' if at least six criteria for internal validity, three descriptive criteria and one statistical criterion were scored positively.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the other designs (ODs) has been rated using an adapted version of the Van Tulder list (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). Some items (concerning randomization, similarity of patient groups, blinding of care provider, blinding of patient) were considered inapplicable to ODs and removed from the list. Some items were reformulated to make them applicable to one patient group (for instance: "were co-interventions avoided or comparable?' was reformulated into "were co-interventions avoided?") or to make the item applicable for the design of the study (for instance: "was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention" was reformulated into: "was the care-provider not involved in the outcome assessment?"). The final list of criteria used in ODs consists of seven criteria for internal validity, four descriptive criteria and two statistical criteria (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). All criteria were scored as yes, no, or unclear. Studies were considered to be of 'sufficient quality' if at least four out of seven criteria for internal validity, two descriptive criteria and one statistical criterion were scored positively.<BR/>The methodological quality of the included trials was independently assessed by two reviewers (EMJS, MAHK). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. If no consensus was met a third reviewer (CHME) decided.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>The following information was systematically extracted by EMJS<BR/>1. Study characteristics: number of participating patients, specified criteria for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, in and exclusion criteria, type of experimental and control interventions, co-interventions, features of interventions (duration, frequency, setting), number of drop-outs.<BR/>2. Patient characteristics: type of disease, sex, age, disease duration, disease severity.<BR/>3. Outcome and process measures assessed immediately after finishing the intervention, within six months follow up and after six or more months follow up:<BR/>Continuous variables: baseline values (mean and standard deviation), standardized mean difference with corresponding 95% confidence interval.<BR/>Dichotomous variables: odds ratio with corresponding 95% confidence interval</P>
<P>Analysis of the results:<BR/>In this review seven different intervention categories were distinguished: 1) Comprehensive OT, 2) training of motor function, 3) training of skills, 4) instruction on joint protection, 5) counseling, 6) advice / instruction assistive devices, and 7) provision of splints. Analyses were performed separately for each intervention category.</P>
<P>The results of each study were plotted, if possible, as point estimates, i.e., odds ratio with corresponding 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence interval for continuous outcomes.</P>
<P>We expected to find too much clinical heterogeneity among the studies with regard to patients (severity of the disease), interventions (duration, frequency and setting) and outcome measures (diversity, presentation of the results) to make quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) appropriate. Instead, we performed a best evidence synthesis by attributing various levels of evidence to the efficacy of OT, taking into account the design of the studies, the methodological quality and the outcome of the original studies. The best-evidence synthesis (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>) is based upon the one proposed by Van Tulder (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>) and was adapted for the purpose of this review.</P>
<P>Additional tables<BR/>Continuous outcomes results are presented in tables showing the absolute benefit and the relative difference in the change from baseline. Absolute benefit is calculated as the improvement in the treatment group less the improvement in the control group, in the original units. Relative difference in the change from baseline is calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean (control group). The relative difference in change is used to provide clinically meaningful information about expected improvement relative to the placebo or untreated group with each intervention. Results from individual trials are presented separately allowing the comparison of the percentage improvement in each trial or combined.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed by attributing different levels of quality to the studies:<BR/>1) results were re-analysed excluding low quality studies.<BR/>2) results were re-analysed considering studies to be of "high quality" if 4 or more criteria of internal validity are met.<BR/>3) results were re-analysed excluding studies not reporting on the ACR criteria for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Arnett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnett 1988</LINK>)</P>
<P>Grading the strength of the evidence<BR/>The common system of grading the strength of scientific evidence for a therapeutic agent that is described in the CMSG module scope and in the Evidence-based Rheumatology BMJ book (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2003</LINK>) was used to rank the evidence included in this systematic review. Four categories are used to rank the evidence from research studies from highest to lowest quality: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. The ranking is included in the synopsis of this review.</P>

One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Feinberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Feinberg 1992</LINK>) reported positive significant results on compliance. Grip strength was assessed with regard to two aspects. The effect on grip strength immediately after provision of the splint was evaluated in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stern-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ter-Schegget-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ter Schegget 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tijhuis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tijhuis 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nordenski_x00f6_ld-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nordenskiöld 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rennie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rennie 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1987</LINK>).

One low quality RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Palchik-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Palchik 1990</LINK>) presented significant results after wearing an anti-boutonniere splint for 6 weeks. The relative difference between groups ranged from -75% to 7% (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). Twelve studies reported on safety side effects. <LINK REF="STD-Callinan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Callinan 1995</LINK> reported that arm and hand functions were not significantly affected by splint wear. <LINK REF="STD-Palchik-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Palchik 1990</LINK> shows that patients wearing silver rings for a boutonniere deformity had more difficulties with active flexion following removal of the splint. <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1996a</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Stern-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1997</LINK>) reported a decrease of grip strength when wearing working splints and patients in the study reported removing the splint when doing activities that required dexterity. <LINK REF="STD-Ter-Schegget-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ter Schegget 2000</LINK> reported that wearing a splint for swan neck deformity did not effect grip strength. <LINK REF="STD-Tijhuis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tijhuis 1998</LINK> reported that a futuro working splint did not interfere with hand function. <LINK REF="STD-Pagnotta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pagnotta 1998</LINK> reports that splint wear hinders dexterity. <LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1982</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1992</LINK>) shows an increase of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms when wearing an air pressure splint. <LINK REF="STD-Agnew-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Agnew 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spoorenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Spoorenberg 1994</LINK> both report restriction of hand movement while wearing splints. <LINK REF="STD-Feinberg-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Feinberg 1981</LINK> reports no changes in rang of motion after splint wear. <LINK REF="STD-Malcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Malcus 1992</LINK> presents a decrease in range of motion after wearing a anti-ulnar deviation splint.<BR/>Thus, there are indicative findings that splints are effective in reducing pain both immediately after provision of the splint and after splinting over a period of time. Also there are indicative findings that splinting has a negative effect on dexterity. Furthermore, indicative findings for a gain in grip strength immediately after provision of the splint have been found.</P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSES<BR/>Three sensitivity analyses were performed to check for the robustness of the outcome of the best evidence syntheses. <BR/>Considering only studies that scored a high or sufficient methodological quality, the outcome of the best evidence syntheses for all interventions, except "provision of splints" are the same as the results presented.

<P>Analysing the results with incorporation of studies with a score of 4 items or more on the internal validity criteria, the outcome of the best evidence synthesis are, for all interventions except "comprehensive OT", similar to the results presented. Within the category "comprehensive OT" the results of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Helewa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Helewa 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kraaimaat-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kraaimaat 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mowat-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mowat 1980</LINK>) instead of one contribute to the best evidence synthesis. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kraaimaat-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kraaimaat 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mowat-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mowat 1980</LINK>) reported no significant results on functional abilities whereas one (<LINK REF="STD-Helewa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Helewa 1991</LINK>) did. As a result the finding of 'limited evidence' changes to 'indicative findings' for the evidence of efficacy of OT on functional ability.</P>

Within the category "instruction of joint protection" one high quality RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hammond-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hammond 2001</LINK>) did not report the ACR criteria.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 14:53:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review the efficacy of several occupational therapy interventions for rheumatoid arthritis was explored. Seven different intervention categories were distinguished. The outcome measures were pain, fatigue, functional ability, and social participation. Process measures such as knowledge about disease management, compliance, self-efficacy, grip strength, and range of motion were also taken into account. This systematic review established limited evidence for the efficacy of comprehensive OT and strong evidence for the efficacy of the intervention "instruction on joint protection" on functional ability. For the intervention "provision of splints" indicative findings for a decrease in pain were demonstrated. Indicative findings for a negative effect of splinting on dexterity were discovered, as were indicative findings for evidence that grip strength increases after provision of splints.</P>
<P>Our results on the intervention category "provision of splints" are a little different from the results found in the Cochrane Review on splints for rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Egan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 2003</LINK>). They conclude insufficient evidence whereas we conclude indicative findings. Our conclusions are partially based on sufficient quality ODs which were not included in the <LINK REF="REF-Egan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 2003</LINK> review.</P>
<P>RCTs/CCTs and studies with other designs (ODs) were included in this review. Sixteen ODs were identified. A distinction was made between ODs with a sufficient methodological quality and ODs that lacked a sufficient methodological quality. Because of the weakness of the internal validity of ODs, sufficient methodological quality ODs could only state 'indicative findings' in the used best evidence synthesis. The incorporation of the outcomes of ODs resulted in indicative findings for a decrease in pain immediately after provision of the splint. Within the other intervention categories, results of ODs did not contribute to the outcome of the best evidence synthesis because RCTs and/or CCTs were available. However, in most categories of interventions the results of ODs supported the findings of RCTs/CCTs. So, in emerging fields of research, like occupational therapy research is, results of studies other than controlled trials may have some value in judging the effectiveness of interventions when there is a lack of RCTs and CCTs.</P>
<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather poor. Only six of the sixteen RCTs had a high methodological quality. No CCTs with a high methodological quality were identified and only half of the sixteen ODs, given the methodological constraints of ODs, were considered of sufficient methodological quality. Bias was possible since most studies did not report on blinding of patients, blinding of care providers and blinded outcome assessors. Since blinding of patients and care providers is rather difficult in allied health interventions, especially the blinding of the outcome assessor is of paramount importance to avert detection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Siemonsma-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siemonsma 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Day-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>The nature of the occupational therapy interventions varied widely, even within intervention categories, large differences in interventions with regard to type of treatment, duration, and setting precluded comparing results. Furthermore, poor data presentation impeded the comparisons of results among studies. Only six RCTs presented sufficient data to compute effect sizes. In future research, special attention should be given to the presentation of study results according international standards (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>). Finally, outcome measures were very heterogeneous: for each outcome and process measure several measurement instruments were used. To overcome this problem international consensus about a 'core set' of outcome measures for the outcome of occupational therapy in rheumatoid arthritis is needed. The first question to be addressed should be which outcomes are most important for occupational therapy. The second question concerns which outcome instruments are most reliable, valid, responsive and easy to obtain.</P>
<P>The power of the studies included in this review was rather poor. To detect a medium effect size of 0.5 (with =0.05, and power at 80%) , the sample size per group needs to be at least 50 (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>). Only three controlled studies had a sample size with 50 or more participants per group (<LINK REF="STD-Hammond-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hammond 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hass-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hass 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Helewa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Helewa 1991</LINK>). The findings of this review could be an underestimation of the real evidence for the efficacy of occupational therapy due to the limited power of the studies. On the other hand, the results of this review could also be an overestimation because of publication bias by unpublished small negative studies.</P>
<P>Several items should be considered in future research about the efficacy of occupational therapy. To improve the methodological quality of studies proper randomization procedures should be performed after baseline assessment with special attention to the concealment of allocation. Another important issue is the blinding of the outcome assessor. Since blinding of patients and care providers is almost impossible for OT interventions, procedures to guarantee the blinding of the outcome assessors are needed to prevent bias. Statistical significant differences are more likely to occur in studies with sufficient power. This means that large groups of rather homogenous participants should be included in trials that compare the experimental intervention with no treatment or, if not possible, with a treatment with a clear contrast. Furthermore, outcome measures should be carefully chosen with regard to the aim of the intervention. Studies in which outcome measures are applied that are relevant and responsive are more likely to result in statistically significant differences between groups.</P>
<P>The inventory of studies in this review reveals important gaps in occupational therapy research. No studies were found for the category "Training of skills" and only two studies were found for the intervention "Instruction / advice assistive devices". This is remarkable because "Training of skills" and "Instruction / advice assistive devices" are very common occupational therapy interventions (3). Another finding is the lack of data on the outcome measure social participation. The ultimate goal of occupational therapy is to restore / maintain full participation in all social activities: outcome measures should reflect this aim.</P>
<P>In conclusion, we found strong evidence for the efficacy of instruction of joint protection on functional ability. Studies that evaluated comprehensive OT showed limited evidence for the effectiveness on functional ability. Studies that evaluated splint interventions reported indicative findings for the effectiveness on pain. These results are encouraging for the occupational therapy practice as an important part in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Also, this review revealed that important fields of occupational therapy, like "training of skills" and "advice in the use of assistive devices", are under researched and should get more attention. On the basis of this review we recommend that further clinical trials are necessary for each category of interventions. In future studies special attention should be given to the design of trials, the use of responsive, reliable and valid outcome measures, the inclusion of a sufficient number of patients to create statistical power and the presentation of trial results according international standards.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review has shown positive effect of comprehensive occupational therapy and instruction on joint protection on the important outcome functional ability. It also revealed an indication of efficacy for splinting on pain and grip strength. Provision of splints may have a decrease of dexterity as a side effect. The reviewers conclude that occupational therapy can help patients with rheumatoid arthritis to overcome problems in performing daily live activities. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A ' core set' of outcome measures for the outcome of occupational therapy, reflecting the ultimate aim to restore or maintain full participation in all social and daily activities, for rheumatoid arthritis patients is needed. To state the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions, research in specific categories such as training of skills and advice/instruction of assistive devices should be extended. More high quality RCTs are needed. </P>
