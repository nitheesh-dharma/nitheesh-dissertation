<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI, cyclosporin and tacrolimus) are an important part of treatment to suppress the immune system to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys. However, CNI can cause high blood pressure and kidney scarring which contribute to worsening of risk factors for heart attack, stroke, and loss of the transplanted organ over time.</P>
<P>There are conflicting data on the results of withdrawing these drugs from kidney transplant recipients; some studies suggest improved kidney function but others report a moderate risk of developing rejection. Because of this uncertainty, we assessed the benefits and harms of CNI withdrawal or tapering in kidney transplant recipients to identify which approach was more beneficial.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
<BR/>We included 83 studies that involved more than 16,000 people in our review. Studies which compared standard dose CNI regimens with withdrawal, tapering or low dose CNI in the post-transplant period were analysed.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
<BR/>Although withdrawing CNI treatment resulted in more rejections in the short term, there was no clear change in transplanted organ failure, death, development of cancer, or infections. Replacing CNI with another group of drugs - the mTOR inhibitors - did not significantly change outcomes, except for fewer cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Lower CNI dose was associated with fewer episodes of kidney transplant rejection and loss, but only in the first year to up to five years after the transplant.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>We found that the long-term outcomes for stopping or gradually reducing CNI therapy were not clear, and that mTOR inhibitors can reduce CMV infections with a higher risk of acute rejection. There were insufficient studies with long term follow-up to clearly determine which treatment is better for people who receive kidney transplants.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:05:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can reduce acute transplant rejection and immediate graft loss but are associated with significant adverse effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity which may contribute to chronic rejection. CNI toxicity has led to numerous studies investigating CNI withdrawal and tapering strategies. Despite this, uncertainty remains about minimisation or withdrawal of CNI.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:06:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of CNI tapering or withdrawal in terms of graft function and loss, incidence of acute rejection episodes, treatment-related side effects (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) and death.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-07 11:52:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 11 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-04-05 14:34:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where drug regimens containing CNI were compared to alternative drug regimens (CNI withdrawal, tapering or low dose) in the post-transplant period were included, without age or dosage restriction.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-04-05 14:35:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:45:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We included 83 studies that involved 16,156 participants. Most were open-label studies; less than 30% of studies reported randomisation method and allocation concealment. Studies were analysed as intent-to-treat in 60% and all pre-specified outcomes were reported in 54 studies. The attrition and reporting bias were unclear in the remainder of the studies as factors used to judge bias were reported inconsistently. We also noted that 50% (47 studies) of studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
<P>We classified studies into four groups: CNI withdrawal or avoidance with or without substitution with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-I); and low dose CNI with or without mTOR-I. The withdrawal groups were further stratified as avoidance and withdrawal subgroups for major outcomes.</P>
<P>CNI withdrawal may lead to rejection (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.12; moderate certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24; moderate certainty), and probably slightly reduces graft loss (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; low quality evidence). Hypertension was probably reduced in the CNI withdrawal group (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95; low certainty), while CNI withdrawal may make little or no difference to malignancy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30; low certainty), and probably makes little or no difference to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.45; low certainty)</P>
<P>CNI avoidance may result in increased acute rejection (RR 2.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.49; low certainty) but little or no difference in graft loss (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16; low certainty). Late CNI withdrawal increased acute rejection (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.48; moderate certainty) but probably reduced graft loss (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, low certainty).</P>
<P>Results were similar when CNI avoidance or withdrawal was combined with the introduction of mTOR-I; acute rejection was probably increased (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.78; moderate certainty) and there was probably little or no difference in death (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.36, moderate certainty). mTOR-I substitution may make little or no difference to graft loss (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19; low certainty), probably makes little of no difference to hypertension (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; moderate), and probably reduced the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; moderate certainty) and malignancy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00; low certainty). Lymphoceles were increased with mTOR-I substitution (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.21; low certainty).</P>
<P>Low dose CNI combined with mTOR-I probably increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (MD 6.24 mL/min, 95% CI 3.28 to 9.119; moderate certainty), reduced graft loss (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; moderate certainty), and made little or no difference to acute rejection (RR 1.13 ; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; moderate certainty). Hypertension was decreased (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.20; low certainty) as was CMV (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.06; low certainty). Low dose CNI plus mTOR-I makes probably makes little of no difference to malignancy (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.53; low certainty) and may make little of no difference to death (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.90; moderate certainty).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-07 12:04:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CNI avoidance increased acute rejection and CNI withdrawal increases acute rejection but reduced graft loss at least over the short-term. Low dose CNI with induction regimens reduced acute rejection and graft loss with no major adverse events, also in the short-term. The use of mTOR-I reduced CMV infections but increased the risk of acute rejection. These conclusions must be tempered by the lack of long-term data in most of the studies, particularly with regards to chronic antibody-mediated rejection, and the suboptimal methodological quality of the included studies.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Standard immunosuppressive protocols to prevent acute graft rejection in kidney transplantation involve three major groups of drugs - calcineurin inhibitor(s) (CNI), antimetabolites and steroids. CNI have been an important part of primary immunosuppression therapy together with adjunctive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA) and steroids in kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>CNI inhibit the calcium-dependent enzyme serine phosphatase calcineurin. This process prevents the dephosphorylation of nuclear factors of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT), which is essential for translocation into the nucleus leading to reduced activation of cytokine genes for interleukin-2 (IL2) production. Cyclosporin (CsA) and tacrolimus (TAC) are CNI used for kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Melk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melk 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>CNI have dramatically reduced the incidence of acute transplant rejection and decreased early graft loss (<LINK REF="REF-Ahsan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahsan 2001</LINK>). However, CNI have been associated with significant adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1996</LINK>) causing decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and a significant contribution to chronic allograft nephropathy. These effects could lead to subsequent graft loss and contribute directly or indirectly to patient morbidity and mortality by affecting the cardiovascular risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1996</LINK>). The immunological causes of graft loss have to be however considered. The potential risks of CNI use should be balanced against the risks of acute rejection and chronic antibody-mediated rejection, especially in patients with a high immunological risk.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:10:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The significant toxicity profile of CNI have prompted many studies investigating CNI withdrawal and tapering strategies. However, some highlighted an increase in acute rejection following withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Abramowicz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abramowicz 2002</LINK>) and others showed no effect on graft survival and a short term improvement in creatinine values (<LINK REF="REF-Gonwa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonwa 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Despite the large number of studies conducted, uncertainty remains about tapering or withdrawing CNI. These strategies must be balanced with the significant benefits conferred by CNI in preventing early graft rejection. In the absence of a clear clinical consensus, this review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of CNI withdrawal or tapering for kidney transplant recipients.</P>

<P>Subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. interventions and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age and renal pathology. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to prior agent(s) used, the agent (CsA/TAC) and duration of therapy prior to withdrawal or tapering. Adverse effects are tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, as they are likely to be different for the various agents used.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>We presented the main results of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of the available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-07 12:08:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review describes CNI withdrawal or tapering classified according to: CNI withdrawal, low dose CNI, CNI withdrawal with mTOR-I substitution and low dose CNI with mTOR-I compared to standard dose CNI regimens. The four groups were further stratified into CNI avoidance and withdrawal studies for major outcomes.</P>
<P>In the CNI withdrawal comparison with standard regimens, there was an increase in both clinical acute rejection and BPAR. GFR was higher in the withdrawal group especially over longer time periods. Death, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, total and CMV infections were not significantly different between the groups. Standard dose CNI regimens were more likely to be associated with hypertension when compared to CNI withdrawal patients. Graft loss was lower in the CNI withdrawal group; however, when stratified for avoidance studies, there was no difference in graft loss between the groups. These protocols (late withdrawal or avoidance) resulted in an increase in acute rejection with no clear benefit in terms of reduced graft loss. There was also no difference in the type of CNI (TAC or CsA) used or steroid-free regimens in causing acute rejection. The beneficial effects of CNI withdrawal in reducing graft loss were lost when studies with long-term outcomes were excluded.</P>
<P>In the low dose CNI comparison with standard dose regimens, there was a reduction in acute rejection, however when studies which administered induction treatment (IL2RA or anti-lymphocyte serum or globulin) were excluded from the analysis, acute rejection was similar in the low dose CNI and standard dose CNI regimens, both in the immediate and late introduction groups. GFR was higher in the low dose CNI group at both one and five years. There were no significant differences in death, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and CMV infection between the groups. Low dose CNI regimens had a marginal reduction in hypertension and total infections. Graft loss was reduced in the low dose CNI regimen, however when stratified for early and late intervention (taper), the effect was limited to the early intervention studies.</P>
<P>In the CNI avoidance or tapering with mTOR-I substitution compared to standard dose CNI regimens, there was no difference in death between the two groups. The mTOR-I substitution regimen however had more acute rejections (clinical and biopsy-proven) and had more hyperlipidaemia. CMV infection and malignancy were significantly lower in the mTOR-I substitution group. GFR was higher in the CNI avoidance with mTOR-I subgroup but not in the late intervention subgroup. There was no difference in other outcomes when stratified for early or late intervention. Overall these protocols (avoidance or tapering) showed no major change compared to CNI alone except for the increase in acute rejection when compared with either CNI (CsA or TAC). The major benefit of mTOR-I substitution is seen in the reduction in malignancies and CMV infections over time.</P>
<P>When low dose CNI was combined with mTOR-I and compared to standard dose CNI regimens, there were no differences in death, graft loss or acute rejection. Adverse events including malignancy were not significantly different between the groups. GFR and SCr at one year favoured the low dose CNI with mTOR-I regimen. However when stratified for early and late intervention there was increased acute rejection in the low dose CNI with mTOR-I regimens.</P>
<P>This review investigated a large number of studies comparing different CNI regimens. Many studies and reports were published in multiple journals at various time points and were presented as abstracts at scientific meetings without acknowledging previous publications. The same studies were also published under different authors and this review combined these reports under a single study and reported outcomes systematically. The methodology was robust and the studies were also assessed for study quality and heterogeneity explored by subgroup and stratified analysis. The review classified interventions into four groups which reduced multiple comparisons due to several different regimens.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:46:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Short time scales of most studies restrict the external validity of this review. Moving away from CNI may have multiple adverse long-term effects that will not be measured by these studies. The studies also do not mention of antibody-mediated rejection and pretransplant donor specific antibodies which could impact on short- and long-term graft survival. Removal of CNI may remove one long-term problem (CNI toxicity) but potentially cause worsening of other immunological issues which may in turn limit the duration of the graft. Low dose CNI seem the best option and mTOR-I benefits appear to be limited to a reduction in the risks of malignancy and CMV infection, though these benefits are uncertain and are not the case when combined with CNI.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:27:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was poor, with unclear risks of bias due to poor reporting (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>); only 30% reported randomisation method and allocation concealment. Almost all studies were open-label however for study outcomes such as death and graft loss they were not downgraded on GRADE assessment. Studies were analysed as intent to treat in 60% and all pre specified outcomes were reported in 54 studies. Almost half the studies received pharmaceutical funding which were classified as a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The studies also used variable outcome measures and induction immunosuppression regimens. There is also variability in dosing, drug monitoring and time intervals of reporting outcomes. Most studies did not indicate baseline SCr or GFR to assess for changes due to the intervention. The follow-up duration in majority of the included studies was between six months and three years which is a major limitation for concluding long-term outcomes such as patient and graft survival.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:26:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There are multiple limitations of this review. The quality of data reporting was variable in terms of outcome and adverse effects. Most studies did not indicate the baseline creatinine or GFR to assess for changes due to the intervention. The standard deviation or confidence intervals were not noted when recording outcomes such as GFR and creatinine. Adverse effects were prevalent rather than incident cases which may affect outcomes such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. The number of patients affected by individual outcomes were not indicated but mentioned as being significant with or without P values. Outcome reporting was not defined in cases of CMV, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (total or low-density lipoprotein) or diabetes mellitus. Different studies used different targets for CNI monitoring and also used either trough (C0) or two hour (C2) levels; some studies based the dose on mg/kg body weight and this review used the study author definitions to classify low dose and standard dose regimens. This may have some limitation in external validity of these recommendations. However we have tried to minimise this by subclassification into four groups and analyse them further into early and late interventions. Most studies were short-term and did not capture long-term hard outcomes such as graft survival, patient survival or adverse effects (such as cardiovascular outcomes) and malignancy. The duration of the majority of studies was between six months and three years with only three studies of up to five years duration. This raises the concern of how outcomes might be different after that time, particularly with regards to antibody-mediated rejection which can be a complication of reduced immune suppression. The only studies that included more than 10 years of follow-up tended to be much older studies, and compared immunosuppression such as azathioprine which is now largely obsolete or in very little use. The data from these studies is therefore limited by era effect. Studies with longer follow-up are required to confirm the potential benefits of CNI reduction or risks of long-term antibody-mediated rejection, most studies also do not differentiate between patients with high versus low immunological risk.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-07 11:28:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This is the first review which sub classified studies into four different intervention groups and analysed them as low dose calcineurin inhibitor or CNI withdrawal with or without mTOR-I substitution. The classification analysed the possible advantages noted in various studies with additional immunosuppressive agent such as mTOR-I or continuation of CNI at a low dose.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sharif-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharif 2011</LINK> (56 studies, 11,337 participants) showed a similar increase in acute rejection without affecting graft survival, infection, and patient survival, it also concluded an increase in graft failure when mTOR-I was used. The review however did not classify studies into low dose or withdrawal as in our review but performed a pooled analysis which resulted in significant heterogeneity. In contrast to the conclusions of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Sharif-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharif 2011</LINK> reported lower NODAT in the CNI-sparing group. <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK> included only CNI-sparing with MMF. The results were not stratified for mTOR-I; however the studies were classified into those who had de novo CNI minimisation and elective minimisation or elimination of CNI. The results in the withdrawal group were similar to our review but the lower dose of CNI was not beneficial in reduction of acute rejection as we report. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2014</LINK> (29 studies, 2350 participants) analysed conversion to an mTOR-I based immunosuppression from CNI based therapy. They review reported short-term improvements in GFR with mTOR-I but increased acute rejections; there were no differences in graft loss or death. The conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2014</LINK> are similar to our analysis of CNI withdrawal with mTOR-I, however our review also analysed low dose CNI and mTOR-I substitution.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:45:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>CNI avoidance increased acute rejection and CNI withdrawal increases acute rejection but reduced graft loss at least over the short-term. Low dose CNI with induction regimens reduced acute rejection and graft loss with no major adverse events, also in the short-term. The use of mTOR-I reduced CMV infections but increased the risk of acute rejection. These conclusions must be tempered by the lack of long-term data in most of the studies, particularly with regards to chronic antibody-mediated rejection, and the suboptimal methodological quality of the included studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-30 09:58:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Despite a large number of randomised multicentre studies, significant issues remain unanswered. Most study data highlighted short-term outcomes due to the short follow-up. Longer follow-up will highlight hard end points such as cardiovascular outcomes, long-term graft survival and effects on malignancy. Cost benefit analysis and quality of life surveys to assess the effect of lower immunosuppression may also be of significant benefit. Carefully structured longer term studies into immunosuppression of kidney transplant patients need to delineate patient death, malignancy risk in protocols with or without CNI, immunological risk will need to include acute rejection, donor-specific antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection.</P>
