This can lead to diseases that are otherwise preventable by vaccines, having a large effect on individuals and communities. Informing people of an upcoming vaccination or telling them that they have missed a vaccination might help to increase coverage and reduce the effect and impact of disease preventable by vaccine. We reviewed 75 studies to evaluate whether reminding people to get vaccinated worked. The studies we looked at were from different settings, such as rural areas, schools, private practices, and state health departments. Most studies were done in the USA. The studies included a range of different groups: infants and children, adolescents and adults requiring routine vaccination, as well as adults who required the influenza vaccine. In most of the studies reminders took the form of person to person telephone calls, automated calls, letters or postcards. In few recent studies text messaging was used.</P><P><B>Main results of the review</B></P><P>Our review found that reminding people to have vaccinations likely increases the number of people who receive vaccinations by an average of 8 percentage points, although there was variation in the results of the studies. Reminding people by telephone and autodialer calls, sending a letter or postcard, or sending a text message increased vaccinations. Combinations of reminders were also effective. Reminding people over the telephone was more effective than the other types of reminders. The increases in vaccinations were observed among children, adolescents, and adults.</P><P><B>How up-to-date is this review?</B></P><P>We reviewed studies that were published to January 2017.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-05 13:12:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-09 06:51:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini"><P>Immunization rates for children and adults are rising, but coverage levels have not reached optimal goals. As a result, vaccine-preventable diseases still occur. In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules, rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care providers, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings to increase immunization coverage. One common theme across immunization programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population-based approach and identifying all eligible recipients, for example the children who should receive the measles vaccine. However, this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of immunization registries and electronic health records. A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high vaccination rates. Three types of strategies have been studied: (1) patient-oriented interventions, such as patient reminder or recall, (2) provider interventions, and (3) system interventions, such as school laws. One of the most prominent intervention strategies, and perhaps best studied, involves patient reminder or recall systems. This is an update of a previously published review.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-05 09:52:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various types of patient reminder and recall interventions to improve receipt of immunizations.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 07:05:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to January 2017.

Two types of single-method reminders probably improve receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence: the use of telephone calls (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.54; seven studies; 9120 participants) and letters to patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.38; 27 studies; 81,100 participants).</P><P>Based on high certainty evidence, reminders improve receipt of immunizations for childhood (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.29; risk difference of 8%; 23 studies; 31,099 participants) and adolescent vaccinations (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42; <I>r</I>isk difference of 7%; 10 studies; 30,868 participants).

The global rate for three doses of diphtheria tetanus pertussis (DTP3) vaccine was estimated to be 86% in 2014, an increase of 66 percentage points since the 1980 level of 20% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016a</LINK>). However, approximately 18.7 million children did not receive DTP3 during 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016b</LINK>). Rates vary by geographic area or country, with high levels of DTP3, ranging from 91% to 94% in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific in 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016b</LINK>). In 2014, the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and African regions had lower coverage rates of 73% to 84% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016b</LINK>). In the United States, immunization rates remain high and stable for infants and children, but coverage levels have not reached national goals for a number of vaccines, including the newer vaccinations introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seither-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seither 2016</LINK>). Immunization rates remain nowhere near national coverage goals for influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, and adult vaccinations against herpes zoster or shingles and pneumococcal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reagan_x002d_Steiner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reagan-Steiner 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stokley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokley 2014</LINK>). Vaccination rates also vary by state, race, and ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2016a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reagan_x002d_Steiner-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reagan-Steiner 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seither-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seither 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2015</LINK>). For example, influenza immunization rates during the 2013 to 2014 influenza season varied by race or ethnicity, with reports of 46.7% among whites 19 years and older, compared with 36.5% among blacks, and 33.2% among Hispanics or Latinos (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2016</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Burden of vaccine-preventable diseases</HEADING><P>As a result of unmet immunization goals, vaccine-preventable diseases still have a significant effect in a number of countries (<LINK REF="REF-Clemmons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemmons 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-European-CDPC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">European CDPC 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2016</LINK>). This is evidenced by the continued occurrence of measles outbreaks, for example in Disneyland in California during 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-Clemmons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemmons 2015</LINK>). In the European Union and three European Economic Area countries, 11,316 cases of measles were reported during 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-European-CDPC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">European CDPC 2014</LINK>). The burden of vaccine-preventable illnesses has also included approximately 226,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, 3000 to 49,000 influenza-related deaths, and 13,500 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease that occur each year in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2016</LINK>). In Europe, an estimated four to 50 million symptomatic cases of influenza occur each year, and 15,000 to 70,000 deaths have been attributed to influenza annually (<LINK REF="REF-European-CDPC-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">European CDPC 2016</LINK>). Further, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in the US and in some other nations are far lower than optimal, leading to many new cases of HPV infection and ultimately HPV-related cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Viens-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viens 2016</LINK>). Each year, 6.2 million persons are newly infected with HPV, and 26,000 new HPV-related cancers are diagnosed in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstock 2004</LINK>). Cancers attributable to HPV infections lead to more than USD 4 billion in annual medical expenses in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 2014</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-09 06:51:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini"><P>Patient reminders notify populations, patients, or their parents or legal guardians of vaccines that are due because of age or other risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-Vann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson Vann 2005</LINK>). The notification is delivered to populations or patients. Patient recalls refer to notifications of vaccines that are past due. For example, a letter sent to a patient at 60 years of age, informing her that she is now due for the shingles vaccine, is a patient reminder (<LINK REF="REF-Hales-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hales 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-Vann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson Vann 2005</LINK>). The patient who receives a notice at age 61 years about the shingles vaccine is getting a recall because the patient is past due, but would still benefit from receiving a shingles vaccination. Reminders and recalls require the source of the notification, whether a care provider, health services organization, public health authority, or community organization, to have access to the patient's contact information to facilitate the notification. The notification may be delivered by letter, postcard, telephone call, computerized telephone call, or text message (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2015</LINK>). The process would require the source of the notification to have determined the individual patient's status, in terms of being recommended for the vaccine by nature of the patient's age or risk condition or both, and not being vaccinated at the time of the notification.<BR/></P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-09 06:51:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini"><P>Patient reminder or recall interventions work by addressing the common reasons that immunizations may be missed, such as forgetting or missing appointments, not knowing immunization schedules (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2015</LINK>), and having concerns about vaccinations. The success of the patient or reminder recall intervention depends upon several factors, such as accuracy or currency of contact information, accuracy and completeness of vaccination records, viability of contact medium, readability or comprehensibility of the contact medium or message by the patient or patient's parent or legal guardian or caretaker, beliefs and attitudes about vaccinations, and access to health services or vaccinations (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-09 06:51:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini"><P>In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999a</LINK>), rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care physicians, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings. One strategy involves patient reminder or recall systems, which was recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-Task-Force-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS Task Force 2016</LINK>) and the Standards for Immunization Practices (<LINK REF="REF-National-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Vaccine Advisory Committee 2014</LINK>). Despite the successes made in vaccinating populations under-vaccination still occurs, resulting in vaccine-preventable deaths and illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Clemmons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemmons 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-European-CDPC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">European CDPC 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Experts recommend that care providers utilize reminder or recall systems (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-Task-Force-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS Task Force 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Vaccine Advisory Committee 2014</LINK>); however, there is evidence to suggest that few primary care providers actually use immunization reminder or recall systems, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Kempe-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempe 2012c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2003</LINK>). In a national survey of pediatric practices, only 16% of responding practices utilized them (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2003</LINK>).</P><P>A range of different types of reminders and systems of recall are being implemented. Ten countries, including a number in Europe, have adopted computerized immunization information services or registries (<LINK REF="REF-Groom-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groom 2014</LINK>). Immunization registries offer the potential to become the backbone of patient reminder or recall systems by identifying the populations at risk, providing algorithms to determine who is eligible based on vaccination recommendations, and providing systems to send postcards, letters, autodialer messages, and text message reminders (<LINK REF="REF-Kempe-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempe 2012c</LINK>).</P><P>Centralized systems can include health systems, health maintenance organizations, practice 'networks' that share electronic health records, and state or national immunization registries. Several recent studies have demonstrated that centralized reminder and recall systems sent from health systems rather than from practices can raise immunization rates (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kempe-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kempe 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kempe-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kempe 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockwell-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stockwell 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockwell-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Stockwell 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szilagyi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Szilagyi 2013</LINK>).

Reminder and recall cues could also vary in specificity, number, and whether combined with other interventions, such as provider reminders or outreach. Specificity may vary from generic immunization reminders to personal reminders that address patient-specific immunization needs. Frequency may be one-time or multiple reminders.

In addition, all types of patient reminder and recall were found to be effective, with increases in immunization rates tending to range from 5 to 20 percentage points higher in the intervention groups compared with controls. Telephone reminders were the most effective single intervention type, followed by letter reminders, which were somewhat more effective than text message, postcard, and autodialer interventions. In general, combinations of patient reminder or recall interventions, including patient reminder or recall combined with outreach or some type of mailing combined with telephone calls, were not observed to be as effective as the telephone or letter intervention studies included in the meta-analyses. However, some single type reminder or recall interventions used repeated contacts, which may have provided them the same expected advantages as combination interventions.

A study of meta-analyses, which included five or more trials with binary outcomes and used comprehensive literature searches, found English-language trials were more likely to have more study participants, be of higher quality methodologically, and be less likely to produce positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2002</LINK>). The estimates of treatment effects were, on average, 16% more beneficial in non-English language trials compared with English language trials (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2002</LINK>). A second systematic review, focusing on systematic reviews of conventional medical care, found that none of the studies showed major differences in reported treatment effects when comparing those that included versus excluded non-English language studies (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Second, it is possible that the effect of some types of reminders might diminish in the current world in which phone calls, autodialer calls, and even email and text messages are widespread. Some of these interventions may be included as 'standard practice' in the control groups, leading to attenuated findings. Or, as use of technologies changes, it may alter the way in which people respond to different message delivery modes.</P><P>A third potential limitation is publication bias, because the majority of studies in this review were located from MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>Cochrane Library</I>, CINAHL, other bibliographic databases, and references from other studies. Publication bias typically results in failure to publish studies with negative or null findings (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>), therefore it is possible that our findings of positive outcomes in the majority of reviewed studies is partly affected by publication bias, and that the effect of reminder and recall is lower than noted in this review. We attempted to minimize publication bias by searching the files of the review authors and immunization experts, searching references of published reviews for abstracts, and reviewing abstracts or proceedings of major scientific meetings. In addition, funnel plot analyses did not detect publication bias, thereby increasing the plausibility of our positive findings. We conducted searches of grey literature and a clinical trials register to try to identify unpublished studies.<BR/></P><P>A fourth limitation resulted from omitting studies from the meta-analyses that allocated families, households, clinicians, practices, or communities. Fifteen generally well-designed studies, included in the initial review and meta-analyses, were omitted from the current analyses because they randomized families, households, providers, practices, or communities and analyzed patient-level data. While studies of health practice interventions, such as reminder or recall, can minimize contamination by randomizing at the practice level rather than the individual level, and many of these studies did that, reminder or recall of vaccines cannot avoid the effect on household members who may undergo vaccination as a result. That behavior may affect the measured outcomes of the study, but our meta-analysis could not control or adjust for this effect on household members.</P><P>Most of the studies in this review were performed in health systems of developed countries in settings in which the potential recipients generally have primary care providers who they see on a regular or as-needed basis and are followed over time. The providers could be public or private, physicians, nurse practitioners, or other health services experts, generalists, or more specialized providers, such as pediatricians in the US. The cornerstone is that there is a population of potential recipients who would need annual influenza vaccinations, or periodic vaccinations on some schedule, in the case of children. In many developing countries or regions, such a situation does not exist and although health services providers do serve patients, there is little ability to determine the population of eligible vaccine recipients. Thus reminder or recall interventions are found primarily in higher-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Working-Group-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Working Group 2014</LINK>). However, a few studies have been done which, while not eligible for inclusion in our systematic review, show promising results in terms of acceptability, including Guatemala (<LINK REF="STD-Domek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Domek 2016</LINK>), and Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2015</LINK>). Furthermore, a few studies, while of low quality, have been conducted in low-income countries and found an overall positive, albeit relatively low, effect of reminders or recalls on immunizations (<LINK REF="STD-Muehleisen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muehleisen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Usman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Usman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Working-Group-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Working Group 2014</LINK>). More recently, a randomized trial in Zimbabwe found positive effects of reminders or recalls on immunization (<LINK REF="STD-Bangure-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bangure 2015</LINK>). However, in virtually all settings in which patient reminder and recall interventions were rigorously evaluated, and these settings were generally those in which patients were connected with a health system, the reminder and recall systems were found to be effective in improving immunization rates.</P><P>Our review does not include cost data to address questions of cost-effectiveness. The costs of patient reminder or recall interventions were reported in 16 studies, including eight pediatric studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lieu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lieu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linkins-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Linkins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodewald-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodewald 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stehr_x002d_Green-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stehr-Green 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>), and six studies of adults (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDowell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McDowell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nexoe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nexoe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosser 1992</LINK>). Eight studies estimated the cost-effectiveness of reminder and recall systems (<LINK REF="STD-LeBaron-2004" TYPE="STUDY">LeBaron 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lieu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lieu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDowell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McDowell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodewald-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodewald 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosser 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>). Costs varied widely across studies, due to variability in methods of calculating costs and items included in analyses, such as existing staff or computer programming; different types of reminders used; different levels of intensity of interventions, from single postcard reminders to repeated reminders plus home visits; and different study time periods. As a result of the limited cost data reported and variations in the methods, the cost information is of limited use and is not reported. We did not track studies reporting cost data in the current review.</P><P>Finally, it is important to note that even relatively small effect sizes for interventions aimed at increasing immunizations are clinically meaningful because vaccinations are recommended for virtually every individual at some point. Therefore, even a small effect of a patient reminder or recall intervention, if scaled to a population level, might have a large beneficial effect on public health.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING><P>We assessed the certainty of the evidence in the estimate for each outcome and intervention type in our review using GRADE (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). The GRADE assessment for our overall patient reminder recall summary measure was moderate (3; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) rather than high because of some inconsistencies in the findings, with a few effect size outliers in each direction, and variation in the type of reminder or recall delivery mechanisms and messages, and because of some imprecision for several included study arms (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). However, we consider the results to be of moderate certainty because of consistency of the estimates of effect for this outcome from our previous reviews, and the positive findings for all patient reminder or recall intervention types individually.</P><P>We rated the certainty of the evidence as high in four intervention subgroups (postcard; text message; autodialer; combination patient reminder or recall with outreach) and moderate for four subgroups (telephone; letter; combination of mail and phone; combination patient reminder or recall and provider reminder). We rated the certainty of the evidence as high in the childhood and adolescent vaccination subgroup analyses, moderate in the childhood and adult influenza vaccination sub-analyses, and low in the other adult vaccination sub-analysis. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for other adult vaccinations because only four studies were included in this subgroup, risk ratios ranged from 1.08 to 3.61, and some imprecision was observed in two studies. In general, the risk of bias was not serious for the majority of our 75 included studies, with one of eight risk of bias criteria rated as high in 11 studies, two criteria rated as high in nine studies, and three criteria rated as high in three studies. Fifty-two included studies had ratings of low or unclear risk of bias for all nine criteria.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-12-06 23:14:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our review process has potential limitations with respect to our method of pooling data, particularly in light of heterogeneity of some of the data, which is often present in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1991</LINK>). These reminder or recall studies were performed in a variety of populations, using different interventions, in multiple settings, targeting different types and numbers of immunizations, and across five decades; therefore it is not surprising that there is between-study heterogeneity in the results. Indeed, we found heterogeneity in study components. Populations ranged from infants due for their well-child visit vaccinations, to adolescents past due for the human papillomavirus vaccine, to older adults due for influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, and adults who had not received the influenza vaccination during the prior year. Some study populations represented the general public, while others targeted those at high risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Some populations represented practice panels, whereas others a specific geographical region. The interventions varied by mode, including telephone, letter, postcard, text message, and autodialer, and intensity, in terms of number as well as perhaps tone, and complexity, from single to step-wise interventions. Text messages, as a medium, introduce another source for heterogeneity across studies - that is, self-selection - because these studies required patients or their parents to provide their cell phone numbers and specifically approve text messaging for this intervention.</P><P>By necessity, our investigation could not separate high-intensity interventions from low-intensity interventions. Studies that employed more than one study arm, where one arm used a high-intensity intervention and a second used a low-intensity intervention, contributed to the meta-analysis with the average of their effect. Similarly, the control groups differed somewhat in terms of the types of other practice, media, and community-based interventions that may have influenced immunizations. In general, we excluded studies that implemented interventions in the control groups that were expected to have a substantial influence on immunization rates. However, we chose to include a few studies with lower-intensity interventions in the control group if they were standard practice, thereby potentially diminishing the observed effect (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ferson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LeBaron-2004" TYPE="STUDY">LeBaron 2004</LINK>). Some concerns with control group exposure are not very amenable to change, such as external media campaigns, however, some of these factors may have exerted similar influences on intervention and control participants.</P><P>Our outcomes also varied in terms of the number of immunizations needed per participant and types of immunizations. We defined our primary outcome as receipt of any needed immunizations. In some studies, participants were targeted to receive only one immunization, such as one dose of the influenza vaccine. In some studies participants were targeted to receive a series of the same vaccine, such as human papillomavirus (HPV). In others, especially for children, participants were targeted to receive a series of immunizations. We addressed this, in part, by conducting sub-analyses by participant and immunization type, such as adult influenza, child influenza, and other child vaccinations, which tended to group similar types of outcomes. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis to assess whether omitting studies that defined outcomes as up-to-date for immunizations changed our findings; however, our results were very similar after removing studies with outcomes defined as up-to-date.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-06 23:16:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The findings of our systematic review are similar to other published reviews of patient and parent-focused interventions aimed at increasing receipt of immunizations (<LINK REF="REF-Groom-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groom 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niccolai-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niccolai 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odone-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odone 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watterson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Groom-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groom 2015</LINK> examined the effectiveness of immunization information systems in supporting interventions aimed at increasing immunization rates.

Of the 14 included studies, seven examined the effect of reminder and recall systems, four using randomized designs. Interventions included letters, telephone calls, text messages, and outreach visits. Each of the seven studies reported increases in at least one HPV vaccination outcome attributable to the intervention. <LINK REF="REF-Odone-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odone 2015</LINK> focused on the effect of 'new media' interventions, such as text messaging, smart-phone applications, YouTube videos, Facebook, targeted websites and portals, software for health professionals, and emails, on vaccination coverage. Most of the 19 included studies were conducted in the US; both text messaging and patient-held web-based portals were found to be somewhat effective in increasing immunization rates. <LINK REF="REF-Oyo_x002d_Ita-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyo-Ita 2016</LINK> examined the effect of several intervention types on improving immunization coverage among children in low- and middle-income countries.

Last, <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2011</LINK> studied the effect of interventions aimed at improving immunizations among children in developed countries. Fourteen of 41 intervention arms among 22 studies of parental reminders and recalls showed positive outcomes.

It is important to note that some of the systematic reviews had considerable overlap with our review in terms of included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2011</LINK>). Some of these reviews focused on multiple interventions and did not exclude studies with interventions received by control group participants. Our systematic review was the most comprehensive of those examining patient reminder and recall interventions.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-06 23:31:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-06 23:25:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The findings from this updated systematic review continue to show that implementing patient reminder and recall systems improve immunization coverage levels in primary care. Evidence from our review is supportive of recommendations from a number of bodies (<LINK REF="REF-AdHoc-Working-Group" TYPE="REFERENCE">AdHoc Working Group</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shefer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Udovic-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udovic 1998</LINK>). In all settings that were evaluated, patient reminder and recall systems appear to be effective for improving immunization rates. As such, methods to incorporate reminder and recall systems into practices should have a positive effect on vaccine-preventable diseases. Different types of reminder and recall systems can be tailored to suit specific provider or practice needs. While person-to-person telephone reminders are most effective, they may also be more costly than other methods, and have not been studied extensively in children, except for the use of autodialers, which were found to have smaller but positive effects. However, for this update we identified five new studies that assessed the effect of letter reminder or recall interventions on immunization rates, and one new study focused on childhood influenza vaccination. Practical issues relevant to choices of reminder and recall systems include: characteristics of current computer systems, staffing, perceived accuracy of patient telephone numbers or addresses, availability of computer programmers, and estimated patient responsiveness to different types of reminders. These factors vary widely across nations or geographic regions; therefore immunization leaders will want to interpret the findings in this review with respect to their own setting. For example, settings with widely used computerized immunization registries could adopt postcard reminders sent by the registries. Practitioners today can tailor their own billing systems to function as reminder and recall systems for simple procedures, such as selecting all patients over 65 years of age for reminders about influenza or pneumococcal vaccination. Many billing systems have recently incorporated separate modules that can track immunization status.<BR/></P><P>A critical issue involves the complexity of 'rules' required for a reminder or recall system. The simplest scenario involves older adults, because no special immunization algorithm is needed, and eligible patients can be selected by birth dates. A slightly more complex scenario involves 'flagging' adult patients with problems such as end-stage renal disease, including those receiving hemodialysis, with HIV infection, or with chronic liver disease that may require hepatitis B vaccinations. More sophisticated algorithms are required to track prior immunization status, particularly for the complicated pediatric immunization schedule. A very promising approach involves vaccine providers recording the administered vaccines in computerized immunization registries shared across the region. These have been developed in many European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2012</LINK>), as well as Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2012</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian 1998</LINK>), New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-Wansbrough-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wansbrough 2009</LINK>), and the United States (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NVAC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NVAC 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2000</LINK>), and are being developed in various forms in developing nations (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch_x002d_Capblanch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch-Capblanch 2009</LINK>). These registries already contain the necessary algorithms to assess the up-to-date status of children, and could be modified to deliver patient reminders. Finally, databases of managed care organizations and accountable care organizations can be modified to become reminder and recall systems. For practitioners, the usefulness of such databases depends on the proportion of a practice's patients covered by the managed care plan and the accuracy of the database information.<BR/></P><P>Overall, the technology exists, in the developed world, to incorporate patient reminder and recall into routine primary care practice. There are additional benefits to the patient and practice, beyond improving immunization rates. Studies have shown that patients behind with immunizations are also behind in other measures of preventive care (<LINK REF="REF-Fairbrother-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairbrother 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodewald-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodewald 1995</LINK>), and that reminder or recall systems targeting immunizations can also have "spillover effects" to improve other aspects of preventive care (<LINK REF="STD-Rodewald-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodewald 1999</LINK>), if they are used within primary care practices.</P><P>The use of patient reminder and recall systems provides the primary care practitioner with real-life experience at practicing population-based care, by improving the care for the entire population served by the practice (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 2000</LINK>). Although medicine is traditionally taught and practiced one patient at a time, and preventive services such as immunizations are delivered to individual patients, the measures of success, such as immunization rates, are population-based. Such population-based primary care, while not easy to do in a busy practice, has the potential to improve the quality of care and performance of primary care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OConnor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">OConnor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivo 1998</LINK>).</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-12-06 23:31:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This study also has implications for research. Again, this updated systematic review includes 28 new studies and addresses two new technologies not addressed previously. They include electronic simple-message system text messages and electronic medical record messages in secured patient portals. As these technologies mature, researchers should consider how they can enhance reminder and recall interventions and what improvements in their effect can be achieved. We suspect that additional new technologies will also debut and researchers should test those platforms as well. Indeed, the Ericsson Mobility Report, published in 2015, reported 7.1 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-Ericsson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ericsson 2015</LINK>). That number included 2.6 billion smartphones, telephones with data plans that perform many of the functions of a computer, typically having Internet access and capable of running downloaded applications or apps. Ericsson predicts that in 2020 these numbers will increase to 9.2 and 7.7 billion respectively. That means that in 2020 Ericsson predicts that 70 per cent of the world's population will have a smartphone. Much of the growth will occur in the Middle East and Africa and parts of the Asia Pacific region. Thus the growth of smartphone availability, even in the next five years, promises new opportunities for reminder and recall innovation.</P><P>With the plethora of studies showing that patient reminder and recall systems improve immunization rates in all types of settings, future researchers should consider not simply repeating prior studies but rather building on them and addressing gaps. For example, only six included studies focused on text message interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Bangure-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bangure 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Moniz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Leary-2015" TYPE="STUDY">O'Leary 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockwell-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stockwell 2012a</LINK>). Four of these studies examined text message reminders and the effect on adolescent immunizations (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Leary-2015" TYPE="STUDY">O'Leary 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockwell-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stockwell 2012a</LINK>), one focused on pregnant women and influenza vaccinations (<LINK REF="STD-Moniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Moniz 2013</LINK>), and one focused on childhood immunizations (<LINK REF="STD-Bangure-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bangure 2015</LINK>). None of these included studies examined the effect of text messages on childhood influenza or other adult vaccinations. The effect sizes were generally positive, with only two demonstrating a relatively strong effect size (<LINK REF="STD-Rand-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockwell-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Stockwell 2012a</LINK>). There is a need to explore the characteristics and intensity of the interventions, target populations, and target immunizations to identify the most effective use of text message reminder and recall interventions. This need to learn more about characteristics of the most effective text message interventions was also a conclusion in a review of systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2015</LINK>), which found text messages to be generally effective in improving several types of health behaviors, such as diabetes, weight loss, physical activity, and smoking cessation.</P><P>Much of the focus, so far, with reminder and recall interventions is the evaluation of the effect on vaccines received. Reminders, rather than recalls, also have the theoretical ability to maintain a patient with on-time vaccinations, i.e. receipt of vaccinations by the recommended age or time, as opposed to up-to-date, i.e. the number or proportion of the population who have received the vaccine at a certain point in time, whether or not they received the vaccine by the recommended age or time. Researchers should consider testing the effect of patient reminders on on-time vaccination as a particular outcome.</P><P>Only five included studies examined the effect of reminder and recall interventions on childhood influenza vaccinations (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dombkowski-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dombkowski 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kempe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kempe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemper-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kemper 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szilagyi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Szilagyi 1992</LINK>); four of five studies used letter reminders and one used a combination of letter and postcard (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 2004a</LINK>). No included studies examined the use of telephone calls, autodialer, text messages, or other combination interventions on influenza vaccination among children. With approximately 40 percent of children, ages six months to 17 years, not having received the influenza vaccination during the 2014 to 2015 influenza season (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2016b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2016b</LINK>), it is important to better understand how to improve these rates.</P><P>Previously we had identified a single study that reviewed adolescent immunization delivery in an urban setting (<LINK REF="STD-Szilagyi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Szilagyi 2006</LINK>).

With the rising importance of adolescent immunizations and the multiple settings in which adolescents receive care, additional studies of adolescents would be useful for determining which strategies may be most effective.</P><P>The rapid implementation of computerized immunization registries presents opportunities for research in implementing, on a community-wide basis, reminder and recall interventions that appear to be effective in single practice settings. In addition, managed care plans have databases that could be used as the backbone of reminder and recall interventions; studies incorporating such linkages would be helpful. The relatively recent implementation of patient portal systems and secure messaging with patients within these systems is another area to be further explored. None of the patient portal studies we reviewed met the inclusion criteria for this review. Patient portals linking the electronic health record systems, for example, could support reminders and recalls for additional vaccinations based on high-risk indications. Studies about 'fine-tuning' patient reminder and recall interventions would be helpful, such as investigations of the degree to which different combinations improve outcomes, or the degree to which combinations of patient reminder and recall and other types of interventions improve outcomes. Finally, because the majority of reviewed studies of patient reminder and recall interventions found positive effects, any studies that do not find improved immunization uptake should carefully investigate the reasons for lack of improvement. Such detailed investigations may uncover important barriers to care delivery that are likely to be useful in better understanding how to improve services for patients.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 06:51:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini"><P>We wish to acknowledge:</P><UL><LI>Sharon Humiston for her help and wisdom;</LI><LI>Lisa Bero and Jeremy Grimshaw for editorial assistance and guidance with the review process;</LI><LI>Bridget Hochwalt for obtaining and formatting full references for excluded studies;</LI><LI>Sharlini Yogasingam for conducting literature searches, and creating and importing full references into RevMan;</LI><LI>Julia Worswick and Daniela Gonçalves Bradley for supporting the review update process, providing expertise, guidance and editorial assistance;</LI><LI>Elizabeth Moreton for editing the search process text;</LI><LI>Paul Miller for conducting updated searches and editing search-related text;</LI><LI>Sasha Shepperd and Simon Lewin for reviewing drafts and providing methodological guidance and support;</LI><LI>Sofia Massa, Cillyen Nkengafac Motaze, Kumanan Wilson, and Nigel Crawford for reviewing and providing feedback on drafts of the review.</LI></UL><P>National Institute for Health Research, via Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group.
