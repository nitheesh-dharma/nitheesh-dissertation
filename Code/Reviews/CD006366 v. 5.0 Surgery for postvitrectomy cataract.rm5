of surgery to remove the lens from eyes in which cataracts (clouding of the lens in front of the eye) develop after vitrectomy. Vitrectomy surgery is used to remove the vitreous (the clear gel) in the center of the eye during repair or amelioration of a number of retinal disorders (such as retinal detachment and macular holes or in cases of vitreous hemorrhage).</P><P><B>What was studied in this review?</B><BR/>Vitrectomy can result in the formation or acceleration of cataract. The underlying problem that led to vitrectomy may affect visual acuity, quality of life, and other outcomes after the surgery to remove the cataractous lens.</P><P><B>Main results</B><BR/>We found no randomized controlled trials (trials in which participants had been randomly assigned to one treatment group or another) that evaluated the benefits or risks (or both) of cataract surgery following vitrectomy. Since cataract surgery may lead to loss of vision due to worsening or recurrence of the condition that prompted the vitrectomy, its role in these patients remains unknown. Future trials to address this review question should separate participants by age, the disorder leading to vitrectomy, and the status of the underlying disease process in the opposite eye. Outcomes relevant to patients such as improvement in visual acuity, other measures of vision, and quality of life usually expected from cataract surgery, and harms should be examined both in the short term (six months after cataract surgery) and in the long term (one to two years after cataract surgery).</P><P><B>Key messages</B><BR/>There is an evidence gap as to whether surgery to remove cataracts in people in whose eyes cataracts develop after vitrectomy is better than no surgery.<BR/></P><P><B>How up-to-date is the review?</B><BR/>We searched for studies published up to 17 May 2017.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:29:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:25:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cataract formation or acceleration can occur after intraocular surgery, especially following vitrectomy, a surgical technique for removing the vitreous that is used in the treatment of many disorders that affect the posterior segment of the eye.

Vitrectomy first was developed by Machemer in 1971 (<LINK REF="REF-Machemer-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machemer 1971</LINK>). Advances in surgical technique and instrumentation over the past 40 years have made vitrectomy a common surgical procedure for posterior segment disorders. Vitrectomy is indicated for numerous ocular conditions including vitreous loss in cataract surgery, subluxation of the lens, malignant glaucoma, dense pupillary membranes, non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetic retinopathy or vein occlusions, retinal detachment, macular hole, macular pucker, vitreo-macular traction, and endophthalmitis. Specialized instruments and techniques are used to gain access to the vitreous cavity and retina. During vitrectomy surgery, three small incisions, each approximately 1.4 mm in length, are made in the eye in order to place instruments: a vitreous cutter, a fiber optic light source to illuminate the inside of the eye, and an infusion cannula to maintain proper intraocular pressure during the removal of the vitreous and other surgical maneuvers. At the end of surgery, the vitreous cavity may be filled with air, gas, silicone oil, or another type of tamponade to reduce the risk of retinal detachment or may be left unfilled.</P><P>Although vitrectomy has revolutionized the treatment of posterior segment disorders and improved visual outcomes in people with retinal diseases requiring surgical intervention, vitrectomy may compromise visual acuity by inducing cataract formation or progression in phakic eyes (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1988</LINK>). The three types of cataract are classified according to the location of the opacity: cortical, nuclear sclerosis, and posterior subcapsular. The type of cataract that forms or accelerates after vitrectomy is nuclear sclerotic cataract. In their 2004 review, Panozzo and Parolini noted that "Cataract formation is the most frequent complication of pars plana vitrectomy, even without the use of air, gas, or silicone oil". They reported that published proportions of eyes followed for at least 12 months in which nuclear sclerotic cataract developed after vitrectomy without vitreous tamponade ranged from 12% to 80% depending upon the length of follow-up and age of patients at time of vitrectomy. Published proportions for eyes followed for at least 12 months after vitrectomy and gas tamponade ranged from 45% to 84% (<LINK REF="REF-Panozzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panozzo 2004</LINK>).</P><P>The exact pathogenesis of cataract formation or acceleration after vitrectomy is unknown. Older studies have suggested that light toxicity, oxidation of lens proteins, use of intraocular gas, and length of operative time may be causative factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cherfan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherfan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Bustros-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Bustros 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogura-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogura 1991</LINK>). Newer research suggests that vitrectomy surgery increases oxygen tension within the eye; oxygen exposure has been linked with progressive nuclear sclerotic cataract formation (<LINK REF="REF-Holekamp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holekamp 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmquist-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmquist 1988</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING><P>As noted by Panozzo and Parolini, the studies they cited regarding cataract after vitrectomy typically were retrospective in design, varied in the method of diagnosing and classifying cataract, and reported the outcome after differing lengths of time after vitrectomy. The most reliable incidence data have been reported from multicenter randomized trials in which vitrectomy was an intervention because of their prospective design, detailed description of methods of cataract classification, and scheduled follow-up examinations and procedures for study eyes.</P><P>The Vitrectomy for Macular Hole Study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated vitrectomy for the treatment of macular holes, retrospectively examined the incidence of cataract progression from baseline scores among 74 phakic eyes of participants in the study who had only a single vitrectomy procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2001</LINK>). Investigators used a scoring system similar to the Lens Opacities Classification System II, which contains five grading categories for nuclear and posterior subcapsular opacities. Although duration of surgery did not increase the risk for cataract progression, vitrectomy itself was a risk factor for cataract acceleration; 60/74 (81%) eyes in the surgery cohort had nuclear sclerotic cataract progression at six months of follow-up, compared with only 13/74 (18%) fellow eyes in the control group. Mean scores for nuclear sclerosis had increased from 1.08 ± 0.72 at baseline to 1.51 ± 0.59 by 12 months. By two years, 100% of eyes in the surgery cohort had cataract progression, compared with 8% of control eyes.</P><P>During the late 1990s, the Submacular Surgery Trials (SST) were initiated to evaluate surgical removal of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) compared with observation in people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (SST Group N and Group B studies), ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS) (SST Group H study), and idiopathic CNV (SST Group H study) (<LINK REF="REF-SST-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SST-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SST-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 2004c</LINK>). In these three randomized controlled trials, visually significant cataract was defined as either cataract surgery or lens opacity reported by the SST ophthalmologist to be sufficient to reduce visual acuity by two or more lines in a normal eye. Among the AMD participants in the SST Group N study, 80% of eyes assigned to vitrectomy and surgical removal of their subfoveal CNV had developed visually significant cataracts by two years of follow-up. Sixty per cent of eyes had undergone cataract surgery by their last follow-up examination two to four years after enrollment. Among the OHS participants in the SST Group H study, 39% of eyes assigned to vitrectomy developed visually significant cataracts, among which 24% underwent cataract removal. The difference between eyes with AMD and eyes with OHS developing postvitrectomy cataract was likely due to the median age of the participants. Patients under the age of 50 years have been reported rarely to develop postsurgical accelerated nuclear sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Melberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melberg 1995</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING><P>As with other cataract, eyes with postvitrectomy cataract typically present with decreased visual acuity despite anatomic and initial functional success of the vitrectomy surgery. Individuals who have undergone vitrectomy may have had lower levels of pre-vitrectomy visual acuity or other vision deficits due to the underlying retinal pathology; therefore those with postvitrectomy cataract may present with poorer vision than individuals with typical age-related cataracts. Diagnosis is based on ocular examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, recognition of nuclear sclerosis, and the history of vitrectomy.</P></SUBSECTION></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:55:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cataract surgery, typically performed using phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, commonly is recommended for individuals with visually significant lens opacities. Two features of postvitrectomy nuclear sclerosis make affected lenses especially challenging for cataract surgeons to remove. The nucleus tends to be harder than in age-related nuclear sclerosis, requiring longer phacoemulsification time during the procedure. Also, the absence of vitreous in the posterior segment allows for more mobility of the posterior capsule, increasing the risk of capsular rupture. Surgery for postvitrectomy nuclear sclerotic cataract thus may be associated with a higher incidence of complications, although evidence from comparative studies is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Ahfat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahfat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Biro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biro 2002</LINK>). Thus, surgery to remove the lens of eyes with postvitrectomy cataract may result in no or less visual acuity improvement and more complications than usually anticipated following surgery for typical age-related cataract. <B><BR/></B></P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-24 16:22:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>While people who develop cataract after vitrectomy may undergo cataract extraction, visual acuity and other outcomes after cataract surgery may be poor due to the underlying retinal disorder. Most people who have vitrectomy surgery have serious underlying problems, as indicated by the reasons for vitrectomy. Furthermore, eyes with postvitrectomy cataract are at risk of the complications that can affect all eyes that undergo cataract surgery such as endophthalmitis, cystoid macular edema, etc. Vision is often already impaired before cataract surgery and may remain impaired after cataract surgery. Although cataract surgery in a normal eye typically improves vision, the visual prognosis after surgery for postvitrectomy cataract is uncertain. It likely depends on the success of treatment for the retinal disorder and avoidance of complications during cataract surgery.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-14 22:16:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The incidence of cataract formation after vitrectomy varies widely and has been reported to be between 6% and 100%. The majority of published studies confirm that a high rate of cataract formation occurs, but few data are available on visual acuity outcomes after cataract removal. The retinal problem that led to vitrectomy may progress or recur. However, peer-reviewed data on outcomes after surgery for postvitrectomy cataract are scarce. Even in cases in which cataract formation is not due to vitrectomy, visual impairment can still exist despite cataract extraction. The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study published visual acuity outcomes after cataract extraction in adult Latinos and reported that 41% of eyes had visual impairment (defined as a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 Snellen equivalent or less) (<LINK REF="REF-Bara_x00f1_ano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barañano 2007</LINK>). Age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy accounted for approximately 57% of retinal pathology after cataract extraction. In addition, in eyes that have undergone vitrectomy surgery the absence of vitreous in the posterior segment allows for more mobility of the posterior capsule, increasing the risk of capsular rupture. Surgery for postvitrectomy nuclear sclerotic cataract may be associated with a higher incidence of complications. A prospective case series demonstrated postoperative complications such as posterior capsule rupture, lens subluxation, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal redetachment (<LINK REF="REF-Pardo_x002d_Mu_x00f1_oz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardo-Muñoz 2006</LINK>). A systematic review of outcomes from controlled clinical trials would therefore provide information for adequate counseling of patients and for guiding ophthalmologists' recommendations.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-14 02:00:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgery versus no surgery for postvitrectomy cataract with respect to visual acuity, quality of life, and other outcomes.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:56:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:56:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-12-12 14:56:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We planned to include eligible randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials in this review as described in our review protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Do-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Do 2007</LINK>).

The majority of the published literature on this subject is limited to retrospective case reports or non-randomized prospective case series (<LINK REF="REF-Ahfat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahfat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pardo_x002d_Mu_x00f1_oz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardo-Muñoz 2006</LINK>). The dearth of information on surgery for postvitrectomy cataract indicates that appropriate research on this topic is needed, as thousands of people undergo vitrectomy each year and are at risk of development of cataract and cataract surgery. Documentation of both the risks and benefits of surgery for postvitrectomy cataract from randomized trials is needed to inform patient counseling and clinical recommendations.</P></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-12 15:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-12 15:00:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In the absence of data from controlled trials, ophthalmologists have no reliable evidence on which to base their advice to patients regarding the risks and benefits of surgery for postvitrectomy cataract, and no basis for recommendations for or against cataract surgery or when to intervene surgically. Although eyes that have not had vitrectomy are at risk of some complications following cataract surgery, primarily cystoid macular edema, the risks for eyes with postvitrectomy are greater. It is possible that some of the complications of surgery for postvitrectomy cataract could be reduced if surgery were known to be beneficial, at least in some subgroups of patients, and to be beneficial if performed at an early stage of development of nuclear sclerosis. Data from retrospective studies are inadequate for these purposes.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-12-12 15:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is a clear need for well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the benefits and risks of surgery for cataracts that develop following vitrectomy. We recommend that randomization in such trials be stratified by patients' age, retinal disorder leading to vitrectomy, and status of the pathologic process in the contralateral eye. Because people who undergo vitrectomy already have reduced vision due to the underlying condition that prompted vitrectomy, relevant outcomes such as quality of life and other outcomes that are important to patients should be considered in addition to visual acuity and other clinical measures of vision. Analyses should address both short-term (six-month) and long-term (one-year to two-year) outcomes. Data on adverse outcomes, including complications of surgery such as posterior capsular rupture, should be documented in future trials.</P><P>Because surgery for age-related cataract is so common, there are perceived ethical difficulties in conducting a randomized trial of surgery for postvitrectomy cataract. Randomization to immediate surgery versus observation for an extended period may not be a design acceptable to ophthalmologists or patients. Other designs may be more acceptable, for example, randomization to immediate cataract surgery versus delayed cataract surgery, for a defined period of time or based on rate of cataract progression or other criteria. The pool of patients available for a randomized trial of any design may be hampered by the current trend of combined vitrectomy and lens removal in elderly patients. However, with careful planning, it should be possible to overcome the logistical and ethical challenges of designing and conducting appropriate randomized trials.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-10-14 22:47:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank Iris Gordon, Information Specialist for Cochrane Eyes and Vision, for designing and conducting the electronic searches.
