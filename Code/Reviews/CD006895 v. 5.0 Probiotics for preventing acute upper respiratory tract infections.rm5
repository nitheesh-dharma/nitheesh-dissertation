<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-27 21:36:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>With the increasing consumption of probiotics (live micro-organisms), we carried out a review on the effects of probiotics in helping people (without immunodeficiencies) to avoid acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), for example, the common cold, compared to placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>URTIs include the common cold and inflammation of the trachea and larynx, with symptoms including fever, cough, pain and headaches. Most acute URTIs are caused by viral infections and usually resolve after three to seven days. To reduce the incidence of these infections, specific vaccines are often recommended, especially for children and old people.</P>
<P>Some probiotics (live micro-organisms) can confer a health benefit to the patient when administered in adequate amounts. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are the most common types of probiotics. They are commonly consumed in fermented foods, such as yogurt and soy yogurt, or as dietary supplements. However, their effects in preventing URTIs are still poorly understood.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and search date</B>
</P>
<P>After searching for all relevant trials in scientific databases, we identified 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2014. We could extract and pool data from 12 RCTs, which involved 3720 participants (both genders), including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people from Finland, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Croatia, Chile, Thailand and Japan.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Probiotics were found to be better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI by about 47% and the duration of an episode of acute URTI by about 1.89 days. Probiotics may slightly reduce antibiotic use and cold-related school absence. Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence is low or very low mainly due to poorly conducted trials, for example with unclear randomisation method and blinding. Some trials were supported by manufacturers of the tested probiotics and some trials had a very small sample size.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we found probiotics to be better than placebo in preventing acute URTIs. However, more trials are needed to confirm this conclusion.</P>

<P>We included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyse 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people.

Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio 0.83; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, P value = 0.12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.19, P value = 0.40, low quality evidence). Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when we conducted pooled analyses and the evidence level was low or very low quality.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-27 19:38:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), which include the common cold, acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), acute epiglottitis (supraglottitis), acute rhinosinusitis and acute otitis media (AOM), are a major cause of morbidity, especially in children and the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Duijvestijn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijvestijn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kassel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liberati-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberati 2009</LINK>). They are caused by a large variety of viruses and bacteria. Acute URTIs are the most common reason for people to seek medical care in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>), and at least one billion colds occur there per year, with a frequency of two to six colds per person (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute URTIs are usually mild, viral infections with symptoms subsiding after a few days. They account for up to 75% of all antibiotic use in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2001</LINK>). Antibiotics are often misused in acute URTIs with viral aetiologies (<LINK REF="REF-Steinman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinman 2003</LINK>), despite the fact that the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is inevitable. Although the causes of antibiotic resistance are multifactorial (<LINK REF="REF-Tenover-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenover 1996</LINK>), antibiotic overuse is a major contributor (<LINK REF="REF-Seppala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppala 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-27 19:47:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Probiotics, a Greek word meaning 'for life', were first described by Kollath more than 50 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Kollath-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollath 1953</LINK>). Probiotics are now defined as "live micro-organisms administered in adequate amounts which confer a beneficial physiological effect on the host" (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2003</LINK>). Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, the application of probiotics shows some promising results and trends with respect to immune modulations. Limited evidence from systematic reviews shows that probiotics are beneficial for treating infectious diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Bernaola-Aponte-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernaola Aponte 2013</LINK>), preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2002</LINK>), and treating vaginal infections in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Othman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Othman 2010</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-27 21:33:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of possible means by which probiotics may improve health, one of which is the immunomodulation of local immunity (by maintaining gut wall integrity) and systemic immunity (by enhancing non-specific and specific arms of the immune system). For example:</P>

Natural killer (NK) cell (a type of cytotoxic cell that constitutes an important part of the innate immune system) activity is also markedly improved, and there are increases in the percentage of NK cells in the peripheral blood (<LINK REF="REF-Drakes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drakes 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>More than a century ago, Nobel Prize winner Elie Metchnikoff conducted a series of trials showing that ingesting microbes that produce lactic acid by fermentation improves ailments such as digestive and respiratory tract disorders. The first evidence that probiotic strains could prevent respiratory tract infections was shown when mice were successfully protected against influenza through the administration of <I>Bifidobacterium breve</I> (<I>B. breve</I>) YIT4064 augmented anti-influenza IgG (<LINK REF="REF-Yasui-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasui 1999</LINK>). Soon after, Finnish researchers conducted trials amongst children in daycare centres who were given milk containing <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </I>(<I>L. rhamnosus</I>) GG (ATCC 53103) during winter (<LINK REF="STD-Hatakka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hatakka 2001</LINK>). However, one study showed that the probiotics did not have any effect on upper respiratory infections after the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Hatakka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hatakka 2007</LINK>). With the increasing consumption of probiotics, we feel there is a need to fully understand the effect of probiotics on acute URTIs and their potential adverse effects in humans.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-01-27 20:58:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed data using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We were only able to perform limited pooled analyses. We used a random-effects model for pooled analysis of both heterogeneous data and homogeneous data. We expressed results as odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We calculated the rate ratio of episode rates (events per person/year) of acute URTIs between two groups and the standard error (SE) of the rate ratio according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the generic inverse variance weighting when pooling trials for this outcome. In this review, when the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not span 1.0 or P value &lt; 0.05, we considered this to be statistically significant.</P>

There were 986 participants in the probiotics group and 941 participants in the placebo group. All of the trials reported participants who experienced at least one episode of acute URTI and three trials reported participants who experienced at least three episodes of acute URTI (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautava-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rautava 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sanz 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling of these seven trials showed a benefit of the use of probiotics in preventing the occurrence of at least one episode of URTI (odds ratio (OR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.76). One study, <LINK REF="STD-Berggren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 2010</LINK>, was conducted in adults and one study, <LINK REF="STD-Fujita-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fujita 2013</LINK>, was conducted in the elderly.

<P>In this review, we found that probiotics are better than placebo in reducing the number of participants who experience episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence. Adverse events were minor. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because the included outcomes were unsatisfactory and susceptible to bias due to the fact that some of them were extracted from only one or two trials, and in some subgroups the level of heterogeneity between pooled trials was substantial. In addition, some trials had small sample sizes and the quality of the methods used in these trials was not very good. Furthermore, some trials did not assess the most important outcomes defined in this review as the main outcomes in their original trials.</P>

<P>In this review, most of the included trials were conducted in children (<LINK REF="STD-Caceres-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Caceres 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hojsak-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Hojsak 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hojsak-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Hojsak 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautava-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rautava 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rerksuppaphol-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rerksuppaphol 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sanz 2006</LINK>). We analysed subgroups according to the different ages of participants and found that probiotics showed a benefit in reducing the number of children who experienced URTI episodes. However, we did not find any trial reporting the duration of an episode of URTI in children. The probiotics were given in milk-based food, such as yogurt, for three months or more in most of the trials.</P>
<P>A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial (RCT), conducted in 18 municipal daycare centres, in similar socioeconomic areas in north, west and north-east Helsinki found that <I>Lactobacillus</I> <I>rhamnosus</I> GG milk may reduce the rate and severity of respiratory infections and antibiotic treatment among children in daycare centres (<LINK REF="STD-Hatakka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hatakka 2001</LINK>). Another study included 309 otitis-prone children (at least four episodes of acute otitis media). We included this study in the previous version of our review (<LINK REF="STD-Hatakka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hatakka 2007</LINK>). In this update, after reassessing it, we excluded it because otitis-prone children may have an immunodeficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Yamanaka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamanaka 1997</LINK>). In this study, the author also found that probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of acute otitis media or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Probiotics for acute URTIs in the elderly and adults</HEADING>
<P>Infections often occur in older people as the immune system weakens with age (<LINK REF="REF-Valente-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valente 2009</LINK>). As such, it is very important to compare the treatment effect between older people. Until now, only four trials have been found that compare probiotics to placebo in older people (<LINK REF="STD-Fujita-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fujita 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guillemard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guillemard 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makino-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turchet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Turchet 2003</LINK>). One study was a unicentric, randomised, stratified, open, pilot study, where 360 community residents over 60 years of age were randomised to receive (a) one 100 ml bottle of Actimel (a milk fermented with yogurt cultures and <I>Lactobacillus casei</I> (<I>L. casei</I>) DN-114 001, containing 10<SUP>8</SUP> colony-forming units (CFU)/ml <I>L. casei</I> DN-114 001) twice daily for three weeks, or (b) they were in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Turchet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Turchet 2003</LINK>). The study found no difference in the incidence of winter infections between groups. However, they found that the duration of all pathologies and maximal temperature was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group. The other study was also a multicentric, double-blind controlled trial, involving 1072 volunteers (median age 76 years) randomised to consumption of either probiotic strain <I>L. casei</I> DN-114 001 or control for three months (<LINK REF="STD-Guillemard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guillemard 2010</LINK>). The probiotic group was associated with a decreased duration of common infectious diseases in comparison to the control group, especially URTIs.</P>
<P>In our <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>, we only included participants who were not vaccinated against influenza or other acute URTIs within the last 12 months; 82% of participants in one study had been vaccinated against influenza three months before the study (<LINK REF="STD-Turchet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Turchet 2003</LINK>). In addition, the study did not separate acute URTIs from other winter infections. Another study included participants vaccinated against the influenza virus prior to receiving the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Guillemard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guillemard 2010</LINK>). We therefore decided to exclude these two trials.</P>
<P>One included study contains reports from two trials: the Funagata study and the Arita study (<LINK REF="STD-Makino-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 2010a</LINK>). The Arita study was not a RCT, so we excluded it (<LINK REF="STD-Makino-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Makino 2010b</LINK>). However, the Funagata study had no available data that could be extracted to conduct a meta-analysis. The study reported that the risk of catching the common cold or influenza virus infection was about 3.4 times lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group.</P>
<P>For this update, we included a study considering the effect of probiotics among elderly people (mean age 83 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Fujita-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fujita 2013</LINK>). There were 76 participants in the probiotics group and 78 participants in the placebo group. The results showed that probiotics did not reduce the episode rates of acute URTIs, but did reduce the duration of acute URTIs.</P>
<P>Only three trials were conducted in adults and only one or two trials have adequate data in the subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrese-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vrese 2005</LINK>).

<P>We found four trials conducted in athletes (<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kekkonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kekkonen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>). Participants in two trials trained regularly (predominantly endurance-based activities such as running, cycling, swimming, triathlon, team games and racquet sports) (<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2012</LINK>). They ranged from the recreationally active to Olympic triathletes. In another trial were competitive cyclists (<LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>). One study reported that the URTI symptom incidence was significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2010</LINK>). However, one study, <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2012</LINK>, did not show that probiotics were beneficial in reducing the frequency of URTIs and one study was conducted among marathon runners (<LINK REF="STD-Kekkonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kekkonen 2007</LINK>). The results from the three-month training period stage of the study show that placebo was better than probiotics in reducing the mean duration of an episode of URTI (<LINK REF="STD-Kekkonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kekkonen 2007</LINK>). Another study reported that the effects of probiotic supplementation on URTI load were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>). In the <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>, we only included participants who did normal physical exercise because it is indicated that high-intensity exercise training may affect the effectiveness of the probiotics or immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Witard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witard 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical interpretation of the data</HEADING>
<P>The analyses showed that probiotics were better than placebo in terms of the number of participants who experienced episodes of URTI, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotics used and the number of participants absent from school due to acute URTIs. This was also true for the URTI episode rate, where there was no statistically significant difference observed between the treatment and control groups. The primary outcome of mean duration of an episode of acute URTI was based only on one or two trials in each subgroup. We only found one study that reported school absence due to the common cold; more trials are needed to measure this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Rerksuppaphol-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rerksuppaphol 2012</LINK>). In addition to this, different kinds of probiotics and follow-up periods were used in the trials, so that heterogeneity in some outcomes could not be avoided. We also need to remember that there were not enough data for adults and older people in our review. According to the included trials probiotics are safe and adverse effects are minor. The major side effects of probiotics were gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, flatulence and increased irritability. The limited results showed that probiotic therapy may provide more benefit than placebo in terms of episodes of infection, the duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotics used and cold-related school absence.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the trials included in this review</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was only described in two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fujita-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fujita 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2010</LINK>). Double-blinding was reported in 11 trials and details of the blinding methods were reported in seven trials. However, two trials did not document the type of blinding and four trials did not give details of the double-blinding. All of this could potentially have biased the results in favour of treatment (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>After assessment of the overall quality of the evidence, we downgraded our primary outcomes from high to low or very low quality, usually for unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment and high risk of bias due to funding by related companies. In addition, we also found in some subgroup analyses that there were very small sample sizes and higher levels of statistical heterogeneity, which caused serious inconsistency between the included trials.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-30 13:19:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>In our review, 13 studies met our inclusion criteria. However, we were able to extract data for meta-analysis in 12 of the studies, which may introduce potential bias. On the other hand, we tried our best to identify all the relevant studies and performed analyses base on both ITT population and per-protocol population. These would be helpful in reducing potential bias in the review process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-30 13:23:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>Another systematic review has also focused on <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</I> GG supplementation for preventing respiratory infections among children (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2013</LINK>). Although they only included four RCTs, they found that probiotics have the potential to reduce the incidence of acute otitis media and respiratory infections compared with placebo. Two trials did not separate acute URTIs from the whole respiratory tract. However, the result was similar to this review.</P>
<P>We identified two excluded trials that did not show any benefit of probiotics compared with placebo in the duration or incidence of URTIs (<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kekkonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kekkonen 2007</LINK>). Both trials were performed in endurance athletes; the excessive training may have influenced the effect of the probiotics. We also found one study conducted amongst older people that found that probiotics only can reduce the duration of acute URTIs rather than the number of participants who experienced URTI episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Fujita-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fujita 2013</LINK>). Currently, we have not found any other systematic reviews that conflict with this review. However, there are systematic reviews that focus on the critically ill or ventilator-associated pneumonia patients which, according to the current evidence, have shown less beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Barraud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barraud 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gu 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Currently available low quality evidence shows that probiotics are better than placebo in reducing the number of participants who experience episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate ratio for episodes of acute URTI. Although this review indicates that probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo for preventing acute URTIs, the quality of the current evidence is low.</P>

<P>We have replaced the 'Quality assessment of included studies' in the original version with 'Assessment of risk of bias in included studies' and the methods of analysis according to the new version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We also revised the outcomes and used GRADE to assess the overall quality of the evidence following the instructions in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not include all respiratory tract infections because many studies just reported the respiratory tract infection rather than specifying whether it was a lower or upper respiratory traction infection, which may increase the levels of clinical heterogeneity.</P>

<A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">www.thecochranelibrary.com</A> (accessed 18 May 2011), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to May week 1, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to May 2011), Web of Science, which includes Science Citation Index (from 1900 to May 2011) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (from 1991 to May 2011), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to May 2011), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to May 2011) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to May 2011).</P>
<P>We used the following search strategy to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search strategy with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We adapted the search strategy to search EMBASE; Web of Science and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (see Figure 1).</P>
