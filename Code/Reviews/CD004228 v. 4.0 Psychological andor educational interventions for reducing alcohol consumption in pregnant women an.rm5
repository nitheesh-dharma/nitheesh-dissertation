<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-29 09:44:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many women continue to consume alcohol when they are pregnant. Drinking seven or more standard drinks per week may be harmful, and can cause growth restrictions in babies; binge drinking and heavy alcohol consumption can lead to learning difficulties, behaviour problems and physical disabilities in children. Government policies acknowledge that the occasional drink is not likely to cause harm but that abstinence from alcohol in pregnancy eliminates any possible risks. Psychological and educational interventions (such as supportive counselling sessions and brief educational sessions) may help women to reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy.</P>
<P>Four randomized controlled studies were included in the review; individual studies suggest that educational and counselling interventions may encourage women to abstain from alcohol or reduce the amount of alcohol they drink in pregnancy. The studies involved women who were less than 28 weeks pregnant who were consuming some alcohol. All were carried out in the USA. The interventions ranged from a 10-minute education session and provision of a self-help manual through to an hour-long motivational interview with reinforcement at each prenatal visit. Women in the control groups generally received routine care, which may have included advice on reducing alcohol intake. Outcomes were measured in different ways, and so results have been presented separately for each study. The studies provided very limited information on the effects of interventions on the health of women and their babies.</P>
<P>There was very little information provided in these studies on the effects of interventions on the health of mothers and babies. There is an urgent need for more information in this area.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>It is estimated that more than 20% of pregnant women worldwide consume alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2000</LINK>). Current research suggests that alcohol intake of seven or more standard drinks (one standard drink = 13.6 grams of absolute alcohol) per week during pregnancy places the baby at risk from the negative effects of ethanol (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chudley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chudley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CPS-Statement-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS Statement 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2000</LINK>). However, the effects of alcohol on the fetus are influenced not only by the absolute amount of alcohol consumed, but by the pattern of alcohol consumption (binge drinking versus daily consumption of alcohol), exposure-threshold amounts of alcohol in the blood, as well as the timing of exposure during pregnancy. Factors such as maternal age, health and nutritional status, fetal susceptibility and concurrent use of other psychoactive substances may also influence the outcome on the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Drinking in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Ascertaining the numbers of women drinking alcohol in pregnancy and any associated harm is not simple. Alcohol abuse, particularly in pregnancy, remains a socially stigmatized activity, and surveys of drinking behaviour in pregnancy may underestimate the extent of alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>).  Case control and other studies examining lifestyle behaviours in mothers who have given birth to children with abnormalities may be affected by recall bias (<LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 2004</LINK>). Estimating the amount of alcohol women drink is also complicated and inexact. There is considerable variation in research studies in definitions of what constitutes heavy, moderate or light alcohol consumption. In different studies, alcohol has been measured in grams, other standard units, or in glasses (described as small or large). This is further complicated by the different strengths of different types of alcoholic drink. This leads to very imprecise definitions of light alcohol consumption, such as "a small glass of normal strength wine per day". These variations in measurement mean that it is often difficult to interpret studies examining drinking prevalence, or outcomes associated with drinking varying amounts of alcohol in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surveys in several countries have reported that approximately 15-20% of women continue to drink alcohol throughout pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>).  However, figures may be much higher in the first trimester before pregnancy has been recognized. For example, a telephone survey in Canada reported that 80% of those interviewed said that they consumed alcohol before pregnancy, 50% in the early stages of pregnancy  (before pregnancy recognition) and 18% throughout pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Tough-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tough 2006</LINK>).  Although many women are known to reduce their alcohol consumption during pregnancy, there remain a sizeable minority who continue to drink moderate amounts of alcohol, or indulge in binge drinking. In the Canadian study described, more than 11% of those interviewed reported binge drinking in the early stages of pregnancy.</P>
<P>There is general agreement that binge drinking (more than approximately five units of alcohol on one occasion) and moderate and heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy are harmful; they increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth weight and may lead to serious disorders in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hannigan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannigan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaddoe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaddoe 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mariscal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariscal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterson 1990</LINK>). There is more debate about the adverse effects associated with light consumption and whether women should be advised to abstain from alcohol altogether during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2007</LINK>). A review of the effects of low consumption (defined as less than 12 grams of alcohol per day) concluded that there was only very limited evidence that this level of alcohol consumption was harmful. Risk of miscarriage was slightly higher in women who had consumed small amounts of alcohol, but there was little evidence that premature delivery, low birthweight, preterm delivery or fetal malformations were increased (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2007</LINK>). However, the long-term effects of low alcohol consumption on other outcomes remain unknown and current knowledge has not defined a safe amount of alcohol that can be consumed in pregnancy.</P>
<P>In view of controversy surrounding the benefits of total abstinence, some government policies continue to support light drinking during pregnancy, but several countries have developed guidelines advocating total abstinence from alcohol because of the lack of clarity around threshold effects, and factors contributing to neonatal risks (<LINK REF="REF-ICAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICAP 1999</LINK>). Government policies advocating abstinence do acknowledge that the occasional drink of alcohol during pregnancy will likely result in no harm, but note that abstinence eliminates any possible risk (<LINK REF="REF-ICAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICAP 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">The effects of alcohol in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Studies in both animals and humans have shown the adverse effects associated with heavy alcohol consumption in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Sokol-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 1981</LINK>).  There is some evidence of a dose-response effect (with greater consumption being associated with progressively worse outcomes) although, as we have noted, the findings are less clear with regard to the effects of more limited consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2007</LINK>). A large cohort study in the Netherlands found that the adverse effects of alcohol were not confined to the early stages of pregnancy; alcohol consumption in late pregnancy was also associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, although the authors recognized that the confounding effects of unmeasured lifestyle and socio-economic factors may also have played a part (<LINK REF="REF-Jaddoe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaddoe 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are various physiological mechanisms whereby alcohol causes harm to the developing baby, and many are not well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Goodlett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodlett 2005</LINK>). Alcohol can cross the placental barrier and can directly affect important developmental processes by causing cell damage and disrupting cell functions. It can also have a less direct effect by causing damage to the placenta and other maternal tissues and organs essential to the wellbeing of the developing baby.</P>
<P>Since the early 1970s research has revealed that excessive maternal alcohol consumption (in excess of 80 grams or 8 units of alcohol per day) is associated with an increased risk of a spectrum of disorders in babies and children including serious developmental delay and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hannigan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannigan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaddoe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaddoe 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterson 1990</LINK>). As research has accumulated, the terms used to describe these alcohol-related adverse effects have changed several times, and remain inconsistent between countries and healthcare institutions. Specifically, fetal alcohol syndrome is used to describe a full-blown syndrome, characterized by prenatal or postnatal growth restriction or both, facial anomalies and central nervous system dysfunction. Other clinical manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome may include cardiac anomalies, urogenital defects, skeletal abnormalities, and visual and hearing problems. Partial fetal alcohol syndrome is a term used to describe individuals with only some of the characteristic abnormalities. The term 'fetal alcohol effects' has also been used to describe a partial expression of fetal alcohol syndrome. For example, the presentation may include neurodevelopmental changes and few or no facial anomalies or impaired growth, along with confirmed maternal drinking. Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) describes neurobehavioral pathology and structural central nervous system abnormalities due to in utero alcohol injury. The term alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) is used to describe various malformations and, finally, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder acknowledges that the syndrome is a continuum, with differing degrees of malformations and dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-Statement-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP Statement 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aase-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aase 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Astley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chudley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chudley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CPS-Statement-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS Statement 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenbaum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenbaum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoyme-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoyme 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and its milder variants are around nine per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1997</LINK>), and its effects are lifelong. It is one of the most important causes of serious developmental delay and disability in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2006</LINK>), and <LINK REF="REF-May-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 2007</LINK> has reported particularly high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome in South Africa.</P>
<P>Children with fetal alcohol syndrome often demonstrate poor impulse control, problems in social perception, deficits in higher level receptive and expressive language, poor capacity for abstraction, and problems in memory, attention and judgement (<LINK REF="REF-Coles-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coles 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Randall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sokol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Streissguth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streissguth 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Streissguth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streissguth 1996</LINK>). Other researchers have demonstrated that the long-term effects associated with gestational alcohol exposure may include a higher incidence of mental health problems, disruptive school experience, trouble with the law, substance abuse problems and an increased need for dependent living than the general population. <LINK REF="REF-Stade-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stade 2006</LINK> found that children with fetal alcohol syndrome experienced a significantly lower mean health-related quality of life score (0.47 versus 0.95) when compared with a reference group of children from the general population. The alcohol-affected children demonstrated severe dysfunction on the attributes of cognition and emotion, which reduced their overall quality of life scores. The total costs of caring for children affected by fetal alcohol syndrome in the United States have been estimated to be $74.6 million to $1.6 billion, based on an incidence of 0.33 and 1.99 cases per 1000 live births respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harwood-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harwood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rice-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 1991</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Both pharmacological and psychological/educational strategies to reduce alcohol consumption have been described in the literature. Pharmacological interventions include disulfiram, natrexone and acamprosate (<LINK REF="REF-Harvard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvard 2002</LINK>). Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug used to deter drinking by preventing the liver from fully metabolizing alcohol. It blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage and causes the toxic breakdown product acetaldehyde to accumulate. The combination of disulfiram use and alcohol consumption can lead to extremely unpleasant symptoms including nausea, flushing, headache, high blood pressure, and chest pain. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, reverses the effects of narcotics and reduces the activity of the body's natural opioids, which are stimulated by alcohol as well as narcotics. Individuals who take naltrexone should get less pleasure out of drinking and not want to drink as much. Acamprosate is a calcium channel blocker. It is chemically related to glutamate, the brain's chief excitatory neurotransmitter. When the brain is constantly exposed to alcohol (a sedative that tends to shut down cortical activity) nerve receptors for glutamate compensate by becoming hypersensitive. Acamposate seems to stimulate inhibitory GABA receptors and to antagonize excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate. This helps to prevent some of the pleasurable, reinforcing effects of alcohol use. The effectiveness of disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol abuse has been well described (<LINK REF="REF-Chick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chick 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harvard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Streeton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streeton 2001</LINK>). However, their safety in pregnancy has not been demonstrated, and disulfiram has been associated with limb reduction anomalies when used during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Nora-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nora 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reitnauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitnauer 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Psychological and educational interventions for reducing alcohol use among heavy users have been described. They include educational sessions, motivational enhancement therapy, self-help groups, psychotherapeutic techniques and cognitive-behavioural interventions. Psychological interventions include cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), brief psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and supportive counselling or therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2003</LINK>). Specifically, CBT incorporates core elements of both behavioural and cognitive models. CBT focuses on diminishing the patient's negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional underlying beliefs that evoke unwanted symptoms, through collaborative 'hypothesis-testing', behavioural tasks and skills training (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1962</LINK>). Brief psychodynamic psychotherapy is grounded in psychoanalytic principles and uses the therapeutic relationship to explore and resolve unconscious conflict. The therapeutic goals are development of insight and circumscribed change (<LINK REF="REF-Malan-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malan 1963</LINK>). Interpersonal psychotherapy uses the connection between mood and current interpersonal experiences to focus on four problem areas of grief, role dispute, role transition and interpersonal deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Klerman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerman 1984</LINK>). Supportive counselling is sometimes described as Rogerian person-centred therapy. Rooted in a non-mechanistic philosophy, person-centred therapy is non-manualized and experiential, and core conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuineness are utilized by the therapist within the therapeutic relationship to facilitate the client towards self-awareness and self-determination (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1961</LINK>).</P>
<P>Educational interventions are generally based on social learning theory. Bandura and his colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>) have shown that the application of consequences is not necessary for learning to take place. Learning can therefore occur through the simple processes of observing someone else's activity. This work provided the foundation for Bandura's later work in social cognition. Bandura formulated his findings in a four-step pattern: (1) attention: the individual notices something in the environment; (2) retention: the individual remembers what was noticed; (3) reproduction: the individual copies the action that was noticed; (4) motivation: the environment delivers a consequence that changes the probability that the behavior will be performed again (reinforcement and punishment) (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Price-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1995</LINK>). Educational interventions are less well defined than psychological interventions but include brief educational counselling sessions, structured long-term educational programs with motivational enhancement interventions (greater than five sessions), individual-focused educational strategies, family-focused programs, professional group education interventions and self-help group educational interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Manwell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manwell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schorling-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schorling 1993</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have described the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions to reduce alcohol intake when used in combination with pharmacological interventions or alone (<LINK REF="REF-Ait_x002d_Daoud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ait-Daoud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connors-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2000</LINK>). As pharmacological interventions are contraindicated during pregnancy, psychological and educational interventions have been advocated for reducing alcohol intake among pregnant women or women planning pregnancy. However, their effectiveness has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review aims to examine all trials including pregnant women or women planning for pregnancy which compare psychological and/or educational interventions versus no intervention (or usual care) for reducing the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy.</P>

<P>Six review authors undertook this review, five of whom are content experts. Four authors conducted the additional literature search. Five of the authors screened the studies that were found as a result of this search, discarding the studies that were clearly ineligible but aiming to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Then two authors independently abstracted information from the results sections of the included studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. One author checked and entered the data, all data in tables were then independently rechecked. Where possible, we sought missing data from the authors.</P>
<P>We evaluated studies for methodological quality using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We have described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We have assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups. Again, methods used to take account of missing data have been assessed as adequate, inadequate or unclear; we have assessed attrition above 20% as inadequate even where loss was balanced across groups.</P>

<P>We identified a total of 22 studies for possible inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>Four studies, including 715 pregnant women, met the inclusion criteria and reported on at least one of the outcomes of interest for this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK>).

We have set out details of the participants and descriptions of the interventions and the comparison conditions in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. All included studies combined educational and psychological approaches.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We have presented the assessments of the methodological quality and risk of bias for individual studies in the risk of bias tables attached to the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The risk of bias of included studies was mixed, with none of the studies providing full information about the methods used. We assessed the method of sequence generation as adequate in only one of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK>); the remaining studies did not provide information on this. It was not clear in any of the studies how randomization was achieved and whether there was adequate allocation concealment. Blinding participants and care providers to group allocation for educational and psychological interventions is generally not feasible. Two of the studies report that outcome assessors were not aware of group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK>). The lack of blinding may introduce bias and this should be kept in mind when interpreting results. Levels of attrition were low (less than 10%) in two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK>) but were high in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK> (19% lost to follow up) and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK> (26% attrition, and those lost to follow up were reported as being different in several respects from those remaining in the study). A problem with all of the included studies was that the description of the intervention and comparison conditions and the methods of assessment were not sufficient to allow for study replication; and for all four studies results were not simple to interpret. For this reason, many of the results are reported narratively rather than by analyses.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-01-29 09:44:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria. These included a total of 715 pregnant women, and reported on at least one of the outcomes of interest for this systematic review.</P>
<P>A variety of approaches and comparison groups were used in the four included studies, and different outcomes were measured in different ways at different follow-up points. For these reasons studies have not been combined in meta-analysis; rather, we have presented results separately for each included study.</P>
<P>All four studies included advice on alcohol reduction, but in all cases data on alcohol use were based on self-report rather than being biochemically validated; this is likely to be a source of bias in these studies and should be kept in mind in when interpreting the results.</P>
<P>All four studies recruited women who had either consumed alcohol during the last month or were described as being "at risk" of consuming alcohol during pregnancy based on their responses to an alcohol screening tool.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> study, the intervention consisted of a 45-minute counselling session and women were provided with a self-help manual. The comparison group received no active intervention, but both groups underwent a comprehensive assessment of alcohol related behaviour. In the <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK> study, similarly, women in both the intervention and control groups underwent a comprehensive assessment. In addition, the intervention group took part in a one-hour motivational interview while the control group received a letter describing risks and were referred to their usual care providers. In both the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK> studies, women in the intervention group had shorter interventions (approximately 15 minutes) with follow-up activities or reinforcement, and in both studies control groups received advice to abstain from drinking alcohol as part of their routine antenatal care.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>All four studies reported some measure of abstinence from alcohol following the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> reported that, following the intervention, 69% of the intervention group versus 62% of the control group were abstinent; the difference between groups was not significant (unpublished data) (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.33). <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> also provides figures for abstinence for those women in the intervention and control groups who were abstinent at the initial assessment. Results for this subset of the sample suggest that the intervention had a positive effect in terms of maintaining levels of abstinence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42). Levels of post-intervention abstinence in the <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK> trials are set out in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> respectively (the latter was a cluster-randomized trial and figures were adjusted for unit of randomization). Both of these studies report a positive intervention effect. Similarly, in the <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK>, study more women abstained from alcohol after the intervention, although the evidence of a difference between groups was not statistically significant (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.61).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reduction of alcohol consumption during pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>All four studies included some measure of alcohol reduction in pregnancy, although each trial used a different measure and follow up occurred at different times. (In both the <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK> studies, mean scores were reported but standard deviations (SDs) were not provided; the values for SDs used in the analysis for these outcomes have been calculated from P values set out in the papers.) <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> reported the mean number of drinking episodes during pregnancy; the difference between groups was not statistically significant (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.08). <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1995</LINK> reported the average number of alcoholic drinks per month consumed following the intervention; again, the evidence for a difference between groups was not significant (MD -0.78, 95% CI -1.58 to 0.02). The difference in the number of alcoholic drinks (standard units) at baseline and post intervention for intervention and control groups was not significantly different in the <LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK> study (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK> suggests that a brief intervention was associated with a greater reduction in alcohol consumption in the third trimester compared with the control group (assessment only), although scores were very low in both groups in late pregnancy and there were high levels of attrition in this study (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only limited information was provided on the effects of the interventions on the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK> reported that, after adjustment, the intervention was associated with slightly higher birthweights for babies whose mothers were heavier consumers of alcohol at the initial assessment, but this pattern was reversed for women who initially consumed low amounts of alcohol; for low initial alcohol consumers, babies in the control group were slightly heavier at birth. There was a similar pattern of results for birth length. This study also reported on miscarriages and stillbirth rates in the two groups; there was one miscarriage in the intervention group and two miscarriages and two stillbirths in the control group (these results relate only to those women available at follow up in a study with high rates of attrition). <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> reported that there were no significant differences between groups in terms of birthweights or one- and five-minute Apgar scores.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup and sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We were not able to examine interventions aimed at women planning pregnancy, as none of the included studies focused on such women. We had planned to carry out sensitivity analysis examining the impact of risk of bias on results; however, none of the included studies provided information on allocation concealment and all had other study design characteristics (for example, lack of blinding or high attrition rates) which meant that, overall, all of the included studies were at high risk of bias.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-29 09:44:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focused on the efficacy of interventions for reducing alcohol consumption and did not include other types of substance use, The review includes only randomized control trials; and ensured that the time frame of the search strategy was not limited, but rather extended over 30 years.</P>
<P>To date this systematic review includes only four studies and 715 women and all of the included studies had methodological weaknesses that meant that they were at risk of bias.</P>
<P>The studies included in the review suggest that educational and counselling interventions may encourage women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy. However, for outcomes relating to alcohol consumption, the evidence of a difference between groups was in some cases weak and results were not consistent. Overall, the included studies provided only very limited information on the effects of interventions on the health of women and babies.</P>
<P>The evidence on reductions in consumption and abstinence in the included studies was all based on self-reported drinking levels (although in one study there was an attempt to corroborate accounts by questioning (with the woman's permission) significant others (<LINK REF="STD-Handmaker--1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Handmaker 1999a</LINK>). As we acknowledged in the introduction, consuming alcohol in pregnancy is a socially stigmatized activity in many cultures, and results based on self-reported behaviour may exaggerate the positive effects of interventions. Evidence from smoking cessation trials has demonstrated that biochemically validated quit rates following interventions tend to be lower than those based on self-report (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Drawing conclusions on the overall effects of interventions was difficult, as the interventions included were different (ranging from 10 minutes through to a structured hour-long interview with reinforcement at subsequent visits). It was also difficult to assess the impact of interventions within the individual trials, as it was not always clear what the comparison groups received. In the <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1999</LINK> study, it was reported that women in the control group received no active intervention, but it was not clear whether women received any advice as part of routine care. In the remaining three studies, women in the control groups received some advice encouraging them to reduce their alcohol intake, and in all four studies women in both groups underwent lengthy assessments of their alcohol consumption behaviour, which itself may have had some effect.</P>
<P>The included studies all recruited women who reported that they had consumed some alcohol since the beginning of pregnancy or who were screened as being "at risk" of consuming alcohol in pregnancy by their positive responses to an alcohol screening tool. However, many of the women included had already stopped drinking by the time they were recruited to the studies (although they may well have drunk alcohol before pregnancy confirmation). Of those that continued to drink, although the groups may have included some moderate and heavy drinkers, the average levels of alcohol consumption tended to be relatively low (less than approximately one drink each day). Further, as pregnancy progressed, drinking levels tended to decrease in both the intervention and control groups. This pattern reflects that described in observational studies of lifestyle behaviour changes in pregnancy; with reductions in drinking once pregnancy has been recognized. It is also possible that the screening interviews diluted the intervention effect as it may also have had an impact on behaviour in both the intervention and control groups. Under these circumstances, where baseline drinking levels are relatively low and where many women reduce their alcohol consumption during pregnancy irrespective of any specific intervention, large studies are needed to identify meaningful differences in drinking behaviour between groups.</P>
<P>The main conclusion of this review is that overall there is very little evidence about the effects of educational and psychological interventions aiming to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy, and in particular, on the effect of such interventions on the health of women and babies. The lack of evidence from trials in this area is very surprising to us, given that heavy alcohol consumption increases risk of serious harm (fetal alcohol syndrome being an important cause of severe developmental delay). While this subject has received so little research attention, modification of other lifestyle factors in pregnancy has been the focus of a great deal of research. The Cochrane review of interventions to reduce smoking includes 64 trials carried out in different settings and countries, and using a variety of strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2004</LINK>). The four studies included in this review were all carried out in the USA, which raises the question of their generalizability to other settings. There is an urgent need for more research on this topic.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-01-09 10:16:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individual studies suggest that psychological and educational interventions may result in increased abstinence from alcohol among pregnant women. However, the paucity of studies and number of total participants does not allow us to determine the overall effectiveness of psychological and/or educational interventions for reducing prenatal consumption of alcohol among pregnant women, or women planning pregnancy. While some benefits to babies were reported, overall there was very little information provided on health outcomes for mothers and babies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-22 10:11:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the current systematic review highlight the need for further research. A large multi-centred double-blinded randomized trial measuring relevant outcomes (including reduction of alcohol consumption during pregnancy to less than seven standard drinks a week; abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy, adverse effects and/or benefits to the mother and neonatal outcomes) must be conducted. The trial must overcome the methodological limitations of past trials.</P>
