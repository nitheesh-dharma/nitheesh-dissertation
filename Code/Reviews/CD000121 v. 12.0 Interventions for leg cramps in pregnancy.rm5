<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sodium supplements may decrease the number of cramp attacks experienced by women in pregnancy but the effect is slight. Calcium is of no benefit. The evidence of benefit for magnesium is stronger. Multivitamin and mineral supplements also seem to help but the relevance of this is unclear as the preparation used contained twelve separate constituents and it is not possible to discover which of these was effective, or indeed if there was synergy between constituents. There is a theoretical risk that sodium supplementation could raise blood pressure. It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation would be harmful at the suggested doses.</P>

Placebo controlled trials of multivitamin with mineral supplements (odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence intervals 0.05 to 1.01) and magnesium (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence intervals 0.05 to 0.60) provided some suggestion of benefit. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-26 11:46:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The evidence that calcium reduces cramp is weak and seems to depend on placebo effect. The evidence for sodium chloride is stronger but the results of the sodium chloride trial may no longer be relevant because of dietary changes which include an increased sodium intake in the general population. It is not possible to recommend multivitamins with mineral supplementation, as it is not clear which ingredient, if any, is helping. If a woman finds cramp troublesome in pregnancy, the best evidence is for magnesium lactate or citrate taken as 5mmol in the morning and 10mmol in the evening.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-04 21:16:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Leg cramps are a common problem in the second half of pregnancy, experienced by up to half of pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Salvatore-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvatore 1961</LINK>). They can be particularly troublesome at night. The mechanism is unclear but leg cramps occur in fit and healthy people such as athletes. Nor is it clear why they should occur more commonly in pregnancy, becoming more so as pregnancy progresses. Possible mechanisms which have been suggested are: slowed venous return resulting from raised intra abdominal pressure with progesterone decreasing the tone in the venous musculature and nutritional deficiencies brought about by the demands of the growing fetus. The pain seems to be caused by a build up of lactic and pyruvic acids leading to involuntary contraction of the affected muscles, usually in the legs. Though cramp causes no lasting damage to muscle, it can be very painful and, unfortunately is very much more common at night in bed. It is a common experience that getting out of bed, walking around, stretching and massaging the affected muscle(s) seems to be helpful, possibly by dispersing the build up of acids.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-10-26 11:51:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The methodological quality of these trials is only moderate. In the <LINK REF="STD-Hammar-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hammar 1981</LINK> paper, calcium treatment was compared with no treatment, rather than with placebo. Given this is the only one of the three trials using calcium which showed a positive result, it is likely that this result is due to a placebo effect. <LINK REF="STD-Hammar-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hammar 1987</LINK> used vitamin C as placebo. Both of these were small studies with totals of 42 and 60 patients respectively. In neither study is the method of randomization described. In neither is there any discussion of adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1947</LINK> used an elaborate methodology to compare calcium and sodium chloride with placebo and saccharin. Allocation of the 198 participants was by alternation; problems with the taste of sodium chloride led the investigator to change the formulation in the course of the study. The dose of sodium chloride began as 60g of powder but the taste was obvious and later three 15g tablets were used. The author states that sodium chloride "has no ill effects ". There is no further discussion of any possible adverse effects except to record that the taste of the powder was unacceptable hence the switch to tablets. <LINK REF="STD-Thauvin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Thauvin 1992</LINK> seemed mainly interested in studying the effects of mineral supplements on zinc and copper levels through pregnancy. The information on cramp occupies only seven lines in the study. Only 27 women out of the 60 who began in the trial were assessed for cramp at the end of their pregnancies. Twelve ingredients (see table of included studies), something of a witch's brew, made up the tablets and it is not possible to know which, if any, of these helped. The method of randomization is not described. Adverse effects are not mentioned. The magnesium versus placebo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dahle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahle 1995</LINK>) is the best study in this review though the method of randomization is again not described. Seventy three women began the study and only four dropped out. The study assessed the women after three weeks of treatment. There was no further follow-up. Side effects are described as infrequent, mainly slight nausea. One woman taking the placebo gave up because of severe nausea. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-10-26 11:52:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Five trials involving 352 women were included. The trials were of moderate quality. (Five reports from an updated search in October 2009 have been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.) Calcium (mainly as calcium lactate) stopped leg cramps in all but 21 of 99 women compared with 39 of 108 women given either no treatment or placebo (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.83). However, there was significant heterogeneity between these results and if the trial of 42 women comparing calcium with no treatment is excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Hammar-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hammar 1981</LINK>) i.e. where the benefit may have been a placebo effect, calcium was effective in stopping cramp in all but 19 of 78 women, compared with 19 of 87 given placebo, i.e. there is clear evidence of no benefit. One trial of 150 women comparing sodium chloride with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1947</LINK>) showed a possible reduction in leg cramps: 13 of 57 women given placebo were unchanged or their cramps recurred, compared with 13 of 93 women given sodium chloride, (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.29). If recurrences of cramp after treatment ended are excluded, sodium chloride does seem to be effective as only one woman in 93 given sodium chloride did not benefit, compared with 13 of 57 given placebo or no treatment. The same trial, this time involving 141 women (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1947</LINK>), showed no difference between calcium and sodium chloride (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence intervals 0.47 to 3.27). Multivitamin and mineral supplements may have an effect (<LINK REF="STD-Thauvin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Thauvin 1992</LINK>), two of 11 women given supplements still had cramp at term compared with 10 of 18 given placebo (odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence intervals 0.05 to 1.01) but it is not clear which of twelve ingredients, if any, was the active one. For magnesium, the evidence that it can reduce cramp is stronger (<LINK REF="STD-Dahle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahle 1995</LINK>). Twenty three women of 34 given magnesium still had some cramp compared with 33 of 35 given placebo (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence intervals 0.05 to 0.60 ). The trial only assessed symptoms after three weeks of treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given the frequency of leg cramps in pregnancy it is surprising how little research has been done. Only two studies of acceptable quality have been published in the past 20 years. The causes of cramp are not understood, nor why it becomes so much more common through pregnancy. This does not help the rational search for prevention and treatment. Salt loss in heat was implicated in cramp in miners and salt was added to beer, anecdotally, as treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1947</LINK> gave salt supplements to pregnant women who had cramps. The dose (45 to 60g) seems today very large. There was evidence of benefit but if recurrence of cramp on stopping treatment is taken into consideration (which it was not in previous versions of this review) then the benefit appears much less. The average intake of salt is higher today than it was in UK in 1946 when Robinson carried out her trial. Given that sodium chloride can raise blood pressure it does not seem right to recommend sodium chloride as a treatment for cramp in pregnancy except perhaps in countries where the daily intake is low. Given the marked differences in the effect of calcium when compared with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hammar-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hammar 1981</LINK>) and calcium when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Hammar-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hammar 1987</LINK>), it is more likely that calcium has no effect other than that of placebo and cannot therefore be recommended.<BR/>
<BR/>Multivitamins with minerals (<LINK REF="STD-Thauvin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Thauvin 1992</LINK>) may help cramp but the effect was small as was the trial and, as the product contained 12 separate ingredients, no particular constituent can be recommended.</P>
<P>The magnesium lactate/citrate study ( <LINK REF="STD-Dahle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahle 1995</LINK>) is important because it was well carried out. It shows a clear though modest benefit with extra magnesium. It also shows that there is a marked placebo effect on the frequency of leg cramps which should make anyone wary of trials which are not placebo controlled or are not properly blinded e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Mauss-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Mauss 1970</LINK>.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-26 11:53:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence that calcium supplementation is not effective in the treatment of pregnant women who suffer cramp in pregnancy. Sodium chloride when given in high doses in 1945-1946 was found to be helpful by most women but there was a high relapse rate on stopping treatment, and there may be an adverse effect on blood pressure from taking such high doses (45-60g daily). It is possible that one or more of the ingredients in the multivitamin/mineral tablet helps cramp but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use. Only with magnesium is there clear evidence of benefit: 5mmol of magnesium as a mixture of lactate and citrate in the morning and 10mmol in the evening will stop some women having cramp, and will reduce the frequency of attacks in some other women.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-26 11:53:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>No further research is needed on calcium supplementation. It does not work for cramp in pregnancy. More research on sodium chloride would be helpful as there is only one paper published on this treatment, in 1947. It would be helpful to know what is the minimum effective dose, and, whether this has any impact on maternal blood pressure and, if it does, whether that matters. The possible benefit of the multivitamin/mineral treatment may have been due to magnesium. If further research is carried out on dietary supplements it should be on one constituent at a time initially so it can be seen if any particular supplement is helpful on its own before any possible synergy between supplements is looked for. Venostasin (see <LINK REF="STD-Mauss-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Mauss 1970</LINK>) may merit further research but this will need to be properly randomized and fully blinded given the likelihood of a large placebo effect in the treatment of this condition.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Mauss-1970">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a cross-over trial (not in itself a reason for exclusion from this review) examining the effect of Venostasin (horse chestnut extract), but the study was only single-blinded. The reasons given for the single blinding seem inadequate (that women would have failed to take the tablets properly if unsupervised). There is a strong suspicion that the lack of blinding influenced the results: no placebo effect was noted, a very unlikely result in this subject.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Abstract:<BR/>The conclusion does not follow from the review.</P>
<P>Background:<BR/>Discussion of current hypotheses about the causes of leg cramps in pregnancy would be helpful, as would a description of the natural history of the cramps. The second sentence should begin "They" or Cramps".</P>
<P>Objectives:<BR/>Treatments would be a better term than preparations, and consistent with the abstract.</P>
<P>Characteristics of included studies:<BR/>More information about the study design would be helpful, and if this is not available information about the comparability of the groups should be presented. Details of how calcium and sodium was given should be included. The dose of 45g sodium chloride is very high, is it correct? Information about any adverse effects, how cramps were reported and any losses to follow up would be helpful.</P>
<P>Implications for practice:<BR/>The comments on massage and stretching would be more appropriate in the background, and references would be helpful.</P>
<P>Implications for research:<BR/>How would the data in the review influence the design of the suggested sodium chloride trial?</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>In the magnesium trial did the stage of pregnancy have any relation to the effectiveness of magnesium? </P>
<P>It would be interesting to give more background about magnesium. Why was it tried? How might it work? Now we know that magnesium sulphate helps prevent eclampsia, has anyone ever suggested a connection between cramp and pre-eclampsia?</P>
<P>Since the trials of calcium were clearly heterogeneous, as is noted under Results, a meta-analysis is misleading and unjustified. The diamond giving a combined result should be deleted.</P>
