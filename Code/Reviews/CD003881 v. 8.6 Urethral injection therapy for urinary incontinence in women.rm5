<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-24 16:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stress incontinence is losing urine when coughing, laughing, sneezing or exercising. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on managing the symptoms. Usually muscles and tissue form a cushion supporting the base of the bladder and closing the urethra (the passage through which urine leaves the body). If they do not, artificial cushioning can be created by injecting bulking agents into the area around the urethra. The review of 14 trials, which included 2004 women, found some limited evidence that this can relieve stress incontinence in women. Other treatments such as surgery might be better. Using the women's own fat tissue as the agent injected can cause serious complications. In terms of costs, a brief review of economic studies suggested that collagen injection was less costly than surgery when used as first treatment or after initial surgery failure.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-17 20:33:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Excluding duplicate reports, we identified 14 trials (excluding one that was subsequently withdrawn from publication and not included in this analysis) including 2004 women that met the inclusion criteria. The limited data available were not suitable for meta-analysis because they all came from separate trials. Trials were small and generally of moderate quality.</P>
<P>One trial of 45 women that compared injection therapy with conservative treatment showed early benefit for the injectable therapy with respect to continence grade (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.94) and quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.54, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92). Another trial, comparing Injection of autologous fat with placebo, terminated early because of safety concerns. Two trials that compared injection with surgical management found significantly better objective cure in the surgical group (RR 4.77, 95% CI 1.96 to 11.64; and RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79), although the latter trial data did not reach statistical significance if an intention-to-treat analysis was used.</P>
<P>Eight trials compared different agents and all results had wide confidence intervals. Silicone particles, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol, carbon spheres and dextranomer hyaluronic acid combination gave improvements which were not shown to be more or less efficacious than collagen. Dextranomer hyaluronic acid compound treated patients appeared to have significantly higher rates of injection site complications (16% with the hyaluronic acid compound versus none with collagen; RR 37.78, 95% CI 2.34 to 610.12) and this product has now been withdrawn from the market.</P>
<P>A comparison of periurethral and transurethral methods of injection found similar outcomes but a higher (though not statistically significant) rate of early complications in the periurethral group. One trial of 30 women showed a weak (but not clinically significant) advantage for patient satisfaction (data not suitable for analysis in RevMan) after mid-urethral injection in comparison to bladder neck injection but with no demonstrable difference in continence levels.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-17 16:30:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. In addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. One small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. Greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. No clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. There is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. The single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side effects. Also, a Brief Economic Commentary (BEC) identified three studies suggesting that urethral bulking agent might be more cost-effective compared with retropubic mid-urethral slings, transobturator or traditional sling procedure when used as an initial treatment in women without hypermobility or as a follow-up to surgery failure provided injection is kept minimal. However, urethral bulking agent might not be cost-effective when compared with traditional sling as an initial treatment of SUI when a patient is followed up for a longer period (15 months post-surgery).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-21 12:20:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is part of a series of Cochrane reviews on the effects of surgical treatment for urinary incontinence. This is an update of a review on periurethral injection therapy previously published by the Cochrane Incontinence Group in 2007. The reader is referred to another review in the series by Glazener (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004</LINK>) for background information regarding the description of urinary incontinence, the principal categories of incontinence, and the broad options for management.</P>
<P>Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) constitutes a huge financial economic burden to the society. In the USA, the annual total direct costs of urinary incontinence in both men and women is over USD 16 billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>) with a societal cost of USD 26.2 billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1998</LINK>). Approximately, USD 13.12 billion (1995 USD) of the total direct costs of urinary incontinence is spent on SUI (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>). About 70% of this USD 13.12 billion is borne by the patients mainly through routine care (purchasing pads, disposable underwear (diapers), laundry and dry cleaning). This constitutes a significant individual financial burden. Of the remaining 30%, 14% is spent on nursing home admission, 9% on treatment, 6% on addressing complications and 1% on diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>). A study reported that about 1% of the median annual household income ( USD 50,000 to USD 59,999 in 2006) was spent by women on incontinence management. This study estimated that women spent an annual mean cost of USD 751 to USD 1277(2006 USD) on incontinence. This cost increases based on the severity of the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Subak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subak 2008</LINK>).The indirect cost associated exerts a social and psychological burden which is unquantifiable. (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, <LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2004</LINK> estimated that the annual average direct medical costs of SUI for one year (1998 USD) was USD 5,642 and USD 4,208 for indirect workplace costs. The cost of management and treatment of SUI appears to have increased over time due to increasing prevalence and increased desire for improved quality of life. This in turn has resulted from improved recognition of the condition, as well as increased use of surgical and non-surgical management procedures.</P>
<P>Surgical procedures designed to treat urinary incontinence generally aim to improve support to the vesico-urethral junction and correct deficient urethral closure. The precise mechanism whereby differing procedures improve continence continues to be a matter of debate, making selection of the most appropriate option for an individual difficult. The surgeon's preference, co-existing urogenital problems, anatomical features of the bladder outlet and co-morbidity suffered by the patient can all influence the choice of procedure. Numerous surgical methods have been described which can be subdivided into seven main categories:</P>

<LI>laparoscopic colposuspension (<LINK REF="REF-Dean-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 2006</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>This review focused on the effectiveness of periurethral or transurethral injection therapy. The alternative surgical approaches are considered in other reviews as referenced.</P>
<P>Urethral mucosal coaptation (that is the urethral lining lying in such a way that there is closure of the urethral lumen at rest) is encouraged by properties of the mucosa itself, the presence of submucosal vascular cushions and activity of smooth muscle elements. It is considered to be an important component of the mechanism of urinary continence in women. The injection of bulking agents into the urethral submucosa is designed to create artificial urethral cushions that can improve urethral coaptation and hence restore continence.</P>
<P>Due to the short length and relative accessibility of the female urethra, the technique for administering urethral bulking agents by injection for treatment of stress incontinence is relatively simple and can be achieved under local anaesthesia. The agent is injected into the submucosa at two or more sites at the same level of the proximal urethra under endoscopic control. Traditionally this has been at a level just distal to the bladder neck but more recently, as a consequence of surgical experience with minimally invasive mid-urethral tapes, the latter site has also been used. The needle for injection can either be advanced transurethrally through the urethroscope or periurethrally via small perineal incisions. The viscous nature of the agents currently used requires a high pressure injection device. Endoscopic control is essential to ensure accurate placement of the substance into the submucosal layer and to demonstrate adequate expansion. The use of local anaesthesia allows an immediate check on the adequacy of coaptation by asking the patient to cough or perform a Valsalva manoeuvre (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The nature of the bulking agent utilised may also vary the effect. Ideally, a urethral bulking agent should be non-immunogenic and biocompatible, leading to minimal inflammatory and fibrotic response. The particles that make up the agent should be of sufficient size to prevent migration away from the site of injection (diameter greater than 80 µm) and of sufficient durability to maintain their effect over time. Potential local side effects include urinary tract infection, urinary retention, local pain, pseudo-abscess formation and urethral erosion. Distant effects as a result of particle migration are generally site specific and include pulmonary embolism. In the case of an immunogenic agent there remains the possibility of a non-specific systemic response. Generally, the agents currently available consist of particles suspended in a bio-degradable carrier gel. They include the following.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Autologous fat</HEADING>
<P>Use of an agent harvested from the patient would be attractive in terms of the reduction in immunogenicity. Fat cells harvested from the abdominal wall by suction are washed and re-suspended in saline prior to injection. Rapid digestion and potential migration of this material has halted further development of this option (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Carbon beads (Durasphere&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>This agent consists of carbon-coated zirconium beads suspended in a polysaccharide carrier gel and was designed to have minimal risk of migration and to be durable (<LINK REF="REF-Lightner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lightner 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) (Coaptite&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>Coaptite&#8482; consists of calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) spherical particles and an aqueous gel carrier (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2007</LINK>). As a normal constituent of bone it is non-immunogenic and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of intrinsic sphincter deficiency in 2005.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) (Uryx&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>Uryx&#8482; consists of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) in a dimethyl sulphoxide carrier (<LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2004</LINK>). It was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Bard in 2006, two years after its introduction, possibly as a result of reported high rates of urethral erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Hurtado-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurtado 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen (Contigen&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>Glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen (GAX-collagen) is formed by cross-linking bovine dermal collagen with glutaraldehyde and dispersing it in phosphate-buffered physiological saline (<LINK REF="REF-Chaliha-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaliha 1995</LINK>). GAX-collagen contains at least 95% of type I collagen and 1% to 5% of type III collagen. A skin test must be performed prior to injecting GAX-collagen to detect a hypersensitivity reaction. Late complications have included delayed skin reactions and arthralgia as well as more serious complications such as pulmonary embolism and osteitis pubis. It remains the most widely used injectable, worldwide, and was used as the control arm in the majority of trials included in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hyaluronic acid with dextranomer (Zuidex&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>This combination of a hydrophilic dextran polymer in a non-animal stabilised hyaluronic acid base has been used extensively in the treatment of paediatric reflux with an excellent safety profile. It has been marketed as Zuidex&#8482; for injection via a novel Implacer&#8482; device designed to deliver four injections of the bulking agent at mid-urethral level without the need for cystoscopic guidance. Concerns about high levels of pseudo-abscess formation have led to its withdrawal from the market (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Permacol&#8482; consists of non-reconstituted porcine dermal collagen. Non-collagenous material, except elastin, is removed from porcine dermis and a cross-linking process performed. The implanted collagen retains its original three-dimensional structural architecture. This can provide a permanent support for the in-growth of new tissue. In contrast to GAX-collagen, this product is non-allergenic (Tissue Science Laboratories plc).</P>

<P>Polytetrafluoroethylene (Polytef&#8482;) is produced by the pyrolysis of Teflon&#8482;. The bulking agent that is used for injection therapy is a paste comprising polytetrafluoroethylene, glycerine and polysorbate (<LINK REF="REF-Chaliha-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaliha 1995</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Silicon particles (Macroplastique&#8482;)</HEADING>
<P>Macroplastique&#8482;, a silicone polymer, is one of the more recent injectable treatments to be studied (<LINK REF="REF-Chaliha-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaliha 1995</LINK>). It is made from highly textured poly-dimethyl-siloxane macro particles suspended within a bio-excretable carrier hydrogel of polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone or PVP). The majority of the solid particles are greater than 100 µm in diameter, reducing the risk of migration. It has recently been approved by the FDA for use as an intra-urethral bulking agent.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Experimental agents</HEADING>
<P>The search for bulking agents that fulfil the ideal criteria continues. The synthetic agents silicone micro balloons and alginate gels together with autologous chondrocytes and autologous myoblasts have been the subject of phase I and phase II studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lightner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lightner 2002</LINK>). More recently, Strasser has published two papers on clinical studies of the latter (<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 2007</LINK>), but one of these (which would have been eligible for inclusion in this review) has subsequently been withdrawn by the publishers, putting into question the validity of the results of both. Carr and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 2009</LINK>) also used autologous muscle-derived cells in 29 women with stress incontinence, with a good safety profile, but did not include a non-treatment arm in the study. A further study has recently been published of 12 women with previous failed surgical management of stress incontinence, which suggests that autologous myoblast injection is a safe and promising second-line therapy (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e8_be-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sèbe 2011</LINK>). It is to be hoped that further well-designed randomised controlled trials will be set up in the future.</P>

<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Incontinence Review Group. Relevant trials were identified from the Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, which is described under the Incontinence Group's details in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>.) The register contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, CINAHL and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. There are no language or other restrictions imposed on inclusion in the Specialised Register. The date of the most recent search of the register for this review was 8 November 2010.</P>
<P>The trials in the Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL. The terms used to search the Incontinence Group Trials Register are given below:<BR/>({TOPIC.URINE.INCON*}) AND ({DESIGN.CCT*} OR {DESIGN.RCT*}) AND (INTVENT.SURG.INJECTIONS*)<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 12, Thomson Reuters).</P>

<P>The titles, and where possible the abstracts, of all studies identified by the searches were appraised by two review authors (VK,TP in this update; see contributions of authors section for details for the original review and first update) to ascertain those likely to contain data concerning the effectiveness of injection therapy. The review authors, without prior consideration of the results, evaluated the full reports of all possibly eligible studies for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion. The assessment of risk of bias was undertaken by each review author using explicit criteria set by Cochrane. These include quality of random allocation and concealment, description of dropouts and withdrawals, analysis by intention-to-treat, and 'blinding' during treatment and at outcome assessment. Data extraction was undertaken independently by at least two review authors. Where data may have been collected but not reported, clarification was sought directly from the investigators.</P>
<P>Trial data were analysed as described in the <I>Cochrane</I> <I>Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). For binary outcomes, the number of participants reporting an outcome was related to the number at risk in each group to derive the risk ratio (RR). For continuous variables, we used the mean and standard deviation to derive a mean difference (MD). When appropriate, meta-analysis was planned using a fixed-effect model with the 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated. Differences between trials was to be further investigated when significant heterogeneity (test of heterogeneity at 10% significance level) was found or appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results.</P>
<P>If data were available, we planned to group trial data by type of incontinence (urodynamic stress incontinence due to hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency based on urodynamic diagnosis, or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) based on symptom classification).</P>
<P>Any differences of opinion related to study inclusion, methodological quality or data extraction were resolved by discussion amongst the review authors, and, when necessary, referred to a third party for arbitration.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded from the review if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment for urinary incontinence, or if they made comparisons other than those prespecified. Excluded studies are listed with reasons given for their exclusion.</P>

<P>This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2001</LINK>), used a continence questionnaire to assess quality of life without reference to validity testing. For the treatment group, the mean continence questionnaire score fell from 13.2 pretreatment to 10.9 (17% reduction) after treatment. The mean score for the placebo group was 12.9 before intervention and 12.2 after injection (5% reduction); this result was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-07-21 12:28:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified 14 eligible trials that addressed all of the pre stated hypotheses, and also identified an additional trial that addressed a hypothesis that had not been pre stated concerning the route of injection. Two of the trials identified have, as yet, only been published in abstract form with limited original data. These authors have been contacted to ascertain their intentions for full publication or personal communication of complete data. Of the nine remaining trials, one was closed before full recruitment. The small number of trials identified, together with the paucity of published data meant that few data could be tabulated. All analyses had wide confidence intervals indicating considerable uncertainty.</P>
<P>To supplement the main systematic review of effects, we sought to identify economic evaluations which have compared periurethral or transurethral injection with each of the comparators listed in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>. Details of the search strategies are given in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.The supplementary search in NHS EED, MEDLINE and Embase identified three such economic evaluations (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oremus-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oremus 2003</LINK>) that compared urethral injection with other surgical managements. No study was found for the other comparators.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 01: urethral injection therapy is better than no treatment</HEADING>
<P>No further publications have been identified since the last update. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2001</LINK>) compared periurethral injection of autologous fat with placebo injection of saline. The trial was complicated by the death of a participant from fat embolism three days following her second injection. The investigators subsequently elected to terminate the trial with 56 participants rather than recruit the originally planned sample of 90 women. The methodology of the trial appeared sound but early termination meant that it had less power than intended. The trial found no difference in subjective or objective outcome measures between the two groups suggesting that periurethral injection of autologous fat is no more effective than saline injection for the treatment of urodynamically defined stress incontinence. The poor efficacy and unsatisfactory safety profile of autologous fat injection demonstrated by this trial has resulted in this agent being no longer used for urethral bulking. The lack of change in urodynamic parameters suggests that the technique did not achieve an increase in urethral opening pressure. The improvement in pad weight following saline injection that was found in this trial does suggest that a placebo arm should be present in future trials of urethral bulking agents.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 02: urethral injection therapy is better than conservative management</HEADING>
<P>Since this review was last updated in 2007, a comparative trial of urethral bulking agent injection with the present standard of conservative treatment, pelvic floor muscle training, has now been published (<LINK REF="STD-ter-Meulen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ter Meulen 2009</LINK>). Macroplastique&#8482; appears to show an advantage over home pelvic floor exercises at three months but it is not known if this benefit is sustained in the medium to long term. This needs to be balanced against the relatively high incidence of adverse events (retention in 73% and dysuria in 47%). No relevant economic evidence was identified for the Brief Economic Commentary (BEC).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 03: urethral injection therapy is better than other surgical managements</HEADING>
<P>No further publications have been identified since the last update. Two trials tested this hypothesis (<LINK REF="STD-Corcos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Corcos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the paper by Corcos (<LINK REF="STD-Corcos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Corcos 2005</LINK>), there was a relatively high number of post randomisation dropouts in the open surgery group who were not included in the data analysis (19%) and this could have introduced bias. Overall, surgery was more effective than collagen injection although 50% of women in the latter group were satisfied at 12 months following injection. The investigators felt that urethral bulking with collagen may represent a worthwhile first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) because it is associated with a lower complication rate. This trial did not report longer-term follow-up although experimental trials suggest that injected collagen is degraded over a two-year period.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Maher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2005</LINK>, a clear advantage in objective cure (defined as no urinary leakage due to stress urinary incontinence on repeat urodynamics) was demonstrated at six months for pubovaginal sling (81%, 17 out of 21) versus transurethral Macroplastique&#8482; (9%, two out of 22). Injection therapy was also noted to be more expensive than surgery in this trial. Advantages for injection therapy were lower morbidity with equivalent symptomatic and patient satisfaction rates at six-month follow-up. At five years, 69% (nine out of 13) of patients were satisfied with sling surgery versus 29% (four out of 14) of those who received Macroplastique&#8482;. There was, however, only a 60% long-term follow-up rate in this trial so this finding must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evidence</HEADING>
<P>The surgical managements compared with urethral injection therapy were traditional suburethral sling, retropubic mid-urethral slings and transobturator mid-urethral slings, In a comparative cost-analysis of a retrospective observational study conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Berman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1997</LINK> in the USA, traditional suburethral sling procedure was compared with transurethral collagen injection in women with SUI. Women were followed up for 15 months post-surgery and 71% of the traditional slings arm were symptom-free compared with 27% in the collagen injection arm (P = 0.05). The average cost per woman treated with the traditional sling procedure was USD 10,382 (1995 USD) while the collagen injection was USD 4996 (1995 USD) (P &lt; 0.001). Although the cost of the traditional sling is double that of the collagen injection, the study authors argued that traditional suburethral retropubic sling procedure is more cost-effective than collagen injection due to its higher effectiveness. A cost-utility analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK> (decision model) compared urethral bulking agent with retropubic mid-urethral slings and transobturator mid-urethral slings in patient with SUI without urethral hypermobility (<LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>). The study utilised data from different randomised controlled trials (RCTs) obtained from PubMed search of women with SUI and treatment with urethral bulking agent and adopted the perspective of the healthcare in the USA. The study time horizon was one year and assumed that transobturator and retropubic are equivalent in treatment based upon the study reports identified. The treatment cost for urethral bulking agent was USD 1237 to USD 1512 while mid-urethral sling (transobturator or retropubic) cost USD 5757 to USD 7036(2013 USD). Mid-urethral sling was USD 436,465 (2013 USD) more expensive than urethral bulking agent for every 100 women treated. The study reported that the probability of recurrent SUI was 18% with mid-urethral sling (transobturator or retropubic), while the probability of re-injection was 48%, with 34% of those initially receiving treatment with a urethral bulking agent needing another form of treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of mid-urethral slings compared with bulking agent was USD 70,400 (2013 USD) per utility (health quality) gained. The study assumed a willingness to pay of USD 50, 000 (2013 USD) per utility gained, leading to the authors conclusion that mid-urethral sling was not cost-effective as a first-line treatment. However, further analysis estimated that the urethral bulking agent had only a 48% chance of being cost-effective and a 52% chance of being cost-saving compared to mid-urethral slings women with SUI without urethral hypermobility. <LINK REF="REF-Oremus-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oremus 2003</LINK> reported a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision tree model from the health care system perspective of Ontario and Quebec. Three different surgeries (retropubic suspension, transobturator suspension, and traditional sling procedure) were compared with collagen injection in women with SUI after failure of initial surgical treatment. The time horizon of the model (equivalent to the follow-up in a trial) was one year. The study used clinical data from a systematic review and a physician survey and concluded that all surgeries were more successful than collagen injection but were more expensive. Collagen injection had the lowest average cost per patient. The average cost of two collagen injections was CAD 2695 in Ontario and CAD 2718 in Quebec (1998 Canadian dollars). In Ontario, retropubic suspension, transobturator suspension and traditional sling cost CAD 3257, CAD 4024 and CAD 4657 (1998 Canadian dollars), respectively while in Quebec, retropubic suspension, transobturator suspension and traditional sling cost CAD 3490, CAD 3494 and CAD 3118 (1998 Canadian dollars), respectively. The authors argued that any of the surgeries would be cost-effective only when hospital stay was short. The study thus concluded that collagen injection may be more cost-effective as a follow-up treatment to initial surgical failure in both Ontario and Quebec, when injection is kept minimal, otherwise, surgery may be cost-effective.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 04: one material for injection therapy is better than another</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials were identified that addressed this hypothesis. Seven trials tested a newer agent against the established agent, cross-linked bovine collagen.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 2001</LINK>) suggested that carbon particles were as effective as collagen at 12 months with approximately 66% of participants gaining symptomatic benefit. Carbon injection did however cause a higher frequency of transient side effects. The report was based on an interim analysis and a full report is still awaited. The methodology did, however, appear sound. <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2002</LINK> also compared carbon particles with collagen and assessed patients more than a year from treatment (32.3 months). It showed a trend towards a better outcome in favour of carbon particles however, again this was not found to be statistically significant.</P>
<P>The two trials comparing silicone particles and collagen were not suitable for combination in a meta-analysis but <LINK REF="STD-Ghoniem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghoniem 2009</LINK> showed a significantly better outcome with regard to cure and symptom improvement for silicone particles, with no increase in adverse events. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Anders-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Anders 2002</LINK> was obtained from a conference abstract and these data have not subsequently been published in full. Methodological details were therefore incomplete, with no power calculation or details of the method of allocation.</P>
<P>Mayer's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2007</LINK>) was assumed to include the same trial participants as in the earlier publications in the abstract form of Domchowski (2002) and Appell (2003). These trials were not, therefore, combined in a meta-analysis. There was a suggestion of superiority for Coaptite&#8482; in terms of improvements in Stamey grade and quality of life at 12 months, with the latter reaching statistical significance. De novo urge incontinence was also less commonly reported in the Coaptite&#8482; group.</P>
<P>The trials comparing ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and collagen have been published in abstract form only and are not reported as showing any difference in cure rates (<LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twelve-month follow-up of 344 women showed a lower cure rate and increased loss on provocation for hyaluronic acid dextranomer combination than collagen (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 2009</LINK>). It should be noted that the collagen was administered at the bladder neck under endoscopic control while the hyaluronic acid dextranomer combination was injected blindly via a purpose-designed transurethral device at mid-urethral level.</P>
<P>A final trial compared porcine dermal implant injection (Permacol&#8482;) and silicone particles (Macroplastique&#8482;) (<LINK REF="STD-Bano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bano 2005</LINK>) in 50 patients. Whilst objective tests of improvement in symptoms showed no significant difference, subjective tests tended to favour Permacol&#8482; over Macroplastique&#8482;. When the Kings College Hospital Quality of Health questionnaire was used a significant difference was demonstrated.</P>
<P>Taken at face value, these trials suggest that silicone particles may be a more efficacious injectable than a collagen and hyaluronic acid dextranomer combination. The latter is also associated with a higher risk of local side effects that include pseudocyst and sterile abscess formation. Whilst the other trials have not demonstrated any significant differences between these agents, it should be noted that confidence intervals were wide and not all trials were adequately powered, so it remains possible that clinically relevant differences do exist. More long-term data are needed to assess relative durability of the agents (although please note that both dextranomer-hyaluronic acid (Zuidex&#8482;) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) has now been withdrawn from the market for the treatment of female stress incontinence.).</P>
<P>No relevant economic evidence were identified for the BEC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comaprison 05: one route of injection is better than another</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis was not included originally but was subsequently considered to be relevant. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schulz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schulz 2004</LINK>) compared the transurethral injection route with periurethral injection. The brief methodological details available suggest a well performed trial but no power calculation was given. The findings suggested that, with regard to subjective and objective outcomes, both periurethral and transurethral injections were equally efficacious. Periurethral injections may however be associated with more complications, particularly urinary retention. Clarifying whether these differences between transurethral injections and periurethral injections are real or due to chance requires more evidence.</P>
<P>Kuhn (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2008</LINK>) compared traditional bladder neck collagen injection with a mid-urethral injection site and reported increased patient satisfaction with the mid-urethral route (although median satisfaction levels were the same for both groups), but a higher rate of postoperative retention. Only 30 women were recruited to the trial in line with the pre-trial power calculation.</P>
<P>A further trial has subsequently been published comparing mid-urethral dextranomer-hyaluronic acid (Zuidex&#8482;) and bladder neck collagen (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 2009</LINK>). Unfortunately the trial design did not allow for any meaningful comparison of the effect of injection site location and further trials addressing this issue are awaited although they would need to use different bulking agents because, as noted earlier, dextranomer-hyaluronic acid (Zuidex&#8482;) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) have both been withdrawn from the market for the treatment of female stress incontinence.</P>
<P>No relevant economic evidence were identified for the Brief economic commentary.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-20 15:57:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-20 15:57:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite four additional trials (two trials previously reported as separate are now thought to contain duplicate results and have been amalgamated into the most up-to-date reference), this updated review still provides an unsatisfactory basis for practice.</P>
<P>Injection therapy with silicone particles shows a short-term advantage over home pelvic floor muscle training with a reduction in pad use and an increase in disease-specific quality of life; but it is not known if this is maintained beyond three months. .</P>
<P>Injection therapy appears inferior to open surgery at 12 months but has a better safety profile.</P>
<P>The treatment-related death of a patient in a single trial is sufficient evidence to recommend that autologous fat should not be used as a bulking agent. Hyaluronic acid-dextranomer combination can also not be recommended as it appears to be less efficacious with increased local side effects. Silicone particles may show a slight advantage over collagen. The difference, if any, between carbon beads, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer and porcine dermal implant has yet to be determined. Hyaluronic acid-dextranomer combination and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) have been withdrawn by the manufacturers and are no longer marketed for the treatment of female stress incontinence. Autologous myoblasts may be a promising agent for the future but further well-conducted trials are required.</P>
<P>The data are insufficient to determine whether the trans-urethral injection is superior to the periurethral route or whether mid-urethral or bladder neck injection is to be preferred.</P>
<P>For the economic evidence, we did not subject the three identified economic evaluations to critical appraisal and we did not attempt to draw any firm or general conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of collagen injection in treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI). However, the economic evidence available suggests that urethral bulking agent might be more cost-effective as an initial treatment when compared with mid-urethral slings in SUI without urethral hypermobility or as a follow-up treatment to initial surgery failure when compared with retropubic suspension or transvaginal suspension or traditional sling procedure provided injection is kept minimal. However, urethral bulking agent might be less cost-effective when compared with traditional sling as an initial treatment of SUI when the patient is followed up for a longer period (15 months) post-surgery</P>
<P>The lack of long-term follow-up and limited health economic data means that at present, injection therapy cannot be recommended as an alternative therapy for women fit for other surgical procedures. Reported outcomes are variable and at times poor and the finding of a placebo response in a single trial means that the comment concerning the usefulness of injection therapy as a first-line option is not evidence-based. For women with extensive co-morbidity precluding anaesthesia, injection therapy may represent a useful option for relief of symptoms, at least for a 12-month period. The patient and healthcare provider should know that two or three injection sessions may be required and a satisfactory result is not guaranteed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-16 15:03:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It would appear that the presently available manufactured agents are safe, but continued vigilance is required to guard against later migration of particles. With the possible exception of autologous myoblasts, it is recommended that phase III studies of newer agents will not be worthwhile until further trials have been completed using the presently available agents.</P>
<P>The durability of the available agents beyond one year remains unknown. The women included in the reviewed trials should be reassessed at two to five years to describe longer-term outcomes.</P>
<P>In addition, before injection therapy can be recommended as a standard first-line treatment for temporary or partial relief of symptomatic stress incontinence, further comparative randomised trials involving a placebo or conservative treatment arm are required as well as long-term comparative trials with specific surgical procedures. The randomised comparison of injectables with less invasive suburethral sling surgery has also already been identified as an important future trial (<LINK REF="STD-Maher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, subsequent meta-analysis would be greatly assisted by the universal adoption of standard measures of subjective and objective assessment of urinary incontinence.</P>
