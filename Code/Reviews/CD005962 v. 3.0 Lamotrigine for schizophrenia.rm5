<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-27 13:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder affecting about 1% of the general population. The symptoms of the disorder significantly affect the social, occupational and interpersonal functioning of the affected person. In spite of promising treatments for schizophrenia over the last fifty years, at least one-fifth to one-third of affected people fail to respond to treatment. In such cases, additional drugs may be administered to improve treatment response. One such drug is lamotrigine, which was introduced primarily for epilepsy ('fits'). So far there has not been any systematic analysis of those reports that have suggested the benefit of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia, hence we undertook this review.</P>
<P>We searched major medical databases for studies that have examined the use of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia. We identified five relevant studies that were conducted according to existing standards of research. A total of 537 people with schizophrenia participated in these five studies. The participants were resistant to various degrees to usual treatments and were randomised to receive either lamotrigine or placebo in addition to their usual drugs. The data regarding effectiveness could only be usefully analysed in less than 70 participants. Lamotrigine was considered to be effective if the questionnaire scores showed a greater reduction than for those who received placebo. The magnitude of this effect was small when compared to placebo.</P>
<P>Data regarding adverse effects were available from three studies. There was a higher occurrence of nausea in those receiving lamotrigine. Apart from this the common side effects were headache and dizziness.</P>
<P>The current evidence does not suggest that the addition of lamotrigine is a remarkable strategy for people with resistant schizophrenia, but the results are suggestive of a positive effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, more studies with larger number of participants are needed to confirm the true magnitude of benefit and safety. This review is limited by the poor presentation of data from the individual studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treating the 20-30% of people with schizophrenia whose symptoms are resistant to treatment can be problematic. Adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment has shown to be of benefit in preliminary studies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of adjuvant lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2006) and inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all clinical randomised trials comparing lamotrigine with placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found five relevant trials (total n=537), but no usable data on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes. Overall, reporting of data was poor. Those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26 CI 0.81 to 1.97). There was, however, a significant reduction in the PANSS total scores (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD -16.88 CI -8.57 to -25.18, p=0.0001), positive symptom sub-scale scores (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.10 CI -8.86 to -1.34) and negative symptom sub-scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.25, CI -7.07 to -3.43). Most cognitive measures showed no differences (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR not attaining BACS composite score of 0.5 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04). The proportion of participants leaving studies was about 25% at 12 weeks (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29). The lamotrigine group did experience the outcome of any adverse effects significantly more frequent than people allocated placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the many effects listed, only nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence for use of lamotrigine as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia is not robust and large well-designed, conducted and reported real-world randomised trials are needed to determine its place in everyday clinical practice.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder affecting nearly 1% of the population at any given time and one in 10000 adults (12 to 60 years of age) each year (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e4_fner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Häfner 1997</LINK>). Antipsychotics are pharmacological agents used in the management of schizophrenia since the late 1950s. The typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine and thioridazine produce troublesome clinical adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinaemia and anticholinergic problems. They are effective primarily in treating the positive symptoms of the disorder such as delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (false perceptions) and are less effective in improving the negative symptoms (lack of initiative and motivation, reduced communication) caused by the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 1997</LINK>). Newer atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine) may produce fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects, less elevations of prolactin than higher doses of the more potent older drugs, and are claimed to be effective in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia, though evidence for this is not robust (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In spite of availability of clinically effective antipsychotics, treatment response in schizophrenia is partial or incomplete in about one-fifth to one-third of treated cases (<LINK REF="REF-Conley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conley 1997</LINK>). Contributing to this treatment resistance are patient-related factors (compliance, poor social support), illness-related factors (negative symptoms) and treatment-related factors (inadequate dose, inappropriate drugs) (<LINK REF="REF-Pantelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pantelis 1996</LINK>). Current practice involves a trial of at least two antipsychotics from different chemical classes for a period of six to eight weeks with improvement rated on standardised measures (<LINK REF="REF-Frances-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frances 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herz 1997</LINK>). If the improvement is inadequate, as defined by criteria for treatment resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1988</LINK>), then a trial of clozapine is warranted. Lacunae exist in strategies other than clozapine for treatment resistance and augmentation strategies to achieve optimal therapeutic response. There is a constant search for newer drugs/strategies to optimise the pharmacological management of schizophrenia. </P>
<P>One such approach is the use of the anticonvulsant, lamotrigine. This drug was approved for use as an anticonvulsant in 1995 and soon appeared promising in the prevention of bipolar disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calabrese-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calabrese 1999</LINK>). There are preliminary reports of its efficacy in schizophrenia when added to standard antipsychotic treatments, particularly in people with schizophrenia where standard therapies had failed (<LINK REF="REF-Large-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Large 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Lamotrigine stabilises pre-synaptic neuronal membranes through blockade of voltage-dependent sodium-channels with secondary inhibition of release of excitatory neurotransmitters, especially glutamate. There is evidence that it acts as a calcium channel antagonist (<LINK REF="REF-Leach-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1986</LINK>). The commonest adverse effects of lamotrigine include rash, headache, nausea, diplopia, ataxia, dizziness and drowsiness. A maculo-papular rash occurs in 10% of patients early in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Botts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botts 1999</LINK>). Rare serious events include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (especially when used in combination with valproate), toxic epidermal necrolysis, angio-oedema, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Individual cases of leucopenia, acute renal failure and hepatotoxicity have been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 1997</LINK>). Lamotrigine is a weak folate antagonist, with theoretical teratogenic potential. Fatalities during lamotrigine treatment have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrier 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review we aim to systematically evaluate the evidence for the use of lamotrigine as an adjunct to currently existing treatments, in terms of efficacy, safety and patient acceptance.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy, safety and acceptability of lamotrigine when added to typical or atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia, compared with typical or atypical antipsychotics, placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. We would have included trials that were described as 'double-blind', but that did not mention whether the study was randomised, in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see 'Types of outcome measures') when these studies were added, we would have included them in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we utilised only clearly randomised trials and described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocated by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We selected trials that included people, irrespective of age and sex, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, any subtype, diagnosed by any criteria. While people with schizophrenia corresponding to ICD 10 Code F20* (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) and DSM IV 295* (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) were the primary focus of our review, we acknowledged that some trials may involve a more heterogenous groups of people, in particular those with schizoaffective disorder. Where possible, we would have separated data from these studies into diagnostic groups. When this was not possible, we asked the authors of the studies to provide original data. Where such separation was impossible, we would have conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of their inclusion.</P>

<P>Please note: It is only after seeing the result of one paper that we considered adding cognitive function tests as an outcome. We had omitted to do so for the original version of this protocol but think this to be an inappropriate omission. We do not think that the addition of this outcome at this late stage threatens the validity of the review.</P>
<P>* Primary outcomes<BR/>We grouped outcomes into the short term (up to 12 weeks), medium term (13 to 26 weeks) and long term (over 26 weeks).</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. Electronic searching</P>
<P>We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2006) using the phrase: </P>
<P>[(Lamotrigin* or Lamictal or Lamictin or Labileno in title, abstract or index terms of REFERENCE) or (Lamotrigin* or Lamictal or Lamictin or Labileno in interventions of STUDY)]</P>
<P>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register is based on regular searches of BIOSIS Inside, CENTRAL CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, hand searching of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources (see Group Module). No language restrictions are used. </P>
<P>2. Current Controlled Trials<BR/>We searched this database (February 2006) for ongoing trials using the terms:</P>
<P>schizophrenia AND Lamotrigin* or Lamictal or Lamictin or Labileno</P>
<P>3. Reference checking<BR/>We searched citations of all identified trials for additional trials. We also searched the references cited in narrative reviews and guidelines on schizophrenia. We also sought all selected studies as a citation on ISI database in order to identify more studies.</P>
<P>4. Personal communication<BR/>We contacted the first author of each trial for additional references and for unpublished trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies marketing lamotrigine for relevant published and unpublished data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We (TSP, JAP) independently inspected the citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant abstracts and ordered full papers and reassessed these for inclusion and methodological quality. We discussed and reported any disagreement that took place during this process.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We independently allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, we included trials if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B. </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?<BR/>When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated to, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible, and further information was necessary, we did not enter data into the analyses and allocated the study to the list of those awaiting assessment. We only included trials in Category A or B in the review. We used The Jadad Scale to complement quality assessments but not to exclude trials.</P>
<P>3. Data management</P>
<P>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data from each selected report and attempted to resolve any disagreement by discussion. Where disagreement persisted, or if published results made data extraction difficult, we attempted to obtain clarification from the authors of the trial, pending which we assigned the trial to those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3.2 Binary outcomes<BR/>We excluded binary data if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up. Where binary outcomes (proportions) were used, we calculated relative risks (RR), fixed and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. In addition, where appropriate, we attempted to calculate absolute measures, the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) with their 95% confidence intervals. We undertook analyses on an intention to treat basis. </P>
<P>3.3 Continuous outcomes<BR/>We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up. We reported continuous data as presented in the original studies, without making any assumptions about those lost to follow up. We calculated pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) along with confidence intervals, for outcomes using similar scales. </P>
<P>3.3.1 Validity of continuous measures<BR/>We only included continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report, or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). Unpublished instruments are more likely to report statistically significant findings than those that have been peer reviewed and published (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>3.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>People dropped out of each of the studies of their own volition or as a result of a decision made by the trialists. For binary outcomes, we assigned people who left of their own accord to the least favourable outcome group. We tested the effects of this assignment in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>3.5 Normal distribution of continuous data<BR/>Data on continuous outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, all data included in the review met the following criteria: <BR/>i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; <BR/>ii. when a scale started from 0 the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). <BR/>iii. if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS that can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in ii) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness was considered present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. </P>
<P>Data that did not meet these standards were not entered into the RevMan software (which assumes a normal distribution). However, we reported data not meeting these criteria in additional tables and in the text, if they had been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests.</P>
<P>3.6 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data are available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former. </P>
<P>3.7 Presentation of data<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the intervention of interest. For some scales a high score indicates a bad outcome, but for others, high scores are good. When the latter was the case the area to the left of the line indicates a favourable outcome for the control group and is so labelled.</P>
<P>4. Heterogeneity <BR/>After considering the likelihood of clinical heterogeneity based on comparisons of the included studies, we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We calculated the value of I-squared to provide an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. We interpreted an I-squared value of 50% or greater as indicating high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented it separately and investigated the reasons for heterogeneity. In any event, if substantial heterogeneity was present, we undertook a sensitivity analysis to the presence or absence of these data.</P>
<P>5. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>6. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis<BR/>We undertook sensitivity analyses in all instances when heterogeneity was detected. The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis. In addition, we detected the differences in outcomes for people with schizophrenia as opposed to those with schizo-affective disorder in a subgroup analysis. </P>
<P>7. Publication bias<BR/>When outcomes include data from five or more trials, we entered data into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of the studies please see Included and Excluded Studies tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded nine studies from the review. Two were non-randomised open trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heck-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heck 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 2004</LINK>). We excluded one study because participants were healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK>) and two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calabrese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calabrese 2000</LINK>) as the illness being addressed was rapid cycling bipolar disorder. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Sikich-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sikich 2004</LINK> because, although randomised, and dealing with people with schizophrenia, they evaluated interventions other than lamotrigine. Finally, we had to exclude <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2002</LINK> from the review as it was only a proposal for use of lamotrigine in schizophrenia and the actual study was not conducted. </P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>Two studies currently await assessment. Both reports (<LINK REF="STD-Adityanjee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adityanjee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bustillo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bustillo 2001</LINK>) are proposals to the Stanley Foundation Research Awards. From the titles, they are suggestive of randomised trials with lamotrigine for schizophrenia but contain no further data. It is impossible to ascertain from the proposals if these studies were conducted. We have contacted the authors for further information. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We did not identify any ongoing studies. </P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We included five studies. All were described as randomised and double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>). Two of these were multi-centre (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>), and one was a cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is an illness that often affects young people and may be life-long. Four studies reported data on short-term follow-up (up to 12 weeks) but one had medium-term duration (13 to 26 weeks).</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>Three of the five included studies involved participants with schizophrenia diagnosed using operationalised criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>) included people with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. The majority of participants in most studies were men, aged in their early thirties to mid forties. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>) required people to be treatment resistant to past drug trials. The other three studies required persisting positive symptoms without mention of resistance to treatment. Most people in the studies were moderately to severely ill. </P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were defined in all studies and they excluded co-morbid medical or psychiatric conditions, co-administration of other treatment modalities and allergy to the interventional drugs. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>) examined stability of symptoms from screening to baseline and excluded those with a change &gt;20%.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Three of the five studies were described as occurring in a hospital or inpatient settings (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>). We could find no explicit information on the settings of the remaining studies. </P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> were by far the largest studies, both with just over 200 people. All remaining studies included between 30 and 40 participants.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>Lamotrigine was given as an adjuvant only to antipsychotic agents in all the trials and there were no reports of lamotrigine mono-therapy for schizophrenia. Trialists gave lamotrigine in a wide range of doses from 125 mg per day to 400 mg per day. The only trial to use lamotrigine in a dose greater than 200 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>) used 400 mg/day only for the last two weeks of the 10-week trial. All studies administered either single or variable choice of antipsychotics. Flexible blind dosing was explicitly mentioned in <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> had a fixed dosing schedule. Lamotrigine was added to risperidone (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>), clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>) or atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>). Some participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> were on typical antipsychotics. Comparators were placebo in all trials. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>, required an antipsychotic free period prior to the study. All drugs were given orally.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state: <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported data on Global state using the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> used the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) also as a measure of global functioning. </P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Cognitive state: <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> compared adjuvant lamotrigine with adjuvant placebo and reported usable data on cognitive state having used mean change in Stroop Colour Naming Tests as its chosen measure. No other study reported usable data on this outcome. Both <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> report skewed data on cognitive state reported as Least Square Mean change in the Brief Assessment of Cognition for Schizophrenia (BACS) scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Mental state: Of all the studies only <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> reports usable mental state data but these data were only from people who had completed the trial and not everyone originally randomised (not an intention to treat analysis). A mental state response was derived from comparing mean decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) between the study groups and also by proportions improved at the end of trial. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> also had usable mental state data obtained by other scales like Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21). Usable data on positive sub-scale of the PANSS could be extracted from <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>. We could not use other data on mental state from <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>, as outcome data were the combined results of a cross-over trial. The mean and standard error of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> were presented in the form of a two dimensional figure. The figure was enlarged up to 200% and data were derived by marking the co-ordinates on the x and y axes. The standard deviation was calculated using the standard error illustrated in the graph. Data for PANSS total scores, negative symptoms and general psychopathology sub-scales were thus calculated but we were unable to extract reliable data for the positive symptoms sub-scale scores. In <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, there was data about PANSS, SANS, WHO Well Being Index (WHO-5), and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) scores but they were skewed. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> provide usable data on proportions that responded to treatment defined as a 20% or great improvement in the PANSS total scores. </P>
<P>4.6.1.4 Adverse effects: Three studies report usable data on adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>). Both studies by Goff report data on adverse effects, non-fatal serious adverse effects and fatal serious adverse effects. There were no usable adverse effect data in <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>, or <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>. </P>
<P>4.6.1.5 Leaving study early: All included studies provide usable data on leaving the study early. </P>
<P>4.6.2 Outcome scales: details of the only scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section.</P>
<P>4.6.2.1 Global state - Clinical Global Impressions - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is a rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery. There are two forms of this measure; CGI-S rates people according to severity of symptoms, while CGI-I reports improvement from baseline. </P>
<P>4.6.2.2 Short Form Health Survey - SF-36 (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1992</LINK>)<BR/>The SF-36 was not specifically developed for psychiatric patients but was defined as a generic instrument for medical outcome measurement. It consists of 36 items grouped into the following eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. These eight scales can be summed up into two broader dimensions: physical health and mental health. It is a self rated instrument, which can be completed in approximately 15 minutes. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher quality of life. </P>
<P>4.6.2.3 Mental state - Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> reported data for this scale. <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> reported data for the positive sub-scale of this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.4 Mental state - Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>).<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0 to 126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.5 Mental state - Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia; affective blunting; avolition-apathy; anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.6 Mental state - 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HAM-D21 (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) <BR/>This instrument is designed to be used on patients diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale has a 17-item and 21-item versions. High scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.7 Mental state - Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia - CDSS (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1990</LINK>)<BR/>The CDSS is an observer scale, based on semi-structured, goal-directed interviews, specifically developed for the assessment of the level of depression in schizophrenia. The presence or absence of clinically significant depression was determined using a cut-off point of six. The scale is designed to reflect the presence of depression exclusive of other dimensions of psychopathology in schizophrenia, such as negative and extrapyramidal symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.8 The World Health Organisation 5-item Well-Being Index - WHO-5 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>)<BR/>The WHO-5 is a short screening instrument for the detection of depression in the general population. The design of the questionnaire is based on Zung's self-rating scales for depression, anxiety and psychological distress. The initial version of this scale had 28 items, which was scaled down to 10 items and then to five items in subsequent revisions. <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported outcomes on this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.9 Cognitive state - Brief Assessment of Cognition for Schizophrenia - BACS (<LINK REF="REF-Keefe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 2004</LINK>)<BR/>The BACS takes approximately 30 minutes to administer, and is devised for easy administration and scoring by non-psychologists. It is specifically designed to measure treatment-related improvements, and includes two alternate forms. The BACS is reliable, has equivalent forms, and is as sensitive to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia as standard two and a half hour batteries. The battery of tests in the BACS includes brief assessments of reasoning and problem solving, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed. <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.10 Cognitive state - Stroop color and word test (<LINK REF="REF-Golden-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golden 1978</LINK>)<BR/>It has been shown that individuals with schizophrenia do not perform as well as controls on this test of selective attention. The test consists of two cards containing 100 items. Subjects are required to read one card of black printed words and then name the colours of color words printed in non-matching colours on a second card. The Stroop Effect dictates that the word red printed in green ink presents conflicting information which slows cognitive processing. The time to complete each card and the number of errors made on each card is recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2.11 Adverse effects - Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>) <BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items) and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>4.6.3 Redundant data<BR/>Enormous efforts were invested in studies rating and recording data that are then reported in such a way as to render them useless for reviews such as this. For example, in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>) outcomes such as death, clearly of interest, were not reported explicitly. We can only assume sure that no person died. A number of physiological tests are reported to have been done in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>) but no usable explicit data is available. </P>
<P>4.6.4 Missing outcomes<BR/>No usable outcomes were found for the following categories: service outcomes, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment and economic outcomes. </P>
<P>4.6.5 Primary outcomes<BR/>Our primary dichotomous outcome of clinical response was usable in <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were said to be randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> stated that randomisation was carried out using lists and that those in charge of allocation were blind to the participant list. This concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). Hence one of the reviewers (TSP) felt that these studies were placed under category A (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results). But in the co-reviewers opinion, the description of the randomisation process should have been even more explicit and hence were placed under category B (moderate risk of bias - some doubt about the results - see Methods). The other three trials were also category B as there was no explicit statement on allocation concealment in spite of being randomised and double blind. </P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>All included studies were described as being double-blind. In <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> the randomised double-blind treatment phase with adjuvant lamotrigine was preceded by a non-random run in. A possibility of such a run in was possibly present in both <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, but not explicitly mentioned. Not one of the studies reported testing of the blinding. If blinding is recognised to be of such importance for minimising observation bias, it could be expected that testing of this blinding would be a priority.</P>
<P>3. Loss to follow up<BR/>Three of the included studies reported data in terms of a last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>). It is unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, what is referred to as the intention to treat (ITT) population as the numbers differ from numbers randomised. Outcome assessments in both the studies pertain to the ITT population. An OC analysis (observed cases, defined as those completing the trial) was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>. Although LOCF analyses are commonly used to account for missing observations, this technique could introduce bias as considerable assumptions are made about people who did not stay in the study. We saw no reporting of attempts to validate assumptions by following up people who did drop out early. </P>
<P>The reasons for loss to follow up are reasonably well reported. </P>
<P>4. Data reporting <BR/>Overall much of the data we found could not be used because of poor reporting. Findings which are presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as p-values are often of little use to a reviewer. We are seeking further data from the first authors of relevant trials.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>The initial search resulted in 20 citations. We were able to locate two more studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>) from the American Psychiatric Association 2006 abstracts. These two studies were funded by Glaxo SmithKline and we found the raw data from the Current Controlled Trials web site. We were able to include only five of the 22 studies in the review. These five trials included reports as some studies are reported several times in different media.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON: ADJUVANT LAMOTRIGINE versus ADJUVANT PLACEBO</P>
<P>2.1 Global state <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported dichotomous data on improvement in global state as defined as CGI responders who had a score of one (very much improved) or two (much improved). There was no difference in proportions of people achieving responder status (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). The global CGI severity scores were presented as change scores (continuous data) in <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, but they were skewed and are presented separately. <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> also provides data on global functioning using the SF-36, but the results are presented separately due to skewness.</P>
<P>2.2 Mental state<BR/>2.2.1 Total scores <BR/>Improvement in psychotic symptoms was the primary outcome for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> reported dichotomous data on PANSS responders defined as people with a greater than 20% reduction in total score from baseline. There was no significant differences between adjuvant lamotrigine or adjuvant placebo in the proportions improved (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26, CI 0.81 to 1.97). Limited data from <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> indicate that people given adjuvant lamotrigine had significantly lower total end-point PANSS scores compared with those in the placebo group (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD -16.88 CI -8.57 to -25.18, p=0.0001). The PANSS mean change scores from <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> were skewed and are therefore reported separately. The total score on BPRS failed to show superiority of adjuvant lamotrigine over placebo (n=31, 1 RCT, WMD -2.80 CI -12.44 to 6.84).</P>
<P>There is a suggestion of a linear relationship between the dose of lamotrigine used in the trials and the direction and strength of the effect for the PANSS total scores; the trial that used doses of lamotrigine of 400 mg/ day (<LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>) more strongly favoured lamotrigine over placebo compared to those that used doses of 200 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>) or lower (<LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>). To increase power to test this assumption, we calculated mean difference in change data for PANSS total scores along with their standard errors from all trials (except <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>) in order the overcome the problem of skewed data in <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>. We compared the differences in mean changes in the two intervention arms using generic inverse variance. The results did confirm the suggestion of a dose-response relationship with non-overlapping confidence intervals in the subgroups, but the data were heterogenous and are hence not included in the main analysis. They are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. However, ratings on the PANSS derived BPRS from <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> did not show any significant difference in total scores on adding lamotrigine to ongoing treatment. </P>
<P>2.2.2 Positive symptoms<BR/>Improvement as defined by mean difference in positive sub-scale scores of the PANSS were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>. There was a significant reduction in end-point positive sub-scale scores for people given adjuvant lamotrigine as compared with those given placebo (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.10 CI -8.86 to -1.34). Average change scores in positive sub-scale of PANSS have been reported by <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, but are skewed and hence are reported separately.</P>
<P>2.2.3 Negative symptoms<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> reported reduction in endpoint scores when rated by the negative symptom sub-scale of the PANSS in participants receiving adjuvant lamotrigine versus placebo. We derived normally distributed data from <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> for this outcome by the method described earlier. There was a significant reduction in the PANSS negative symptom sub-scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.25 CI -7.07 to -3.43). Using the SANS scale, however, <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> did not find a significant reduction in negative symptoms between participants on adjuvant lamotrigine or placebo (n=31, 1 RCT, WMD -8.80 CI -19.73 to 2.13). The average change scores in SANS (<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>) were skewed and are hence presented separately.</P>
<P>2.2.4 General psychopathology<BR/>There was a significant reduction in PANSS general psychopathology sub-scale endpoint scores for participants on adjuvant lamotrigine in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK> (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD -10.74 CI -16.53 to 4.96). The endpoint data obtained from change scores from <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> were skewed and are presented separately.</P>
<P>2.2.5 Mood symptoms<BR/>Adjuvant lamotrigine did not show any superiority over placebo in the improvement of mood symptoms as measured by end-point scores on the HAM-D 21 (n=31, 1 RCT, WMD -0.10 CI -3.69 to 3.89). Average change scores on the CDSS were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, and on the WHO-5 by <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK>, but were skewed.</P>
<P>2.3 Cognitive state<BR/>Dichotomous data: <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> reported proportion of participants improving in cognitive function, as defined by a change in BACS composite score of equal or greater than 0.5. There was no significant difference between adjuvant lamotrigine and adjuvant placebo in this analysis (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04).</P>
<P>Continuous data: One study, <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>, provided usable data on cognitive function using the Stroop test. There were significant differences between adjuvant lamotrigine and placebo in the colour naming time (n=36, 1 RCT, -29.45 CI -53.69 to -5.21)and colour naming error (n=36, 1 RCT, WMD -8.28 CI -12.85 to -3.71), but not in the word reading time (n=36, 1 RCT, WMD -0.61 CI -10.81 to 12.03) or word reading error (n=36, 1 RCT, WMD -0.33 CI -2.46 to 1.80).</P>
<P>2.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>About 24% of the participants enrolled in all included studies were withdrawn or lost to follow up. The attrition rate was less than 30% in all individual studies. The proportion of participants leaving the study early was not significant in the lamotrigine group (24%) when compared with placebo (25.4%) (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29).</P>
<P>2.5 Adverse effects<BR/>2.5.1 Death, self harm, ideation about harm to self or others - short term<BR/>There were no deaths reported with adjuvant lamotrigine or placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> differentiated between non-fatal serious adverse effects and adverse effects. The list of non-fatal adverse effects included events such as schizophrenia, paranoia and psychotic disorder, which we felt were part of the mental state and not an adverse effect. Hence our list of clinically significant non-fatal serious adverse effects does differ from that of the trials and some data are presented outside of the adverse effect category.</P>
<P>2.5.2 Any one or more fatalistic acts/ impulses - short term<BR/>The adjuvant lamotrigine group did not have a significantly higher occurrence of non-fatal serious adverse effects, compared with placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 0.90 to 6.30).</P>
<P>2.5.3 Specific fatalistic acts/impulses - short term<BR/>There were no significant differences between the selected specific non-fatal serious advice effects: suicide attempt (n=217, 1 RCT, RR 2.97 CI 0.12 to 72.18), homicidal ideation (n=217, 1 RCT, RR 4.95 CI 0.24 to 102.01) and suicidal ideation (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR1.05 CI 0.15 to 7.06).</P>
<P>2.5.4 Adverse effects - short term<BR/>The list of adverse events extracted from <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goff-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Goff 2006b</LINK> were exhaustive, ranging from arthropod bite to skin rash. The latter two studies reported every event which happened during the trial period. We considered some of these events, such as endometrial cancer, tooth abscess, and joint injury, to be unrelated to the intervention and hence presented them separately as events co-incident with the trial. There were no significant differences between the comparator groups with respect to these co-incident events. We grouped other adverse effects by system. </P>
<P>The occurrence of any adverse effects was significantly more frequent in the adjuvant lamotrigine group (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the effects listed, nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88). No other adverse effects reported showed significant differences between the groups. Some of the commonly reported, adverse effects with adjuvant lamotrigine were headache (14.6%), vomiting (6.3%), somnolence (5.1%), dizziness (5.1%), tremor (4.6%), diarrhoea (3.9%) and insomnia (3.7%). The incidence of rash was more in the placebo arm (3.0%) compared with adjuvant lamotrigine (2.1%). There was an increase of blood glucose in people receiving adjuvant lamotrigine (2.8% versus 1.9% for placebo). Other metabolic indices such as alanine aminotransferase increase and aspartate aminotransferase increase were infrequent. Weight gain was noted in 0.9% of the people allocated lamotrigine.</P>
<P>We could not comment on the extra pyramidal side effects as given by scores on ESRS or dose of anticholinergic agent requirement, as both the data were skewed. In general the mean ESRS score and anticholinergic requirement was lower for the lamotrigine group when compared to placebo. We were unable to do a sensitivity analysis for various subtypes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, as the numbers were not reported separately.</P>
<P>3. Publication bias<BR/>There were too few trials to look for funnel plot asymmetry.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of findings<BR/>Four of the five included studies occurred in high income countries and one study took place in a low income country (Iran). From the descriptions of the studies, it is likely that the majority took place in similar hospital environments. Clinicians should take this into consideration when thinking of using lamotrigine in very different settings of care. The addition of lamotrigine may be a costly option in low income countries, and unless the results conclusively indicate benefit, this option may add too much to the financial burden of treating chronic mental illness.</P>
<P>The majority of trials involved participants with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity. Such people are not seen so often in everyday care. Often patients are not in hospital, suffer from less well defined illness, and have combined problems such as depression, physical illnesses and substance misuse. The various doses of drugs used in the trials in this review further limit applicability. On the other hand at least two of the studies have selected treatment resistant individuals and the others required some degree of psychopathology in spite of ongoing antipsychotic therapy. Many of the participants were on clozapine. Thus the findings may be applicable to clinicians who deal with chronic patients at a tertiary care level, where other treatment options have failed. We feel, that although applicability is problematic, the findings of such studies are likely to be different by degree rather than by direction.</P>
<P>2. Limited data, confusing data<BR/>The collection and quality of the data reported was very variable. </P>
<P>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>, which lasted 14 weeks, no studies reported outcomes over 12 weeks. Lamotrigine is a relatively new compound for this indication, so it is not surprising that long term studies are rare at this point, but it is to be hoped that they are planned. Even if an intervention works in the short term (by 12 weeks) there is no guarantee that this means that the compound has long term benefits. Often the trialists do not have an obligation to follow people up for longer than the period during which they took the medication. One possible consequence of this might be that an extreme adverse reaction to discontinuation of an intervention, such as death, would go unreported if it occurred a week after the treatment stopped. Data beyond the discontinuation of the medications used within the trial are collected but not reported. This data should be reported since it is not the individual compounds in a trial which are randomised but the intention to give those individual compounds.</P>
<P>Data were often not used because of high drop-out rates. But the drop out rate in our included studies is low, probably due to the conduct of the some studies, for example, <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK>, in closed environments. </P>
<P>Trialists tended to report results in the form of figures without accompanying actual numerical values. The crossover study by <LINK REF="STD-Tiihonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiihonen 2003</LINK> combines the results of both the cross over periods without mention of end-of-first-phase scores. Such data are problematic for meta-analysis. The clinical condition under investigation is not stable and carryover effects cannot be ruled out so we feel that inclusion of these post-crossover data would not be prudent.</P>
<P>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, minimal outcome data were available on death, and no outcome data available on service outcomes (in hospital, time in outpatient clinic), general functioning (including healthy days), behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, and economic outcomes. The primary outcome of this review was improvement in mental state and, at the time of writing, data were only available from three studies. Other outcomes were of secondary importance to us, but we have reported what we can in order to present the most complete data set possible for the reader. </P>
<P>Two trials did report a comprehensive list of adverse effects but, on the other hand, there was one trial which just mentioned that there were no significant differences in side effects between the groups. Lamotrigine is a drug with potentially life threatening rare adverse effects (Steven-Johnsons syndrome). The reporting of even minor adverse effects is of prime importance.</P>
<P>Finally, we obtained some data from conference proceedings and posters and reliable data extraction was difficult as results were often summarised. Several studies were multiply reported. Without unique study identifiers this can gives the impression that there are more data than actually exist and facilitates erroneous double counting.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 1: ADJUVANT LAMOTRIGINE versus ADJUVANT PLACEBO</P>
<P>1. Global state<BR/>Adjuvant lamotrigine has not shown superiority in effect over placebo in improving the global condition of the participants. This point is important considering the nature of schizophrenia, a disorder having an impact on the individual as a whole. Thus improvement in domains of the disease assessed by scale derived continuous data without a clinically meaningful overall global change is unlikely to make a marked positive difference in the affected individual. No data were available regarding participant's views, or those of their carers/ family, regarding their satisfaction with interventions, to evaluate this relationship further. </P>
<P>2. Mental state<BR/>2.1 Total scores<BR/>Data for the proportions of people who reduced PANSS total scores by 20% or greater did not significantly favour adjuvant lamotrigine over adjuvant placebo. Reported correlations between change in PANSS total scores and improvement on the CGI from other data sources suggest that ratings of minimally improved (CGI-I=3) at weeks one, two, four and six corresponded to a percentage PANSS reduction of 19%, 23%, 26% and 28%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>). If extrapolated to the results of this review, this could suggest that the proportions of those who attained even minimal global improvement did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Limited data from two trials on the differences in mean end-point total PANSS scores did favour adding lamotrigine to existing antipsychotic drug treatment. The clinical significance of a 17 point difference in means for PANSS total scores between adjunctive lamotrigine and adjunctive placebo may also be important in this group of people with limited treatment options. Such an interpretation, however, has to also consider that the study reporting this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK>) did not use intent to treat analysis and that only approximate values could be derived from <LINK REF="STD-Akhondzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akhondzadeh 2005</LINK>. </P>
<P>Few of the trials used doses that would be considered adequate and even <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2004</LINK> maintained participants on 400 mg/day of lamotrigine only for the last two weeks of the eight-week trial. At this juncture the observations from the post-hoc subgroup analysis regarding a differential response to doses above 200 mg/day are intriguing but can only be considered hypothesis generating. The issue of optimal dosing is important from the perspectives of improved efficacy and safety as well as additional costs.</P>
<P>1.2 Negative/positive sub-scores <BR/>The positive, negative and general psychopathology sub-scale-scores as measured with the PANSS showed significant difference favouring adjuvant lamotrigine but, again, the small mean decrease in scores may not be really clinically relevant. The data from the specific measure of negative symptoms (SANS) were equivocal and casts doubt on the advantage of adjuvant lamotrigine over placebo for these difficult problems. </P>
<P>1.3 Mood symptom scores<BR/>Limited data (n=31) suggest no significant benefit from adjuvant lamotrigine with respect to depressive symptoms in schizophrenia. This may be a relevant negative point for lamotrigine considering the high co-morbidity of depression and schizophrenia.</P>
<P>2. Cognitive state<BR/>Analyses reveal positive effects of adjuvant lamotrigine on some sub tests of the Stroop test but adjuvant lamotrigine did not show promising results in the BACS ratings. It could be that the Stoop test findings are the results of random error. The study using this test was small (n=36) and no results positive or equivocal are based on any authoritative numbers with adequate power. </P>
<P>3. Adverse effects<BR/>The data available for adverse effects is more than that for the efficacy parameters. People allocated to adjunctive lamotrigine were more at risk of any adverse effect compared with those given placebo as an adjunct. It is difficult to see where this finding comes from because, when adverse effects are broken down by system, it is not obvious where the difference lies. However, people allocated to lamotrigine do experience more feeling that they had some adverse effects and this must be seen as a disadvantage of the experimental compound. </P>
<P>With the exception of nausea there were no significant differences in the incidence of specific adverse effects, fatalistic acts/impulses/ideas or fatal events caused by addition of lamotrigine to ongoing therapy. Also, any adverse effects could have been due to the primary antipsychotics used, which were different in the studies. Lamotrigine does not seem to worsen the known complications of antipsychotic use such as weight gain, increase in liver enzymes and blood sugars. No conclusion could be drawn about lamotrigine's influence on extra pyramidal symptoms (EPSP), as data on both the rating scale scores for EPS and the need for anticholinergic drugs, are skewed. However the data suggests lesser incidence of EPS with lamotrigine, given the lower mean ESRS scores and lower mean requirement for anticholinergic drugs in this group.</P>
<P>4. Leaving study early<BR/>About 25% of people left the studies early by 12 weeks. There was no difference between groups. This lower then average attrition could be due to the closed settings in which these trials took place and may not reflect routine practice where non-compliance is common. Whatever the adverse effects were that were more common in the lamotrigine group they did not seem to aggravate poor compliance with medication.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>With the current available evidence about adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment, it appears that there may be a marginal positive effect on some psychotic symptoms. This evidence, however, is drawn from a small sample of few studies and we cannot be confident that it would still be evident in larger more robust studies. However, for chronically ill people, for whom other treatments have failed, the strategy of adding lamotrigine may be useful, for even a marginal improvement could make a marked difference. If discernable benefit was not forthcoming within a few months, there is almost no evidence to suggest continuing treatment beyond this time period.</P>
<P>For most people, addition of lamotrigine will mean extra costs for medicines and may affect compliance to medicines. Those using lamotrigine as an additional treatment are likely to experience more adverse effects particularly nausea, headache, vomiting and dizziness. Such incidence can endanger compliance to other more useful drugs, so it would seem important that people with schizophrenia do not see the primary antipsychotic as causing the lamotrigine-induced problems, where these occur. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Lamotrigine is one of the novel adjuvant strategies a clinician in tertiary care setting can try. Clinicians may be under pressure to act because the person with schizophrenia has been unresponsive to usual care. The results suggest that there is far too little evidence to incorporate lamotrigine as routine care for people whose illness is resistant to treatment. Of course, individual patients may be experimentally allocated to lamotrigine outside of a controlled trial setting and could derive some benefit. There are, however, ethical arguments against such uncontrolled experimentation. Currently, prescribing adjuvant lamotrigine for schizophrenia outside of a randomised trial may be considered unsupportable.</P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>Adjuvant lamotrigine is yet another new treatment strategy that may have limited effects on some people with serious mental illnesses. There is currently insufficient evidence to support inclusion of lamotrigine in prescribing policy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>As with similar studies, public registration of a study before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers to identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and many outcomes. Failure to comply with such standard guidelines results in both loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or managers. </P>
<P>An intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least, be presented as numbers. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, 'p' values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value. Unfortunately, in spite of the large numbers of participants randomised, we were unable to use most of the data in the trials included in this review due to poor reporting.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>As an anticonvulsant agent with a glutamate based mechanism of action, lamotrigine remains an interesting compound. But pragmatic, real world, randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its value in standard clinical practice. Such studies should have fewer exclusion criteria, should not deviate much from usual clinical practice, should evaluate doses between 200 mg to 400 mg, and examine clinically meaningful outcomes such as medium and long-term risks (including mortality), behaviour, satisfaction with treatment and cost-effectiveness (suggested future trial is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
