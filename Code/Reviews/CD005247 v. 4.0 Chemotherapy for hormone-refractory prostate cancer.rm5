<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Men with advanced prostate cancer and painful bone metastases are a difficult group of patients to treat. Data from recent randomised trials of chemotherapy suggest an improvement in overall survival, pain relief, and quality of life with this form of therapy. Side effects are common and can be severe. Chemotherapy offers a treatment option for men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), but the decision to treat should be carefully considered by the patient and clinician. More studies are needed to find new and better agents. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Prostate cancer mainly affects elderly men, and its incidence has steadily increased over the last decade. The management of this disease is replete with controversy. In men with advanced, metastatic prostate cancer, hormone therapy is almost universally accepted as the initial treatment of choice and produces good responses in most patients. However, many patients will relapse and become resistant to further hormone manipulation; the outlook for these patients is poor. Many have disease extending to the skeleton, which is associated with severe pain. Therapies for these men include chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, palliative radiotherapy, and radioisotopes. Systemic chemotherapy has been evaluated in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) for many years, with disappointing results. However, more recent studies with newer agents have shown encouraging results. There is therefore a need to explore the value of chemotherapy in this disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The present review aims to assess the role of chemotherapy in men with metastatic HRPC. The major outcome was overall survival. Secondary objectives include the effect of chemotherapy on pain relief, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, quality of life, and treatment-related toxicity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Trials were identified by searching electronic databases, such as MEDLINE, and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. There was no restriction of language or location.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only published randomised trials of chemotherapy in HRPC patients were eligible for inclusion in this review. Randomised comparisons of different chemotherapeutic regimens, chemotherapy versus best standard of care or placebo, were relevant to this review. Randomised, dose-escalation studies were not included in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction tables were designed specifically for this review to aid data collection. Data from relevant studies were extracted and included information on trial design, participants, and outcomes. Trial quality was also assessed using a scoring system for randomisation, blinding, and description of patient withdrawal.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Out of 107 randomised trials of chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer identified by the search strategy, 47 were included in this review and represented 6929 patients with HRPC. <BR/>Only two trials compared the same chemotherapeutic interventions and therefore a meta-analysis was considered inappropriate. The quality of some trials was poor because of poor reporting, low-patient recruitment, or poor trial design. For clarity, trials were categorised according to the major drug used, but this was not a definitive grouping, since many trials used several agents and would be eligible for inclusion in a number of categories. Drug categories included estramustine, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and docetaxel. Only studies using docetaxel reported a significant improvement in overall survival compared to best standard of care, although the increase was small (&lt; 2.5 months). The mean percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in PSA compared to baseline was as follows: estramustine 48%; 5-fluorouracil 20%; doxorubicin 50% (one study only); mitoxantrone 33%; and docetaxel 52%. Pain relief was reported in 35% to 76% of patients receiving either single agents or combination regimens. A three weekly regime of docetaxel significantly improved pain relief compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone (the latter regimen approved as standard therapy for HRPC in the USA). All chemotherapeutics, either as single agents or in combination, were associated with toxicity; the major ones being myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, cardiac toxicity, neuropathy, and alopecia. Quality of life was significantly improved with docetaxel compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Patients with HRPC have not traditionally been offered chemotherapy as a routine treatment because of treatment-related toxicity and poor responses. Recent data from randomised studies, in particular those using docetaxel, have provided encouraging improvements in overall survival, palliation of symptoms, and improvements in quality of life. Chemotherapy should be considered as a treatment option for patients with HRPC. However, patients should make an informed decision based on the risks and benefits of chemotherapy.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:07:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in Europe and the United States of America. The incidence of prostate cancer for men under the age of 40 years is 1 in 10,000 compared with a 1 in 7 for those aged over 60 (<LINK REF="REF-Woolam-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolam 2000</LINK>). Prostate cancer is a major clinical problem, not only because of its high incidence and mortality, but also because of the severe morbidity associated with the advanced stages of this disease. Treatment for clinically localised disease consists of early intervention with surgery, radiation therapy, androgen suppression, or observation. Long-term clinical outcomes are generally quite good for all these treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Catalona-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalona 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelefsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelefsky 2003</LINK>); although it is not clear if one approach provides a superior increase in survival or quality of life. However, in as many as 10% to 50% of men with prostate cancer the disease will progress (<LINK REF="REF-Goktas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goktas 1999</LINK>) and spread to the pelvic lymph nodes and bone. The major complication associated with bone metastases is severe pain, and for these patients treatment is primarily palliative.</P>
<P>The growth of prostate cancer is highly dependent on circulating androgens, in particular testosterone. The standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is hormone ablation therapy either by surgical castration (orchidectomy) or medical castration with lutenising hormone-releasing antagonists (LHRH) with or without anti-androgens. Androgen ablation therapy induces palliation of symptoms in many patients; however, over time the majority become refractory to hormone therapy with less than 50% alive at 5 years. </P>
<P>Chemotherapy for HRPC has had a modest impact on the treatment of this disease. In one study, the combination of mitoxantrone with prednisone was reported to induce a palliative response in 29% of patients with symptomatic disease compared to 12% receiving prednisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>). Quality of life was also improved with the combination arm. In another trial, mitoxantrone combined with hydrocortisone was shown to induce a delay in disease progression and an improved quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>); however, in both trials there was no improvement in overall survival with chemotherapy. </P>
<P>In two phase II trials in patients with hormone refractory cancer, combining estramustine with other microtubule inhibitors induced favourable responses. Estramustine plus vinblastine was assessed in 36 patients and a greater than 50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was observed in 61% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hudes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudes 1992</LINK>). Similarly, when estramustine plus etoposide was administered to 42 patients, pre-treatment PSA levels fell by at least 75% in 28% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Pienta-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pienta 1994</LINK>). Paclitaxel has also shown synergy with estramustine when given as a 96-hour infusion with a 68% PSA response in patients with bone-only disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hudes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudes 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Triple drug combinations have also been evaluated in patients with HRPC. The toxicity, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were evaluated in combination with oral estramustine and dexamethasone in a phase I study in patients with metastatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Petrylak--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrylak 1999</LINK>). In minimally pre-treated patients, 6 out of 24 experienced grade 3/4 granulocytopenia. A greater than 50% decrease in PSA was seen in 70% and 50% of minimally pre-treated and extensively pre-treated patients, respectively. The combination of oral estramustine, oral etoposide and intravenous paclitaxel was also reported to be active in patients with advanced prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>). This regime was tolerable and did not impact on quality of life.</P>
<P>During the 1980s, metastatic prostate cancer was reported to be unresponsive to chemotherapy with a response rate of less than 9% (<LINK REF="REF-Yagoda-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yagoda 1993</LINK>). However, much progress has been made since then and the results from randomised clinical studies has led to the approval of mitoxantrone combined with corticosteroids for the palliative treatment of HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>). The encouraging results of recent clinical trials suggest a need to systematically evaluate the role of chemotherapy in this disease. The present review will assess the published evidence on chemotherapy for advanced prostate cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment and, if possible, summarise the data by meta-analysis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapy in the management of hormone refractory prostate cancer; to undertake subgroup analysis; and where data are available, to establish the efficacy of different chemotherapeutic regimes.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All phase II and phase III randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials comparing chemotherapy with placebo or one chemotherapeutic regime with another regime were eligible for assessment for this review. There were no language restrictions and studies initiated in any country will be considered providing they comply with other inclusion criteria. Only studies that report some or all of the outcome measures will be included for review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with advanced prostate cancer refractory to hormone therapy (HRPC). The definition of hormone refractory may vary between trials, but in general patients that have one of the following: progressive measurable disease; at least one new lesion on bone scan; or biochemical progression as measured by serum PSA during castrate levels of testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Bubley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bubley 1999</LINK>) will be considered hormone refractory. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients will be included as well as trials including patients receiving prior chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, or patients that have not received hormone therapy and therefore may be androgen dependent, will be the subject of a separate review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The agents commonly used include estramustine, vinblastine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin, and prednisone, mostly in combination therapy. Trials reporting chemotherapy combined with hormone therapy will also be assessed in this review. Schedules of any drug dose, routes of administration, and drug or hormone combinations will be reviewed. Trials reporting on the combination of chemotherapy with radioisotopes in hormone refractory prostate cancer will not be addressed but will form the basis of a separate systematic review. Where possible, classes of chemotherapeutic agents will be grouped for analysis. Randomised dose escalation studies were not included for analysis.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcome measures will be overall survival, disease-specific survival, PSA response, and time to progression. The definition of PSA response is a fall of &gt; 50% from pre-treatment levels for two consecutive measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Bubley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bubley 1999</LINK>). Secondary outcome measures include a measurement of pain response, treatment-induced toxicity, and measures of quality of life.</P>

<P>Additional electronic searches of the following databases were conducted: EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Science Citation Index, LILACS, SIGLE as well as searching for Meeting Abstracts and Trials via the National Library of Medicine Gateway web site. Handsearching of recent <I>Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</I> 1996 to 2006, <I>Cancer</I>, <I>Journal of Clinical Oncology</I>, <I>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</I>, <I>Clinical Oncology</I>, <I>British Medical Journal</I>, <I>Cancer Research</I>, <I>Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology</I> was undertaken. In addition, the reference list in each primary reference was scrutinised for additional randomised studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The literature search was screened by two reviewers (MS and CH), and by consensus, with relevant articles retrieved. Data were extracted from each identified paper independently by two or more reviewers and included information on trial design, participants, the type of intervention, and outcome measures. Where necessary, authors of relevant reports were contacted to clarify any queries. The quality of each trial was graded according to the concealment of allocation, adequate descriptions of patient numbers and reasons for patient withdrawal as detailed in the Cochrane Handbook. To quantitate quality, each trial was given a 3 point score based on: 1. the randomisation method; 2. blinding; and 3. description of patient withdrawals. One point was given if the trial was randomised and an additional point given if the method of randomisation was appropriate - for example, central randomisation by telephone. If the intervention allocation was blinded to the investigators, then one point was scored for this category, and one point awarded if the patients who were lost, either to withdrawals or dropouts, were described. </P>
<P>The data will be analysed and described using Review Manager Version 4.2.7 supplied by the Cochrane Collaboration. Data analysis will compare chemotherapy with placebo or control (standard therapy), one chemotherapy regime with another, or chemotherapy with hormone therapy, and comparisons made for each outcome. Comparable outcome data from each trial will be combined in a meta-analysis where possible. For dichotomous data the odds ratio will be calculated with the 95% confidence interval. Trials will be assessed for consistency of effect using chi-squared statistics at a significance level of P &lt; 0.1. A fixed-effect model will be used if there is no evidence of heterogeneity between studies. All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, such as may be reported for pain assessment, summary analysis will be presented as a weighted-mean difference.</P>
<P>The definition of HRPC in each trial will be recorded and a subgroup analysis undertaken to explore the influence of this factor on patient outcome. The reasoning for this is that individuals classified as hormone refractory due to PSA progression are likely to have a much better outcome than those defined according to the number of bony lesions. The trial outcome would therefore bias results in favour of the former group.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Forty-seven trials published between 1977 and 2005 met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although there were no language restrictions on eligibility, all 47 trials were in English. The number of patient randomised in the studies was extremely large, totaling 6929. The chemotherapeutic agents used in these trials were estramustine (n = 21), doxorubicin (n = 14), 5-fluorouracil (n = 14), cyclophosphamide (n = 10), mitoxantrone (n = 6), methotrexate (n = 6), cisplatin (n = 4), docetaxel (n = 4), epirubicin (n = 4), CC-nitrosourea (n =4), mitomycin C (n = 3), vinblastine (n = 3), vincristine (n = 2), paclitaxel (n = 2), oxaliplatin (n = 1), melphalan (n = 1), hydroxyurea (n = 1), etoposide (n =1), peplomycin (n = 1), vinorelbine (n = 1), prednimustine (n = 1) and ixabepilone (n = 1). One trial compared chemotherapy with thalidomide (<LINK REF="STD-Dahut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dahut 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In eight trials the comparative arm was hormone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Anderstrom 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Kernion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Kernion 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rangel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rangel 1992</LINK>), and the included agents were prednisone (n = 2), medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2), hydrocortisone (n = 2), flutamide (n = 1) and ketoconazole (n = 1). A detailed description of the interventions used for all the trials, is presented in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Only five trials compared chemotherapy with either placebo or non-chemotherapy standard treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Iversen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Iversen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tveter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tveter 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of HRPC was reasonably similar for all trials and was generally defined as men with advanced and progressive prostate cancer that had failed to respond to standard hormone therapy. Seven trials stated that disease progression was observed despite castrate level of testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abratt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daliani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daliani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2003</LINK>) ranging from &lt; 0.2 ng/mL to &lt; 50 ng/mL. The definition of disease progression was reported in 24 trials and included the appearance of new lesions (n = 22), an increase in size (generally 25%) of existing lesions (n = 19), an increase in pain (n = 12), a reduction in performance status (n =13) and weight (n = 7), and an increase in PSA levels (n =13). No trial used a rising PSA level as the sole indicator of disease progression.</P>
<P>All trials stated that the included patients had metastatic disease. However, it was not possible to define accurately the frequency of bone metastases because not all trials categorised these data. Where this could be clearly identified (21 trials), the mean number of patients with bone metastases was 85% (range 44% to 100%).</P>
<P>The median age of patients ranged from 55 to 86 years. The baseline performance status was measured using several assessment protocols and included Karnofski 40% to70%, WHO 0% to 2%, ECOG 0% to 3%, SWOG 0% to 3%, and Zubrod &lt; 3%. Thirteen trials reported that patients were symptomatic with an incidence of 59% to 100%.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:10:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the included studies varied, with some studies of high quality, whereas some reported trial findings poorly with important information not available. Of the 6929 patients randomised, 96% were eligible and 91% were evaluable. Nine trials recruited 50 patients or less, 11 recruited 51 to 100 patients and 27 recruited more than 100 patients (101 to 1006).</P>
<P>The scores summarising trial quality are presented in the table describing the characteristics of the included studies (Methods). All trials included in this review were randomised but only 15 described the method of randomisation. Blinding of intervention allocation was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iversen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Iversen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tveter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tveter 1990</LINK>). Blinding was not possible in many cases due to the obvious difference in the schedules of comparative arms. All but three studies detailed the number of patient withdrawals and dropouts (<LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herr-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Herr 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tveter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tveter 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>To account for a potential androgen withdrawal response in the evaluation of chemotherapy for HRPC, 15 trials reported a washout period from androgen deprivation therapy of between 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, no prior chemotherapy was allowed in all but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>One hundred and seven randomised trials of chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer were identified by the search strategy. Of these, sixty trials were excluded, mainly because the recruited patients were not hormone refractory, but the complete list of reasons for exclusion are described in the table of excluded studies. The remaining 47 trials were, therefore, included in this review. One of the analytical aims of this review was to pool the trial data and perform a meta-analysis where possible. However, only two trials compared the same interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>). Since chemotherapeutic agents used to treat prostate cancer have different efficacies and toxicities, it was considered that, as no standard comparative arm was apparent, a meta-analysis with pooling of data was not feasible. Therefore, this review was limited to a quantitative description of the included randomised trials. For clarity, the studies have been categorised according to the drug used, however it must be emphasised, that this is not a definitive grouping, since many trials used several agents and therefore would be eligible for inclusion under a number of drug sections. Each drug category is accompanied by a table summarising data on survival, PSA response and time to disease progression. The details of each trial's aim, methods, participants, interventions and outcomes are tabulated in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>
<B>Estramustine</B>
</P>
<P>Estramustine phosphate is a derivative of estradiol-17-beta and has been used to treat advanced prostate cancer for approximately three decades. It was originally developed by combining oestrogen with the alkylating agent, non-nitrogen mustard. However, its mechanism of action does not appear to be by DNA alkylation, and experimental data suggest that estramustine disrupts cytoplasmic microtubules by binding to the associated proteins and inhibiting the assembly of nuclear matrix.</P>
<P>In this section, 19 randomised trials that have used estramustine in the treatment of patients with HRPC are included. The methodology and patients details are shown in the table 'Characteristics of included studies' (this table contains information on all the included trials for this review). The trials vary considerably in terms of the interventions used, and therefore, are subsectioned to improve clarity.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Estramustine versus Best Supportive Care or Hormones.</B>
</P>
<P>In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, Iversen and colleagues compared the addition of estramustine phosphate plus standard palliative therapy with standard therapy plus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Iversen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Iversen 1997</LINK>). This study enrolled 129 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and progressive disease following orchidectomy. Palliative therapy included analgesics, glucocorticoids and palliative radiotherapy. The data for median overall survival, PSA response (proportion with &gt; 50% decline from baseline) and median time to disease progression for this study, and for all the other studies in the three estramustine sections, are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two arms, nor for the percentage of patients achieving a PSA response. In addition, the median time to progression was similar for both groups. Adverse events were more common in patients receiving estramustine and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and gynaecomastia. Perforated duodenal ulcer was noted in three patients in this group. The data from this trial suggest that estramustine was not superior to placebo in this setting.</P>
<P>To assess the efficacy of single-agent estramustine and the non-steroidal anti-androgen flutamide, the National Prostate Cancer Project (protocol 2400) conducted a prospective randomised trial comparing both agents in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-De-Kernion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Kernion 1988</LINK>). There were no complete regressions seen with either agents based on NPCP criteria, and only one patient receiving flutamide achieved a partial regression. The majority of patients were classified as having stable disease or progression (31% and 62% estramustine, 26% and 69% flutamide). Gastrointestinal toxicities, in particular nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia were severe in 3% to 22% of patients receiving estramustine, and 6% to 23% for the flutamide group. Severe cardiovascular toxicity and oedema were more common with estramustine. There was no significant difference between treatment arms in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival. These data suggest no significant difference in the clinical benefit achieved for patients receiving these agents.</P>
<P>In a Swedish study, Johansson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1991</LINK>) randomised 105 patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer to either estramustine or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). After three months of treatment, more than 50% of patients had progressed, with no significant difference between estramustine or MPA (P = 0.28). During the first year of treatment 70% of the patients had died, again with no statistical difference for survival rates between groups (P = 0.23). Therapy was discontinued in eight patients receiving estramustine because of side effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) and in three patients receiving MPA (oedema, cardiovascular toxicity, and increased pain). Remissions were noted in 13 patients on MPA (12 to 56 weeks) and four on estramustine (22 to 28 weeks) which was reported to be significantly different (P = 0.05). Based on this latter finding, it was concluded that MPA was preferable to estramustine in this category of patients.</P>
<P>A randomised trial from the National Prostate Cancer Project (NPCP protocol 200), evaluated estramustine and streptozotocin as single agents and compared them to standard therapy in patients who had received at least 2000R pelvic irradiation (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1977</LINK>). All had progressive disease following hormonal therapy. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequent toxicities encountered; the collective incidence of which was 59% on the estramustine arm, 50% on the streptozotocin arm, and 33% on the standard therapy. Objective responses, which included patients classified with stable disease and partial regression, were seen in 30%, 32% and 19% of patients receiving estramustine, streptozotocin and standard therapy, respectively. The duration of response was significantly longer for patients on estramustine than for those on streptozotocin or standard therapy (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Survival data were categorised according to response and no overall survival data could be extracted from this paper, although mean survival times were greater for patients benefiting from chemotherapies (17.5 to 20 months for estramustine and streptozotocin versus 10 months for standard therapy). Estramustine was reported to have an advantage over streptozotocin in terms of weight gain, performance status, pain relief and correction from anaemia, but again individual data for each arm were not reported. The authors advocate estramustine.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Single Agent Estramustine versus Single Agent Cytotoxics</B>
</P>
<P>Estramustine was compared to low dose epirubicin in a very small randomised study in prostate cancer patients that had relapsed after hormone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1991</LINK>). Palliation, in terms of pain control and quality of life (National Prostate Cancer Project criteria), was improved in 63% to 68% for both arms. Time to disease progression was similar for both treatment groups and overall survival was the same. There was no grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for either group and gastrointestinal toxicity was restricted to grade 1 or 2 in 43% for estramustine and 36% for epirubicin. Based on practical clinical considerations and cost, the authors recommended estramustine as the first-line treatment for patients with hormone-resistant, painful prostate cancer and epirubicin as second-line treatment. </P>
<P>Single-dose estramustine was compared to single dose mitomycin C for the treatment of HRPC in an EORTC, phase II, randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Newling-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Newling 1993</LINK>). In the schedules used, both agents appeared to be equally ineffective as regards time to disease progression and overall survival (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Toxicity was clinically significant for both agents, and treatment was stopped because of toxicity in 40% of patients receiving estramustine (mainly gastrointestinal) and 32% for mitomycin C (mainly marrow suppression). Multivariate analysis suggested that WHO performance status and pain at entry were important prognostic factors in determining the duration of survival.</P>
<P>A randomised study by Loening et al (<LINK REF="STD-Loening-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1983</LINK>) evaluated estramustine, methotrexate and cisplatin as single agents in HRPC patients. The main outcomes were objective and subjective responses based on the National Prostate Cancer project criteria. There was only one complete objective response to methotrexate, whereas those classified as progressing at 12 weeks, included 66% on estramustine, 59% on methotrexate and 64% for cisplatin. Performance status was similar for the three arms, although more patients on methotrexate (19%) and cisplatin (22%) had an improvement of pain compared to estramustine (6%). Median survival times were not significantly different for each group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Nausea, vomiting and anorexia were the major side effects for estramustine, but to a lesser extent than for cisplatin. Methotrexate was less toxic but stomatitis and leukopenia were seen with this agent. This trial did not demonstrate the superiority for any of the three agents tested but methotrexate was advocated for further study due to its best overall response.</P>
<P>Two additional studies included in this subsection combine hormone therapy with a cytotoxic as the comparative arm. The first trial, <LINK REF="STD-Anderstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Anderstrom 1995</LINK>, evaluated the time to disease progression in HRPC patients randomised to receive either estramustine alone or medroxyprogesterone acetate plus epirubicin (MPA/E). The estimated probability of being free from progression at one year was 17% and 29% for estramustine and MPA/E, respectively. The risk of progression was significantly less with the combination arm (P = 0.013). However, no difference was observed for overall survival, with approximately 40% of patients alive in both arms at 1 year. Significant cardiotoxicity was seen in both groups with heart failure occurring in 9 of 74 patients on estramustine (12%) and 8 of 75 on MPA/E (11%). Nausea and vomiting were more common with estramustine (19% versus 7%). The authors conclude that the combination regime, whilst delaying disease progression has no affect on survival, and that the degree of cardiotoxicity should be considered before treatment.</P>
<P>The second study was a small, placebo controlled, randomised trial from Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Tveter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tveter 1990</LINK>), and compared estramustine to low dose epirubicin plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA/E) and epirubicin plus matched placebo (E/P). Epirubicin, either with placebo or in combination with MPA induced a significantly improved pain relief compared to estramustine (P &lt; 0.05). Patients with severe pain on entry and having the greatest analgesic intake (score 3) experienced better palliation than those with moderate pain (score 2). The combination of MPA/E also significantly improved performance status compared to estramustine and E/P (P &lt; 0.05). No toxicity data were reported, although it was stated that no haematological complications occurred in any arm. Low dose epirubicin in combination with MPA provides good palliation for symptomatic metastatic cancer of the prostate. </P>
<P>
<B>3. Estramustine plus a cytotoxic agent versus other cytotoxics.</B>
</P>
<P>Albrecht and colleagues reported on a randomised phase II study in progressive hormone-escaped metastatic prostate cancer patients, comparing estramustine alone with estramustine plus vinblastine (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 2004</LINK>). The main endpoints were PSA response, overall survival and toxicity. The PSA responses were poor with less than 30% of patients in each arm achieving a 50% decrease from baseline. Overall survival was not significantly different between groups and showed no correlation with PSA response. The toxicity of these regimes was substantial and resulted in 40% of patients withdrawing from treatment. Estramustine either alone or in combination was not be recommended for the routine treatment of patients with HRPC.</P>
<P>Oral estramustine in combination with the vinca alkaloid, vinblastine, was compared to vinblastine alone in a randomised trial of 201 patients with HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Hudes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hudes 1999</LINK>). The combination significantly reduced the time to disease progression, and significantly, more patients in this arm had a reduction in PSA of at least 50% from baseline. However, no difference in overall survival was observed between groups. Nausea, vomiting and leg oedema were significantly greater with the combination schedule. Attempts to assess quality of life and pain response were disappointing due to the limited amount of data that were obtained, thus no reliable conclusion could be drawn from this study on these outcomes.</P>
<P>Soloway and associates (<LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1981</LINK>) evaluated estramustine phosphate and vincristine alone and compared them with a combination of these two agents in previously irradiated men with HRPC. All patients had received at least 2000R to the pelvis and had documented progression after orchidectomy or hormone therapy. Response to therapy was assessed using the National Prostate Cancer Project criteria. The study was poorly reported and limited data were extractable. The median duration of response for those patients responding was not significantly different for estramustine (20 weeks) and vincristine (22 weeks), and was less for the combination arm (13 weeks). Survival, based on evaluable patients, was similar for each arm (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Anaemia was clinically significant and occurred in all treatment groups (26% to 38%) with nausea and vomiting (42% to 59%) and neurological disturbances (30% to 50%) being prominent. No advantage was found for the combination of these agents compared to single-agent administration. </P>
<P>The same group also investigated single-agent estramustine and cisplatin and compared these with a combination of both drugs, again in previously irradiated men with progressive HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1983</LINK>). This was the fourth randomised study from the National Prostate Cancer Project (NPCP). This had a cross-over, trial design at disease progression, and analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis and for evaluable patients. The results indicated no significant difference in overall survival or objective progression rates for the three treatment groups. Ninety-two per cent of patients had pain on study entry, which improved in 32% receiving estramustine, 36% receiving cisplatin and in 44% for the combination group. Improvements in performance status occurred in 5%, 7% and 12%, respectively, with no statistically significant differences. The main side effects were nausea and vomiting for all groups (62% to 88%) and accompanying anorexia (75% to 95%). The side effects were severe in 29% of those patients receiving the combination compared to 12% and 14% for estramustine and cisplatin, respectively. An additive effect of the combination on objective response rates was suggested but the evidence was not compelling.</P>
<P>One hundred and sixty-three patients with HRPC were randomised to either estramustine plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone in a recent phase II study (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2004</LINK>). This study was undertaken to determine the response rates and safety of these regimes in patients with progressive disease. Partial responses were seen in 37 patients receiving the combination and in 22 patients on estramustine alone. These respective response rates were significantly different (47% versus 27%, P &lt; 0.001) although the median durations were similar (115.1 months versus 115.5 months). Overall survival was also improved with the combination regime and was marginally statistically significant (P = 0.049). The main adverse events observed with estramustine/paclitaxel combination and paclitaxel alone schedule were respectively, gastrointestinal 20% and 8%, asthenia 15% and 16%, neuropathy 10% and 7%, and neutropenia 6% and 13%. Four patients experienced thromboembolic events with the combination. In terms of response and survival, the combination of the two microtubule inhibitors has shown some encouraging results.</P>
<P>Estramustine was combined with the cytotoxic tubulin-polymerising agent, ixabepilone, in a phase II randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Galsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galsky 2005</LINK>). Ninety-two patients were randomised to a combination of both agents or to ixabepilone alone. The main outcome of interest was PSA response. In 45 HRPC patients receiving ixabepilone plus estramustine, 31 (69%) had a &gt; 50% decline in PSA in relation to baseline levels, compared to 21 of 44 (48%) for ixabepilone alone. Partial PSA responses were seen in 48% and 32%, respectively, for those patients with measurable disease; however, the majority of these were not confirmed with a CT or MRI scan. Time to PSA progression was short and similar between groups (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). No overall survival data were presented. Grade 3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 29% and 8% for the combination, and 22% and 4% for the patients receiving ixabepilone alone. Peripheral neuropathy was common and was seen in 73% and 67% for the combination and single agent arms, respectively. The study authors advocate further evaluation of ixabepilone, but the conclusions are based mainly on the surrogate marker PSA, and does not present any P values.</P>
<P>The combination of estramustine plus prednimustine was compared to prednimustine alone in HRPC patients who had previously received extensive radiotherapy to the pelvis (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1979</LINK>). The rationale for this study (protocol 400) was to evaluate a minimally myelosuppressive regime in patients who had already received myelosuppressive therapy. Pain relief was experienced by 37% of patients in the combination arm and 32% with prednimustine alone. The respective performance status was improved or the patient remained ambulatory in 40% and 37% of cases. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects ( 57% for the combination and 47% for the prednimustine group), although haematological toxicities were reported to be similar in each arm and of minor clinical importance. Six patients (11.5%) on the combination and 11 patients (18%) on prednimustine alone had a white blood counts that decreased to &lt; 3000 per mm<SUP>3</SUP> at some point in their treatment. The overall survival at the end of one year was not significantly different between groups and no reduction in tumour mass (&gt; 50%) was seen in either group. Some palliation of symptoms was seen with these two regimes but no survival advantage was identified.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Complex Combination Chemotherapy with Estramustine.</B>
</P>
<P>Estramustine plus etoposide (E/E) were compared with a combination of lanreotide (somatostatin analogue), triptorelin (LHRH analogue) and dexamethasone (L/T/D) in a small, phase II, randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Dimopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimopoulos 2004</LINK>). Patients had advanced prostate cancer that was progressing despite androgen deprivation. The percentage of patients achieving a PSA response was similar in each arm (12/20 E/E versus 12/18 L/T/D) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Changes in performance status (31% improved on E/E versus 41% on L/T/D) and response to pain relief (61% E/E versus 56% L/T/D) were not significantly different between groups. The time to disease progression and overall survival were similar for both regimes. Significant haematological toxicity (80% of patients) and gastrointestinal toxicity (50% of patients) were seen with the chemotherapy arm only (E/E). It was concluded that the combination treatment (L/T/D) may offer a safer alternative to chemotherapy in this clinical setting. </P>
<P>In a Japanese study, Akaza et al (<LINK REF="STD-Akaza-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Akaza 1988</LINK>) evaluated estramustine in combination with peplomycin and doxorubicin, and compared this regime to 5-fluorouracil plus peplomycin plus doxorubicin in a subgroup of patients with HRPC. This trial reported two groups of patients: previously untreated patients and 44 patients who were anti-androgen treatment refractory. The latter group was randomised to the above schedules and is discussed below. The primary outcome of interest was tumour response, categorised according to primary lesion response and osteoblastic lesion response. Overall survival was also determined. No patient had a complete objective response to either regime, and only three cases receiving 5-fluorouracil, peplomycin and doxorubicin achieved a partial response with respect to the primary lesion. Only one patient in the study, from the same group, achieved a partial response with regard to bone metastases evaluation. In the comparison of survival times, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The dose of estramustine was not reported, nor were any toxicity data or quality of life data. The results of this study suggest that the combination of agents used have poor efficacy and survival rates in HRPC patients.</P>
<P>Finally, in a recent randomised, multicentre, phase II study, estramustine was a component in a multi-agent comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2003</LINK>). Patients with progressive androgen- independent prostate cancer were randomised to alternating regimens of estramustine/vinblastine and ketoconazole/doxorubicin (EV/KD) or a combination of estramustine/paclitaxel/etoposide (EPE). As expected, these intensive cytotoxic regimens were difficult to deliver and toxic. Thromboembolic events with estramustine were seen in 27% of patients, which included deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary oedema. Grade 4 toxicities occurred with both regimens and included stomatitis, sensory neuropathy, supraventricular tachycardia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia. There were nine early deaths (13%), four by complications of neutropenia, four by rapid disease progression, and one myocardial infarction. Neither response rates (47% EV/KD, 36% EPE) nor survival times differed significantly between treatment groups. Not surprisingly, neither regimen was recommended for further evaluation. </P>
<P>
<B>Cyclophosphamide</B>
</P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that requires hepatic metabolism for conversion to an active alkylating agent with properties similar to those of mustine. It is used as a single agent and in combination chemotherapy for a number of leukaemias and lymphomas as well as solid tumours such as prostate cancer. The present review identified 10 randomised trials using cyclophosphamide for HRPC. In six of these trials, cyclophosphamide was used as a single agent (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlebowski-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chlebowski 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loening-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Muss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasimis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kasimis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Saxman 1992</LINK>). In two trials it was combined with another cytotoxic (<LINK REF="STD-Page-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), and in two other trials it was combined with several agents (<LINK REF="STD-Herr-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Herr 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1986</LINK>). The clinical data for these studies are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The first randomised trial to evaluate cyclophosphamide as a single agent was that of the National Prostate Cancer Project (NPCP protocol 100, <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>). Cyclophosphamide was compared to 5-fluorouracil or standard palliative therapy in patients with stage D prostate cancer. All had disease progression and had failed to respond or had relapsed following hormone therapy. The proportion of patients responding was greater for both chemotherapy arms and were 46%, 36% and 19% for cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and standard therapy, respectively (see table of 'Included studies' for response definitions). The difference was statistically different for cyclophosphamide compared to standard therapy (P &lt; 0.02). The survival of responding patients on the chemotherapy arms was longer than for responding patients on standard therapy. However, the survival data were presented by response group, and it was not possible to derive a summary statistic for this study.</P>
<P>The efficacy of single agent cyclophosphamide was compared, in a very small trial, with the combination of cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Chlebowski-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chlebowski 1978</LINK>). Similar numbers of patients receiving cyclophosphamide alone achieved an objective response (NPCP criteria) compared to the combination arm (53% versus 50%). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups, although those patients responding to cyclophosphamide alone survived significantly longer than non-responders (P &lt; 0.01), but this was not the case in the combination arm. Nausea and vomiting were the most common toxicities of clinical significance (grade not given) and were observed in approximately 60% of patient in both regimens. One patient in each arm had severe granulocytopenia but there were no treatment-related deaths. Single agent cyclophosphamide appeared equivalent to the combination with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil in the advanced cancer patients.</P>
<P>Another randomised study evaluated single agent cyclophosphamide. This time it was compared to methyl-CCNU alone or hydroxyurea alone in patients with relapsing clinical stage D prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Loening-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1981</LINK>). Objective responses (NPCP criteria) evaluated 12 weeks after therapy initiation, were 35% for cyclophosphamide, 15% for hydroxyurea and 30% for methyl-CCNU; these were not significantly different statistically. The respective values for disease progression were 65%, 86%, and 70%. Performance status was improved in 18% of patients on hydroxyurea compared to 12% and 4% for cyclophosphamide and methyl-CCNU, respectively. Pain relief was improved in 20% of patients in each arm. None of the treatment comparisons were significantly different.</P>
<P>A very small, randomised, study compared cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in advanced cancer prostate cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Muss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Muss 1981</LINK>).<BR/>Response rates, using NPCP criteria, were 53% with single agent cyclophosphamide and 54% in patients receiving the combination chemotherapy. For both treatment arms, the responding patients had a significantly longer survival compared to non-responders (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in duration of response (P = 0.76) nor overall survival (P = 0.39) for patients in either arm. This study aimed to recruit 50 patients to detect a 20% difference in response rates, but was closed early due to a lack of significant benefit of the combination regimen.</P>
<P>Preliminary results of a randomised, crossover trial were reported by Kasimis and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Kasimis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kasimis 1985</LINK>), comparing cyclophosphamide with a combination regimen of 5-fluorouracil plus doxorubicin plus mitomycin C. This was another small study with primary objectives of response (NPCP criteria) and toxicity. No survival data were available. There was no significant difference in the overall objective response rates between groups (P = 0.72), however, the median time to disease progression was significantly longer with the combination arm (P = 0.007). Twenty-five percent of patients on cyclophosphamide alone and 64% receiving the combination chemotherapy achieved a 'remarkable' relief of pain<BR/>(P &lt;0.01), and was associated with a reduction in analgesic consumption and an improved performance status. One of 15 patients receiving the combination treatment died of sepsis due to neutropenia and five (35%) developed mild to severe mucositis. Nausea and vomiting were more common with cyclophosphamide alone (75% and 56%, respectively) compared to the combination (43% nausea only). No follow-up publication of this trial has been identified.</P>
<P>The Hoosier Oncology Group randomised patients with advanced prostate cancer to cyclophosphamide alone or combined with doxorubicin plus methotrexate (CAM) to determine whether a survival advantage could be achieved with the combination therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Saxman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Saxman 1992</LINK>). There were no complete responses to chemotherapy and only 2% and 6% of patients achieved a partial response to cyclophosphamide alone and the combination regimen, respectively. Overall progression occurred in 57% of patients and was not significantly prolonged with CAM (P = 0.07). Overall survival, on an intention-to-treat basis, was very similar for each treatment group (P = 0.7) suggesting that the combination chemotherapy was of minimal value to the majority of patients.</P>
<P>Two randomised trials combined cyclophosphamide with another cytotoxic agent as one of the comparative arms. The first evaluated cyclophosphamide plus 5-fluorouracil against doxorubicin plus lomustine in a small group of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Page-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1985</LINK>). Objective response rates (partial response plus stable disease - NPCP criteria) occurred in 52% and 71% of patients, respectively (P = 0.17), whereas subjective response rates (see table of 'Included studies' for definitions) were observed in 48% and 82% of patients (P = 0.03). This was not translated into a significant difference in overall survival between groups (P = 0.46). Major toxic effects were myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting which were of similar frequency and severity in each group. The combination may have had superior palliative activity but no survival advantage.</P>
<P>The second randomised trial combined cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin, and compared this regime to single agent methotrexate, and a combined arm of cyclophosphamide plus 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>). Myelosuppression was of similar frequency and severity across all three arms (anaemia 32% to 34%, WBC 28% to 42%, platelets 4% to 14%). Nausea and vomiting was less prevalent with methotrexate than with the other two arms (P &lt; 0.02). There were no complete regressions and only one partial regression on the methotrexate arm. Survival analysis indicated that 105 of 152 patients had died (69%) with no significant difference between regimens. Also progression-free survival data showed that 84% of patients had failed, again with no significant difference between these treatments. These data do not provide encouragement to further investigate these regimens.</P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide was combined with two other cytotoxic agents as a comparative arm in a small randomised trial reported by Herr (<LINK REF="STD-Herr-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Herr 1982</LINK>). Forty patients with HRPC were randomised to receive either cyclophosphamide plus methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil or chloroethyl-CCNU alone (20 patients in each arm). Response to treatment was poor with only three partial responses achieved in the combination arm. The proportion of patients classed as having disease progression was 65% and 70% for the combination and chloroethyl-CCNU, respectively. Overall survival was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. These regimen appear to be minimally effective in endocrine resistant advanced prostate cancer.</P>
<P>Finally, one randomised trial, in which cyclophosphamide was combined with three other agents, was published by the Emory University Clinic Atlanta, Georgia (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1986</LINK>). In this study cyclophosphamide was combined with methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil and prednisone, and was compared with another multi-agent arm comprising methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, prednisone, vincristine and melphalan. The description of the toxicities associated with each arm was limited but indicated that gastrointestinal and haematological complications were most common and equivalent in each group. Response rates were equal for each of the two groups (37% versus 36%). Overall survival was not significantly different for patients receiving either of these complex multi-agent regimens.</P>
<P>
<B> 5-Fluorouracil</B>
</P>
<P>5-Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite that is indicated for the palliation of a variety of carcinomas both alone and in combination with other agents. The literature search identified four relevant randomised trials that reported on the use of 5-fluorouracil in the treatment HRPC patients (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Three studies used single agent 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daliani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daliani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>), whereas one combined 5-fluorouracil with oxaliplatin (<LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The South Eastern Cancer Study Group evaluated single agent 5-fluorouracil and the combination of 5-fluorouracil plus cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in both HRPC patients and in patients with advanced bladder cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>). This review was only concerned with the prostate cancer group. There appeared to be no significant difference in overall survival for the prostate cancer patients receiving either treatment for evaluable patients or on an intention-to-treat basis. The majority of those receiving the combination regime experienced nausea and vomiting after each dose. Although the granulocyte count decreased below &lt; 1500/mm<SUP>3</SUP> following combination chemotherapy, a rebound occurred within 4 days and was rarely of clinical significance. Patients with prostate cancer were evaluated for response using either placental alkaline phosphatase levels or the NPCP criteria for objective response. However, the data presented varied according to the method of measurement making it difficult to summarise the response results.</P>
<P>When 5-fluorouracil was combined with interferon-&#945; minimal anti-tumour activity was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Daliani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daliani 1995</LINK>). In this small phase II trial there was no significant difference in the extent or duration of response, nor in overall survival for either treatment group. Both regimes induced significant toxicity, principally mucositis and neurotoxicity and three treatment-related deaths occurred in the 5-fluorouracil alone arm. The authors conclude that these regimes are inactive in prostate cancer and should not be tested in further trials.</P>
<P>Monotherapy with 5-fluorouracil was compared to 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid in a small German prospective randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>). Pain, assessed by scoring the intensity and frequency, was not completely alleviated in any patient; however, 78% on 5-fluorouracil alone and 58% on the combination experienced mild to moderate pain relief. Side effects were mainly gastrointestinal (stomatitis and diarrhoea and were more common in the combination arm (grades 1 to 4, 11 versus 5). Haematological toxicities (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) were more frequent with the 5-fluorouracil monotherapy (grades 1 to 4, 15 versus 9). There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms in terms of time to disease progression and overall survival. Clinical response did not always correlate with PSA response with some patients experiencing increasing pain and a deterioration of performance status with decreasing PSA levels, whilst others had increasing PSA levels and good a clinical response.</P>
<P>The benefit of adding 5-fluorouracil to oxaliplatin was evaluated in a recent small phase II randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>). Twenty-six patients received oxaliplatin alone and 28 received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil There were no complete responses in either treatment arm (assessed by pain, performance status, weight gain, and PSA levels), although 11% and 19% had a PSA partial response (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) to single agent oxaliplatin and the 5-fluorouracil combination, respectively. No difference in overall survival was observed between the two groups. Respective grade 3 and 4 toxicities for oxaliplatin and oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil include anaemia (19% versus 32%), stomatitis (0% versus 4%), asthenia (4% versus 7%) and neurotoxicity (4% versus 11%). Based on objective response rates and clinical benefit (12% and 39%) further study using the combination is warranted.</P>
<P>
<B>Doxorubicin </B>
</P>
<P>Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a cytotoxic antibiotic that forms stable complexes with DNA and interferes with the synthesis of nucleic acids. It has shown clinical activity in many malignancies such as acute leukaemias, lymphomas, paediatric malignancies as well as adult solid tumours especially breast and lung carcinomas. It has also been evaluated for activity in men with advanced prostate cancer. </P>
<P>Six randomised trials using doxorubicin in HRPC patients are included in this section (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). In three trials doxorubicin was used as a single agent (<LINK REF="STD-Torti-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Torti 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Francini 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leaf-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 2003</LINK>). In two trials it was combined with another agent (<LINK REF="STD-Rangel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rangel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2001</LINK>), and in one trial it was combined with two other cytotoxics (<LINK REF="STD-Laurie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Laurie 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first trial was very small, with 37 patients with HRPC randomised to receive either doxorubicin or doxorubicin plus cisplatin (<LINK REF="STD-Torti-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Torti 1985</LINK>). Tumour response was assessed using the NCOG criteria which requires a 75% reduction in the primary tumour to be classified as a partial response. Using this definition, 20% responded in the doxorubicin arm and 14% in the combination arm. Twenty-seven percent of patients in the doxorubicin alone arm achieved some pain relief (NCOG Pain Status Scale) compared to 40% when combined with cisplatin. Toxicity was severe, particularly with the combination regimen where thrombocytopenia was dose limiting. Nausea and vomiting were common in both groups and dose limiting in patients on both arms. Time to disease progression and overall survival were similar for both treatment groups (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another small randomised trial compared single agent doxorubicin with epirubicin, testing the hypothesis that weekly epirubicin would have less side effects and decreased cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Francini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Francini 1993</LINK>). The main adverse effects were cardiotoxicity and myelosuppression but were less frequent with epirubicin. Cardiotoxicity occurred in 11% of patients in the epirubicin arm and 48% in the doxorubicin arm. Grade 2 to 3 leukopenia was 18% and 52%, respectively, and grade 2 to 3 anaemia was 16% and 57%. After 24 months of follow up, overall survival was significantly improved with epirubicin compared to doxorubicin (P = 0.042). Response, which included an assessment of pain and performance status, was 20% for epirubicin and 15% for doxorubicin. These data suggest that epirubicin is as effective as doxorubicin in terms of palliation but with fewer side effects.</P>
<P>A phase II, multicentre, randomised study, set up by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), was designed to evaluate doxorubicin as a single agent compared with doxorubicin combined with diethlystilbestrol (DES) in men with HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Leaf-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 2003</LINK>). This trial was initiated in 1983 but not published until 2003. There appears to be no clinical advantage, in terms of response for patients treated with doxorubicin alone compared to those receiving the combination (21% versus 24%, P = 0.70). The combination arm was more toxic, with 7% of patients experiencing severe cardiotoxicity (7% versus 1%) and thrombosis with pulmonary embolism (7% versus 0%). The addition of DES to doxorubicin did not improve overall survival in these patients and it was concluded that there was no clinical benefit with the combination regimen.</P>
<P>Single agent doxorubicin given weekly and combined with prednisone was compared to prednisone alone in a randomised study of 110 patients with HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Rangel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rangel 1992</LINK>). A significant number of patients receiving the combination achieved a subjective response (P = 0.01) and had evidence of stable disease (P = 0.02). However, overall survival was not improved by the addition of doxorubicin to prednisone (P = 0.26). The weekly regime of doxorubicin was well tolerated although cardiotoxicity was noted in approximately 15% of patients. Weekly doxorubicin, although of subjective benefit, did not provide a substantive advantage to these patients.</P>
<P>A phase II randomised study, initiated by the MD Anderson Cancer Centre, was set up to define response rates and survival of men with HRPC receiving either doxorubicin plus ketoconazole or ketoconazole alone (<LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2001</LINK>). All patients had progressive disease despite castrate levels of testosterone. Patients with metastatic disease involving the long bones or viscera faired significantly worse than those with disease confined to the axial skeleton. Both regimens were associated with grade 3-4 toxicities including haematological (mainly doxorubicin arm), anorexia, nausea with vomiting, stomatitis and fatigue (mainly doxorubicin arm). Additionally, patients who had a PSA response, had an improved survival. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in overall survival or time to disease progression. Neither regimen was recommended for further assessment in a phase III trial setting.</P>
<P>Laurie et al (<LINK REF="STD-Laurie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Laurie 1992</LINK>) reported on a randomised trial in which combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C was compared to sequential therapy with the same agents given at full dose. One hundred and forty-five patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer with progressive disease following hormone therapy were recruited with primary trial endpoints of response rates and survival. In the sequential arm, mitomycin C was given first followed by doxorubicin when disease progression occurred and then 5-fluorouracil. Objective responses were seen in 10/72 (14%) of patient receiving the combination schedule and 13/72 (18%) in the sequential chemotherapy arm. The median duration of response was 209 days for the combination arm, 219 days for responders to mitomycin (as measured from the initiation of therapy), and 119 days for responders to doxorubicin. When the study terminated, 141 patients had died and there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = 0.25). Myelosuppression was the major toxicity in both arms with severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia observed in 64% and 21% of patients randomised to the combination and sequential chemotherapy, respectively. The corresponding values for patients responding to mitomycin C, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil alone were 7% and 14%, 52% and 30%, and 75% and 25%. These data suggest that the schedules used in this study are of minor clinical importance for the treatment of HRPC.</P>
<P>
<B>Mitoxantrone</B>
</P>
<P>Mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione structurally similar to doxorubicin, was synthesized in the 1970s, and has been used to treat leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and to a lesser extent, advanced prostate cancer. The exact mechanism of action is unknown but includes intercalation with DNA to cause inter/intrastrand cross-linking. It also causes DNA strand breaks through binding with the phosphate backbone of DNA. Mitoxantrone is cell cycle phase-nonspecific. </P>
<P>Three randomised trials using mitoxantrone in HRPC patients have been included in this section (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). In one trial mitoxantrone was combined with hydrocortisone as one of the comparative arms (<LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>), and in two trials mitoxantrone was combined with prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Kantoff et al combined mitoxantrone with hydrocortisone and compared this combination with hydrocortisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>). Although patients receiving the combination had a small but statistically significant delay in time to disease progression (P = 0.02), there was no difference in overall survival. There was an indication of a better quality of life in the combination arm based on emotional state (P = 0.04), family disruption (P = 0.02), and two pain criteria (frequency P = 0.06 and severity P = 0.03), although symptom distress, sexual and urological function favoured the hydrocortisone alone arm. Grade 3-4 cardiotoxicity was found in 5% of patients receiving mitoxantrone, in addition, haematological toxicity was significantly greater in this treatment group.</P>
<P>The palliative activity of mitoxantrone combined with prednisone was evaluated in a Canadian randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>). Compared to prednisone alone, the palliative response, as measured by a 2 point decrease in a 6-point pain intensity scale, was significantly in favour of the combination (29% versus 12%, P = 0.01). Responding patients generally had an improvement in quality-of-life scales. The major toxicities were associated with mitoxantrone and include grade 3/4 neutropenia (7%), nausea and vomiting, alopecia (24%) and cardiotoxicity (66%). Although a significant palliative response was seen with the combination, there was no difference in overall survival.</P>
<P>A similar study, comparing mitoxantrone plus prednisone with prednisone alone, was undertaken in asymptomatic men with HRPC, with time to treatment failure as the primary endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>). At a median follow up of 22 months, the combination regime significantly delayed the time to disease progression (P = 0.018) and increased the number of patients achieving a &gt; 50% decrease in PSA levels (P = 0.007). However, as with the previous study, there was no significant difference in overall survival.</P>
<P>
<B>Docetaxel</B>
</P>
<P>Docetaxel (Taxetere) is a semi-synthetic analogue of taxol (Paclitaxal) which is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. Docetaxel is used for the treatment of certain forms of breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer. It kills tumour cells by disrupting the function of cellular microtubules, which are essential structures for cell morphology and division and, therefore, survival. Four randomised studies of docetaxel for advanced prostate cancer have been included in this section with a summary of the trial data described in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
<P>Single-agent docetaxel was compared to the combination of docetaxel plus thalidomide in a randomised phase II trial of 75 patients with androgen independent prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Dahut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dahut 2004</LINK>). Thalidomide (&#945;-N-[phalimido] glutamide) was initially developed as a sedative about 30 years ago but induced foetal limb malformation (dysmelia) and was withdrawn from the market. However, the rationale for investigating this agent is that prostate cancer tissue is highly vascularised compared to the adjacent benign tissue, as shown by microvessel density studies, and thalidomide has anti-angiogenic activity (reduces blood vessel formation). It has also been reported that thalidomide has activity in androgen independent prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Figg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Figg 2001</LINK>). In the present study patients received either weekly docetaxel alone or in combination with daily thalidomide. After a median follow up of 26 .4 months, more patients on the combination arm had a PSA response (difference between arms of 16%) and experienced a greater delay in progression-free interval (difference between medians 2.2 months) and had an improved overall survival (median difference 25.3 months). Although these results are encouraging there was no statistical significance observed. Grade 3 haematological toxicity was seen in less than 4% of patients in each arm. Other side effects were common (20% to 80%) and included grade 1-2 gastrointestinal toxicity, fatigue, oedema, sensory disturbances, pleural effusion and depressed consciousness. Thromboembolic events with thalidomide were of concern and anti-coagulant therapy (heparin) was given prophylactically after 12 of 43 patients in the combined group developed either vein thrombosis (n = 9) or transient ischaemic attack or shock (n = 9). Thalidomide did not alter the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel with the respective area under the curve. The plasma clearance for the single agent was 1062 ngh/mL and 34.8 L/h/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and 1168 ng.h/mL and 29.3 L/h/m<SUP>2</SUP> for the combination arm.</P>
<P>A three-arm, prospective, phase II, randomised study was designed to evaluate 2 schedules of docetaxel (70 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> and 35 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) plus estramustine and prednisone versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone in hormone refractory prostate cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Oudard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oudard 2005</LINK>). The respective proportion of patients with a PSA decline of &gt; 50% and the time to disease progression were significantly greater and significantly longer for patients receiving docetaxel (P &lt; 0.00001 in both cases). Although the median overall survival was greater for the docetaxel arms, it was not significantly different between regimens. Multivariate analysis of prognostic variables suggested a significant association between survival and ECOG performance status (P = 0.0001) and baseline haemoglobin (P = 0.006). The pain index, as assessed by the McGill questionnaire, was not significantly different between the three arms, although there was an improvement in the 70mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> and 35 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> docetaxel arms compared to the mitoxantrone arm (40% and 29% versus 17%, respectively). However, a significant improvement in ECOG performance status was seen with docetaxel (60% and 48% versus 28%, respectively). Grade 3-4 granulocytopenia was the most common toxicity in the 70mg/m<SUP>2 </SUP> docetaxel and mitoxantrone arms (37% and 48%, respectively) although this was not observed with the lower dose of docetaxel. Gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3-4) occurred in 0% to 7% of patients and was not clinically significant. Thrombosis caused by estramustine, was seen in 7% in both the docetaxel arms despite anti-coagulant therapy. The authors suggest that further studies on the combination of docetaxel are warranted.</P>
<P>Overall survival was the primary endpoint in a randomised trial comparing mitoxantrone plus prednisone (considered to be the standard palliative therapy) with 2 schedules of docetaxel plus prednisone in 1006 men with HRPC (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>). Docetaxel was administered using a weekly or a three-weekly schedule. When compared to the mitoxantrone arm, the hazard ratios for death in the three weekly docetaxel arm was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, P = 0.009) and that for the weekly schedule was 0.91 ( 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11, P = 0.36). This indicates a statistically significant improvement in overall survival with the three-weekly docetaxel regime with a 24% reduction in the risk of death. In addition, a significant reduction in pain was observed in patients receiving the three weekly docetaxel regimen compared to the mitoxantrone arm (35% versus 22%, P = 0.01) but not with the weekly schedule (31%), although the median duration of pain response (3.5 to 5.6 months) was not significantly different between groups. Also the quality of life assessment showed a significant improvement with the three weekly schedule of docetaxel than among those treated with mitoxantrone (22% versus 13%, P = 0.009). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was significantly more common with the three weekly docetaxel (32%) than for those patients receiving weekly docetaxel or mitoxantrone (2% and 22%), although the frequency of febrile neutropenia was less than 4% in all arms. Nausea and vomiting were common with all regimens (38% to 42%) and diarrhoea was significantly more frequent with both docetaxel schedules. Discontinuation of treatment with docetaxel was due to fatigue, musculoskeletal events, nail changes, sensory neuropathy, and infection whereas for mitoxantrone cardiac dysfunction was the major reason.</P>
<P>In a fourth randomised trial compared mitoxantrone plus prednisone with docetaxel plus estramustine in patients with HRPC with overall survival as the primary endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-Petrylak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Petrylak 2004</LINK>). The results indicated a significant improvement in overall survival, median time to disease progression, and the percentage of patients achieving a PSA response for the docetaxel - estramustine arm. However, this regime was significantly more toxic in terms of gastrointestinal side effects (P = 0.001), nausea and vomiting (P = 0.001), infection (P = 0.004), metabolic toxicity (P &lt; 0.001) and neurological dysfunction (P = 0.001). It should also be noted that there was no significant difference in pain relief between the two groups as assessed by the patients. </P>
<P>
<B>Vinorelbine</B>
</P>
<P>Vinorelbine is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent classified as a vinca alkaloid, which are derived from the Jamaican Periwinkle. This compound is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid and inhibits tumour cell growth by disrupting the function of microtubules, but by a different mechanism from that of docetaxel. One randomised phase III trial has investigated the efficacy of vinorelbine in patients with HRPC, in which vinorelbine was combined with hydrocortisone and compared to hydrocortisone plus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Abratt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 2004</LINK>). The primary end point of this study was progression-free survival (PFS) and was reported to be significantly in favour of the vinorelbine arm (P = 0.007). The median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.8 to 4.3) for vinorelbine and 2.8 months (95% CI 2.2 to 3.5) for the placebo group with respective PFS rates at 6 months of 33.2% and 22.8%. At a median follow up of 24 months, the overall survival was virtually the same for both groups; the survival curves were superimposable (median 14.7 months, vinorelbine versus 15.2 months for placebo). This is despite significantly better PSA responses with vinorelbine (30.1% versus 19.2%, P = 0.01). The mean score for quality of life, including a global score of quality, a functional scale and a symptom scale, showed no significant changes between the two treatment arms. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was seen in 26% of patients receiving vinorelbine compared to 0% for placebo. Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, infection, vomiting, fatigue, alopecia and neurotoxicity were all more frequently experienced in patients randomised to vinorelbine. It was suggested that vinorelbine has a role in treating HRPC patients who have failed taxane therapy, but the poor overall survival data suggest a minimum clinical advantage for these elderly men.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:13:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In Europe, the estimated number of deaths from metastatic prostate cancer for the year 1998 was 56,035 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>), whilst the calculated figure for the United States of America was 37,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 1998</LINK>). During the latter stages of this disease, greater than 80% of patients experience progressive pain associated with bone metastases, and which can impact considerably on the patients' quality of life. These tragic statistics have motivated extensive clinical research into this condition, in particular, the palliative use of systemic chemotherapy. The present review identified over 100 randomised trials of chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer, 47 of which were eligible for inclusion. It is surprising, that even with this large number of trials, few compared the same chemotherapeutic regimes and, therefore, the conclusions drawn from the trial data are based on quantitative description rather than from more robust meta-analytical summaries.</P>
<P>Not all trials reported the primary review outcome of overall survival, because either the trials were designed as a phase II study, where safety and response were the main objectives (<LINK REF="STD-Galsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galsky 2005</LINK>), or where the follow-up times were insufficient (<LINK REF="STD-Kasimis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kasimis 1985</LINK>) . In other trials overall survival data were poorly reported (<LINK REF="STD-De-Kernion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Kernion 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>). For those trials where data were available and categorised under estramustine (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), the median overall survival averaged 11.9 months (range 5.0 to 23.5) and was not significantly different from the respective comparative arms (5.0 to 18 months), although the addition of estramustine to paclitaxel improved overall survival with marginal significance (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2004</LINK>). For the other drug categories of cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone, the average median overall survival times (months) were, respectively, 8.3, 8.3, 10.1, and 15.8, and were not significantly different from the comparative treatment group in any trial. A noticeable observation from the data was the median overall survival times reported for trials evaluating docetaxel in HRPC patients (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). When used as a single agent, the median survival time was reported as 14.7 months (<LINK REF="STD-Dahut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dahut 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>), and 28.9 months with the addition of thalidomide. This is considerably longer than for all the previously described drugs. In the three other randomised studies in the docetaxel group, the median overall survival for treatment arms receiving docetaxel averaged 18.2 months and was significantly longer than the combination of prednisone plus mitoxantrone, in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Petrylak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Petrylak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>); the latter combination was regarded until recently as the standard therapy for HRPC in the USA. In the study reported by Tannock et al (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>), only the three weekly docetaxel regime, and not the weekly regime, significantly improved survival. Based on the survival data from the randomised studies in this review, treatment regimes containing docetaxel appear to provide a significant survival advantage compared to other chemotherapeutic regimes. However, the absolute differences in median survival times were relatively small (&lt; 2.5 months), which from a patient's point of view, may be considered of marginal benefit.</P>
<P>The quality of the included studies varied considerably, with some studies having poor standards of reporting. Although all the early studies were randomised, the assessment of chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer was hampered by the use of poor response criteria. In the 1970s the National Prostate Cancer Project (NPCP) pioneered the development of objective response criteria based, in part on measurable lesions and included complete response, partial response, objectively stable and objective progression (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>). A number of the older randomised trials used the NPCP citeria and accordingly no patient had a complete response to any chemotherapeutic regime tested, and between 2% to 7% had partial regressions. The mean response for stable disease with trials evaluating estramustine was 27% (<LINK REF="STD-De-Kernion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Kernion 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loening-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1983</LINK>); for cyclophosphamide it was 41% (<LINK REF="STD-Chlebowski-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chlebowski 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herr-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Herr 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasimis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kasimis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loening-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Muss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>), and for a 5-fluorouracil it was 48%. The majority of patients had objective progression with respective mean values of 68%, 52% and 52%. These data suggest that early chemotherapy regimes for patients with HRPC were ineffective in terms of tumour response. However, the assessment of objective response in advanced prostate cancer is a major subject for debate, and the early studies have been criticised for a number of reasons. Osteoblastic lesions are often the only manifestation of disseminated disease and accurately assessing response to chemotherapy using these lesion is difficult. In many of the studies, a significant proportion of patients had measurable disease for purposes of assessment, which suggests that they had very advanced or atypical disease and were, therefore, unlikely to experience a significant response to chemotherapy. In addition, the inclusion of stable disease as a category of response is controversial, as it could be a phase in the natural history of the disease itself, rather than being the effect of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Beedassy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beedassy 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, tumour markers, such alkaline phosphatase, and acid phosphatase were included in assessment criteria (<LINK REF="STD-De-Kernion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Kernion 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loening-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Saxman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1983</LINK>), which are, by contemporary standards, considered unreliable.</P>
<P>Most of the more recent studies included PSA in the assessment of response to chemotherapy (see Tables 1to 6), and, although some agents such as suramin and retinoic acid may directly modulate expression of PSA (<LINK REF="REF-Petrylak--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrylak 1999</LINK>), it is considered to be the most reliable marker available for prostate cancer. Although the exact magnitude of the PSA decline that constitutes a clinical benefit is controversial, a commonly expressed variable of response is the proportion of patients achieving a &gt; 50% reduction in PSA from baseline for at least two consecutive measurements over a 4-week period. For the randomised trials that reported the percentage of patients with a &gt; 50% decline in PSA, the mean values for regimes containing estramustine, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and docetaxel were, respectively, 48%, 20%, 50% (one study only), 33% and 52%. Estramustine, mitoxantrone and docetaxel all appear to give similarly high PSA responses; however, the comparisons are not definitive as a variable number of other agents were combined with each drug. The clinical value of PSA as a surrogate marker for all outcomes is not clear. In one trial, a decrease in PSA one month after chemotherapy with estramustine correlated significantly with cancer-specific survival (<LINK REF="STD-Iversen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Iversen 1997</LINK>), whereas one study reported that PSA correlated poorly with clinical response, with some patients exhibiting a rise in PSA and a good response whilst others had a falling PSA but a worsening of pain and performance status (<LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>). However, in overall terms, the percentage of patients with a &gt; 50% fall in PSA for all the trials combined and all interventions, correlated significantly with the corresponding median overall survival data (Spearman's rank correlation 0.735, P = 0.01), suggesting that the greater the proportion of patients with a PSA response the longer the median overall survival.</P>
<P>Over 80% of the patients included in this review presented with osseous metastases. The most distressing complication associated with bone involvement is pain, which may manifest as tonic background pain which is a deep non-specific ache increasing in intensity as the disease progresses, incident pain on movement (allodynia) which renders the patients virtually immobile , and spontaneous pain which may be severe (<LINK REF="REF-Urch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urch 2004</LINK>). Thirteen of the included trials reported that 25% to 100% of patients had bone pain on study entry (mean 81% <U>+</U> 21%), whereas one trial recruited asymptomatic men (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>). The effectiveness of chemotherapy on pain relief was poorly reported, with 17 studies not assessing pain response, and in 15 studies, pain relief was incorporated into the response definition and was not discernible as a distinct parameter. A number of drugs, either as single agents or in combination, were shown to be effective in reducing pain, with 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>), estramustine plus etoposide (<LINK REF="STD-Dimopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimopoulos 2004</LINK>), estramustine and epirubicin as single agents (<LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1991</LINK>) inducing pain relief in 62% to 76% of patients. Other regimes, such as single agents hydroxyurea, methly-CCNU, and cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Loening-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1981</LINK>), methotrexate and cisplatin (<LINK REF="STD-Loening-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Loening 1983</LINK>), estramustine plus prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), prednisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), the combination of docetaxel plus estramustine plus prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Oudard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oudard 2005</LINK>), and estramustine alone (<LINK REF="STD-Soloway-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 1981</LINK>), induced pain relief in 22% to 40% of patients. However, it is difficult to make comparisons between agents, because of the variation in pain definitions, type of patients recruited, time of assessment, and study designs. In one study , where pain assessment was the primary outcome of interest, mitoxantrone plus prednisone was significantly better than prednisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, in a subsequent study, docetaxel plus prednisone (three weekly) was found to induce significantly more pain relief than mitoxantrone plus prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Myelosuppression was a major toxicity induced by most of the chemotherapeutic agents assessed in this review. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported in 8% to 35% of patients receiving estramustine (<LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dimopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimopoulos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hudes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hudes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galsky 2005</LINK>), 8% to 20% for cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Chlebowski-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chlebowski 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Saxman 1992</LINK>; 0% to 32% for 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>), 6% to 57% for doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Francini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Francini 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torti-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Torti 1985</LINK>), 6% to 70% for mitoxantrone (<LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>), and 2% to 32% for docetaxel (<LINK REF="STD-Petrylak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Petrylak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>). Significant gastrointestinal toxicity was also reported in the majority of trials with nausea and vomiting experienced by 8% to 75% of patients receiving estramustine, 46% to 75% with cyclophosphamide, 2% to 9% with doxorubicin, and 0% to 60% for docetaxel. For mitoxantrone, nausea and vomiting were seen in 5% to 38% of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>), and was reported to be tolerable in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kantoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kantoff 1999</LINK>), and severe after 5 cycles in another (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>). There were no data extractable from trials containing 5-fluorouracil regimes; although Smalley et al (<LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>) reported that vomiting occurred for several hours after each dose. Mucositis was particularly noticeable with 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin containing regimes (<LINK REF="STD-Daliani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daliani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Droz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rangel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rangel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2001</LINK>). Cardiotoxicity was reported for all agents in 10% to 14% of patients, except for 5-fluorouracil whereas neurotoxicity was only observed with estramustine (10% to 73%), 5-fluorouracil (11% to 80%) and docetaxel (24% to 48%). Alopecia was also extensively seen, with up to 100% of patients developing this toxicity with cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Chlebowski-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chlebowski 1978</LINK>) and 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Smalley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Smalley 1981</LINK>). Treatment was stopped due to unacceptable toxicity in 10% to 40% receiving estramustine (<LINK REF="STD-Newling-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Newling 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akaza-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Akaza 1988</LINK>), 17% for doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Francini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Francini 1993</LINK>), 3% for mitoxantrone (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>) and 4% to 11% for docetaxel (<LINK REF="STD-Oudard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oudard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petrylak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Petrylak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>). In addition, the number of treatment related deaths for each agent group were 4% to 7% for estramustine (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akaza-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Akaza 1988</LINK>), 3% for cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Kasimis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kasimis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Saxman 1992</LINK>), 1% to 8% for 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Breul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Breul 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daliani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daliani 1995</LINK>), 0.7% to 1% for doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Leaf-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millikan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Millikan 2001</LINK>), and 0.3% for docetaxel (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>). The evidence from these trials indicates that chemotherapy is associated with substantial toxicity and that it places great demand on men with HRPC, who are often elderly. It is, therefore, essential that patients make a well-informed decision to undergo chemotherapy, making a balanced judgement on the risks and benefits of this treatment.</P>
<P>HRPC patients are generally elderly men with co-morbid conditions and many will have received several previous stressful clinical procedures and treatments. Chemotherapy, as an additional avenue of therapy, with its accompanying side effects, may be a daunting prospect for these men. Quality of life assessment is, therefore, of great importance when chemotherapy is to be considered for this population. It is surprising that only four randomised trials, out of the 47 included in this review, were designed to assess quality of life during chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abratt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Abratt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>). Tannock and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 1996</LINK>) used the Prostate Cancer Specific Quality of Life Instrument and two EORTC assessment protocols and reported an improvement with mitoxantrone/prednisone compared to prednisone alone. This was significant for overall well being. In a separate study, the same author (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>) reported a significant improvement in quality of life (FACT-P questionnaire) with docetaxel plus prednisone compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone, despite the increased toxicity of the docetaxel regime.</P>
<P>Finally, this review concentrated on assessing the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy for HRPC patients rather than hormone naive patients or those with hormone sensitive disease. It is, therefore, important that the included studies clearly defined the patient populations recruited for chemotherapy. There is no universally accepted definition of HRPC, but the general description of progressive disease despite hormonal therapy, was widely adopted. Another important consideration is that chemotherapy should not be initiated too soon following hormone therapy, because a clinical response due to anti-androgen withdrawal would confound the evaluation of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1997</LINK>). Thirty percent of studies stated that chemotherapy was started between 4 to 6 weeks following discontinuation of hormone therapy. Better reporting of patient characteristics and trial design would improve trial quality, and aid comparisons between studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Ideally a chemotherapeutic regime for patients with HRPC should be efficacious, improve survival, palliate symptoms, be non-toxic and improve quality of life compared to best standard of care. None of the regimes described in this review fulfilled all these criteria. However, the study by Tannock et al (<LINK REF="STD-Tannock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tannock 2004</LINK>) using a three weekly regime of docetaxel plus continuous prednisone provides encouraging results compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone (FDA approved as the palliative treatment of choice for HRPC). It was a very large, randomised study and the three weekly docetaxel regime significantly improved survival, pain relief and quality of life. At the present time this probably represents the best chemotherapeutic regime available for men with HRPC. The increase in survival with this regime is important because it confirms that HRPC is chemosensitive and that this regime may induce a change in the natural history of this disease. These data will motivate further studies to develop improved chemotherapeutic regimes for men with HRPC.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Men with symptomatic HRPC are a difficult group of patients for the clinician to treat and are not always candidates for chemotherapy. However, the improvement in chemotherapy over the last decade should continue to provide a viable option for the management of this disease. However, the clinical benefits of chemotherapy can only be tested against patients without such treatment in a randomised trial, and should be further evaluated against best standards of palliative care, involving radiotherapy, bisphosphonates and radioisotopes. Better reporting of trial data should be emphasised in new studies, such as more precise patient characteristics, including the type of pain experienced. Quality of life assessment should be an essential component in any studies of chemotherapy in HRPC. In addition more studies in less advanced prostate cancer, either as first line for newly diagnosed disease, or concurrent with hormone therapy, should be encouraged. </P>
<P>It is unclear how long chemotherapy, if initiated, should continue, and additional studies should be designed to address this issue. In the absence of any definitive data, it seems reasonable to continue until disease progression occurs or side effects determine treatment cessation. In addition, new studies should determine if second-line chemotherapy with perhaps estramustine plus docetaxel, has any benefit in patients relapsing from docetaxel plus prednisone.</P>
<P>Active research should continue to evaluate new agents in men with HRPC. In the present review, thalidomide although problematic with thromboembolic events, produced impressive median overall survival results. Bisphosphonate have reported synergistic activity with docetaxel and should be explored in phase III studies (<LINK REF="REF-Vordos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vordos 2004</LINK>). The epothilones, which are a new class of microtubule inhibitors, warrant clinical evaluation in randomised trials, following a study demonstrating a significant PSA response in up to 92% of patients with HRPC. In addition, chemotherapy in combination with other active biological agents such as suramin, cell-cycle inhibitors and immune therapy may lead to encouraging approaches. It is also important to continue basic research to unravel the molecular and genetic complexities of HRPC to direct future targeted chemotherapy.</P>
