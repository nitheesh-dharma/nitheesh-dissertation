<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-12 07:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even short-term postponement of birth when labour begins early (before 37 weeks) can help improve outcomes for babies, as the woman can take corticosteroid drugs to help develop the baby's lungs in a short time. Magnesium sulphate is one of the drugs that has been used to try to stop the uterus contracting in women who go into labour too soon.</P>
<P>This review of 37 trials including 3571 women and their infants did not find that magnesium sulphate, given to women who go into labour too soon, prevented babies being born too soon or reduced the risks of the baby developing serious health problems. However, antenatal magnesium sulphate is effective in helping women who develop pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and for helping to protect babies' brains.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-07 15:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>The 37 included trials (total of 3571 women and over 3600 babies) were generally of moderate to high risk of bias. Antenatal magnesium sulphate was compared with either placebo, no treatment, or a range of alternative tocolytic agents.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of giving birth within 48 hours after trial entry, no significant differences were seen between women who received magnesium sulphate and women who did not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, or human chorionic gonadotropin) (19 trials, 1913 women). Similarly for the primary outcome of serious infant outcome, there were no significant differences between the infants exposed to magnesium sulphate and those not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin or various tocolytic drugs) (18 trials; 2187 babies). No trials reported the outcome of extremely preterm birth. In the seven trials that reported serious maternal outcomes, no events were recorded.</P>
<P>In the group treated with magnesium sulphate compared with women receiving antenatal placebo or no alternative tocolytic drug, a borderline increased risk of total death (fetal, neonatal, infant) was seen (risk ratio (RR) 4.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 20.86; two trials, 257 babies); none of the comparisons between magnesium sulphate and other classes of tocolytic drugs showed differences for this outcome (10 trials, 991 babies). The outcomes of neonatal and/or infant deaths and of fetal deaths did not show differences between magnesium sulphate and no magnesium sulphate, whether compared with placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, or any specific class of tocolytic drug. For most of the other secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between magnesium sulphate and the control groups for risk of preterm birth (except for a significantly lower risk with magnesium sulphate when compared with barbiturates in one trial of 65 women), gestational age at birth, interval between trial entry and birth, other neonatal morbidities, or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Duration of neonatal intensive care unit stay was significantly increased in the magnesium sulphate group compared with the calcium channel blocker group, but not when compared with cox inhibitors or prostaglandin inhibitors. No maternal deaths were reported in the four trials reporting this outcome. Significant differences between magnesium sulphate and controls were not seen for maternal adverse events severe enough to stop treatment, except for a significant benefit of magnesium sulphate compared with betamimetics in a single trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-11 11:17:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Magnesium sulphate is ineffective at delaying birth or preventing preterm birth, has no apparent advantages for a range of neonatal and maternal outcomes as a tocolytic agent and its use for this indication may be associated with an increased risk of total fetal, neonatal or infant mortality (in contrast to its use in appropriate groups of women for maternal, fetal, neonatal and infant neuroprotection where beneficial effects have been demonstrated).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-12 10:47:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth remains the principal cause of early neonatal death (<LINK REF="REF-March-of-Dimes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">March of Dimes 2012</LINK>). Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) often suffer significant immediate morbidity and need lengthy stays in neonatal intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-Claas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claas 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darlow 2009</LINK>). Moreover, there is a significant risk of long-term neurological morbidity in a proportion of the survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Kugelman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kugelman 2012</LINK>). The more preterm the baby the greater are the risks, especially when birth occurs before 32 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2012</LINK>). Parents are understandably worried and distressed when their baby is born preterm. Parents, health professionals and society share the burden of responsibility and costs, both personal and monetary, for preterm birth and its sequelae. The prevention of preterm birth therefore remains an important priority.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-12 10:48:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tocolytic agents inhibit uterine contractions, and a variety have been used to inhibit uterine activity in women in preterm labour and so attempt to prevent preterm birth. Agents used include betamimetics, prostaglandin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, ethanol, oxytocin receptor antagonists and magnesium sulphate. The ideal tocolytic agent should be easy to administer, inexpensive, without significant maternal, fetal or neonatal side effects, and effective at delaying preterm birth, at least long enough to permit the use of antenatal corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is considerable variation in the type of tocolytic agent used in different parts of the world. Magnesium sulphate has been widely used as a tocolytic in the United States of America (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2006</LINK>), although there have been reports of an increase in infant mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>) and admission to neonatal intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2011</LINK>) with a suggestion that there is a dose-response relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>). In 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration advised against the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate for more than five to seven days when used to try to stop preterm labour, due to concerns about fetal and neonatal bone development; this led to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issuing a committee opinion supporting short-term but not long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Magnesium sulphate was described as having an effect on uterine contractility by increasing the duration of labour in the late 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1959</LINK>). The exact mechanism of magnesium sulphate as a tocolytic agent is only partially understood. Magnesium decreases the frequency of depolarisation of smooth muscle, by modulating calcium uptake, binding and distribution in smooth muscle cells. The net result is inhibition of uterine contractions. Magnesium sulphate is essential for cellular health including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis and plasma membrane integrity (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mildvan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mildvan 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Magnesium sulphate, by its peripheral vasodilator effects when infused intravenously, produces flushing, sweating, and a sensation of warmth. Reported maternal side effects relate to dosage and speed of infusion and include nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations and rarely, pulmonary oedema. Administration to concentrations above the recommended therapeutic range can lead to respiratory depression, respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest (<LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 2009</LINK>). For the neonate, hypermagnesaemia can lead to hyporeflexia, poor sucking, and, rarely, respiratory depression needing mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1971</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The previous version of this review concluded that magnesium sulphate was ineffective at delaying birth or preventing preterm birth and that its use was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality. Despite this evidence, using magnesium sulphate for tocolysis has remained a common practice in the USA in particular (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2006</LINK>). It is therefore important to integrate evidence that has become available since the last update in order to see the impact on the review's previous conclusions.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study we described the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from which intervention a participant received. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>

<P>For each included study we described the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusions where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; 'as treated' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and described what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see</I> <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS">Sensitivity analysis</A>.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-02-12 07:18:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous data we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data we calculated the mean difference (MDs) between treatment groups where outcomes were measured in the same way. Standardised mean differences would have been used if the outcomes from trials were the same but different methods had been used to collect the data. We reported 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-02-12 14:06:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were no major unit of analysis issues. Several trials had unit of analysis issues with reporting of interventions used or multiple births, which meant that not all of the outcome data could be included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Parilla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Parilla 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pezzati-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pezzati 2001</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-02-12 14:06:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Levels of attrition were noted. For all of the outcomes, we carried out analyses using an intention-to-treat basis, where possible. All participants were analysed, where possible in the treatment group to which they were randomised, regardless of the actual treatment received. The denominator for each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:27:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary. This was done by assessing statistical heterogeneity using the Tau, Chi and I statistics. An I measurement greater than 30% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and either a Tau greater than zero, or a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. Where substantial heterogeneity was detected, we explored possible explanations in sensitivity/subgroup analyses. Statistical heterogeneity was taken into account when interpreting the results, especially where there was any variation in the direction of effect.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:27:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Some types of reporting bias (e.g. publication bias, multiple publication bias, language bias etc) reduce the likelihood that all studies eligible for a review will be retrieved. If all eligible studies are not retrieved, the review may be biased. We conducted a comprehensive search for eligible studies and were alert for duplication of data. When there were 10 or more studies in analyses, we used funnel plots to explore the possibility of small study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies).</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:27:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>Where we used random-effects analysis, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and estimates of I.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-08-08 11:04:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>We planned subgroup analyses to examine separately the primary outcomes, and fetal, neonatal and infant mortality, for women exposed to magnesium sulphate compared with no treatment or placebo and women given magnesium sulphate compared with type of alternative tocolytic therapy (such as betamimetics, prostaglandin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, nitric oxide donors and sedatives).</P>
<P>Further analyses were planned to assess the primary outcomes, and fetal, neonatal and infant mortality, by dose of magnesium sulphate used. This was achieved by comparing trials with a magnesium maintenance protocol that recommended magnesium sulphate infusion rates of up to 2 g/hour with trials with a magnesium maintenance protocol of more than 2 g/hour.</P>

<P>Fourteen trials that included 1134 women reported on maternal adverse effects sufficient to discontinue treatment. No significant differences were seen for any of the comparisons of magnesium sulphate, except for magnesium sulphate compared with betamimetics, which favoured magnesium sulphate (average RR 0.14 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75, five trials, 398 women). Significant heterogeneity was noted for the comparison of magnesium sulphate with no other tocolytic drugs and so a random-effects model was used (average RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 221.68, four trials, 302 women, I = 85%) - <LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK> (total deaths), there is some suggestion of asymmetry (missing small trials showing more deaths in the magnesium sulphate groups) which may be due to under-reporting of fetal deaths. There is similar asymmetry evident for <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK> (respiratory distress syndrome) and <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK> (IVH) but none of these three instances of asymmetry are likely to be sufficient to reverse the findings of no significant differences between magnesium sulphate and control groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK> (maternal adverse effects severe enough for discontinuation) does not show a symmetrical funnel plot, perhaps due to differential influences of different tocolytic agents.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-12 07:47:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that magnesium sulphate has been widely used as a tocolytic for many years, it remains surprising that the evidence to support its use is generally unclear or with moderate to high risk of bias.</P>
<P>From the available data, there was no convincing evidence of a clinically important tocolytic effect for magnesium sulphate; it did not have any substantial effect on the proportion of women delivering within 48 hours, either overall, or in any of the subgroup analyses. A higher dose did not make any difference to the outcome. Moreover, there was no evidence of any substantial improvement in neonatal morbidity. Indeed, magnesium sulphate may be associated with a borderline increase in paediatric deaths, although this result was not seen for overall fetal, neonatal and/or infant mortality or when trials with a higher risk of bias were omitted in a sensitivity analysis. Babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were not more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care, but if admitted they were more likely to stay longer than those babies not exposed to magnesium sulphate.</P>
<P>There was little evidence of either major benefit or harm to the mother from giving magnesium sulphate. Cessation of treatment due to maternal adverse events was not significantly different between the magnesium sulphate and control groups.</P>
<P>In many comparisons there was considerable heterogeneity. Some of this may have been caused by the different drugs used in the comparison groups, ranging from betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, prostaglandin inhibitors, to nitric oxide donors. However, even in some analyses restricted to subgroups of similar tocolytics, residual heterogeneity of unknown origin remained.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-10 05:38:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some funnel plot asymmetry suggests that several small negative trials may be missing although this is unlikely to have affected the overall findings of no significant differences between magnesium sulphate and control groups. If such trials exist, they may be unpublished as a comprehensive search was done for this review.</P>
<P>No long-term outcomes were reported in any trial except for cerebral palsy in a single trial.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-12 11:08:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the 37 included trials, adequate allocation concealment was reported in only six trials, mainly by the use of sealed envelopes. Four trials were quasi-randomised. In the majority of trials magnesium sulphate was compared with other drugs with reputed tocolytic activity, which made blinding of women and investigators infeasible or very difficult. Only one trial made mention of blinding outcome assessors; and two-thirds of trials were judged to be at some risk of selective outcome reporting bias. About one-third of trials showed baseline imbalance in numbers randomised, probably reflecting the less than adequate randomisation in most trials. No trials were rated as being at low risk of bias on all accepted criteria.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-10 04:10:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selective outcome reporting bias is likely to have been an influence in this review. Expected maternal and infant outcomes were often not reported in standard ways, such that we could not pool data for these outcomes. In particular, failure to report fetal deaths (or absence thereof) contributes to difficulty in interpreting the perinatal and infant death data. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:30:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The conclusions of this updated review have altered from previous versions by diluting the evidence for increased neonatal mortality when magnesium is used as a tocolytic, although findings for the primary outcomes do not differ between versions. Our findings are consistent with a recent network meta-analysis of tocolytic therapy where prostaglandin inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (but not magnesium sulphate) showed the highest chance of delaying birth and improving neonatal and maternal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>). The current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology Practice Bulletin on 'Management of preterm labour' supports betamimetics, calcium channel blockers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for short-term treatment (up to 48 hours) as first-line therapy to allow antenatal corticosteroids to be administered (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to distinguish the evidence for magnesium sulphate used as a tocolytic from its use in pregnancy as an anticonvulsant (for preventing eclampsia - <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010</LINK>) or use prior to very preterm birth for neuroprotection of the fetus and infant (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2009</LINK>), where short-term use of antenatal magnesium sulphate has been shown to be effective and safe.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-12 07:16:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence does not support the use of magnesium sulphate as an appropriate tocolytic agent to use for women in preterm labour. It is ineffective in delaying preterm birth and may be associated with a increased risk of death for the neonate (in contrast to beneficial effects of magnesium sulphate for maternal, fetal and infant neuroprotection in appropriate groups of women). Babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were not more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care, but if admitted they were more likely to stay longer than those babies not exposed to magnesium sulphate.</P>

<P>In this update, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of excluding cross-over trials where another tocolytic was used in case of tocolytic failure with magnesium.</P>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of tocolysis for inhibiting preterm labour have been prespecified following consultation with the editors and authors of the individual reviews. Consensus was reached on six &#8216;core&#8217; outcomes. These have now been highlighted in the methods section of the review, August 2014.</P>
