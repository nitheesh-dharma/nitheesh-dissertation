<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-13 12:57:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane review authors investigated whether transferring an embryo on Day two or on Day three of development makes a difference to pregnancy outcomes in women having in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Embryo transfer has usually been performed two days after oocyte (egg) retrieval; however, developments in culture media and embryo culture methods have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. This means that more assessments can be undertaken to look at the implantation chances for each embryo. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>We identified 15 randomised trials meeting the review inclusion criteria. These include 14 trials reporting data from 2894 women; one trial reported data from 969 cycles so could not be included in meta-analysis. All of the included studies were parallel-design randomised controlled trials conducted in Brazil, Chile, Singapore, Argentina, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Israel, Canada, Greece, Japan, Italy, Norway and Belgium. The evidence is current to April 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Only three of 15 studies reported on live birth as an outcome. We found that there was no clear evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. There were no data reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was poorly reported in the included studies and blinding was not possible (although we feel this is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from <I>moderate </I>to <I>very low.</I> The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods (risk of bias), lack of agreement between studies (inconsistency), low event rates and lack of accuracy (imprecision) for some outcomes and poor reporting of live birth outcomes (selective reporting).</P>
<P>Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we do not plan to update this review again. Many of the trials included in this review have used outdated techniques that include stimulation, laboratory technology and transferring more than one embryo. We would direct the reader to the <A HREF="Glujovsky 2016">Glujovsky 2016</A> Cochrane review comparing Day 2/3 with day 5/6 embryo transfer.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:08:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Embryo transfer (ET) was traditionally performed two days after oocyte retrieval; however, developments in culture media have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:12:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To determine if there are any differences in live birth and pregnancy rates when embryo transfer is performed on day three after oocyte retrieval, compared with day two, in infertile couples undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-14 11:44:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) from the inception of the databases to 26th April 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal for ongoing trials plus citation lists of relevant publications, review articles and included studies, as well as abstracts of appropriate scientific meetings.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:14:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-14 14:56:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We included 15 studies. Fourteen studies reported data per woman (2894 women) and one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles). The quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach ranged from <I>moderate quality </I>to <I>very low quality. </I>The main reasons for downgrading evidence were poor methodological reporting, selective reporting, inconsistency and imprecision.</P>
<P>
<I>Live birth per woman -</I> Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between Day three and Day two embryo transfer (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.23; three studies, n = 1200 women; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%; <I>very low quality evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 32% of women who underwent a Day two embryo transfer had a live birth, then between 28% to 39% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a live birth.</P>
<P>
<I>Ongoing pregnancy per woman</I> - There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; six studies, n = 1740 women; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%; <I>very low quality of evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 33% of women undergoing a Day two embryo transfer had an ongoing pregnancy then between 28% to 37% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have an ongoing pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical pregnancy per woman - </I>There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the chance of a clinical pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 12 studies, n = 2461, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%; <I>very low quality evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 39% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a clinical pregnancy, then between 38% to 46% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a clinical pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple pregnancy per woman - </I>There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; eight studies, n = 1837; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 11% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a multiple pregnancy, then between 9% to 15% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a multiple pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>Miscarriage rate per woman - </I>There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60; nine studies, n = 2153 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 26%; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 6% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a miscarriage, then between 5% to 10% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a miscarriage.</P>
<P>
<I>Ectopic pregnancy rate per woman - </I>There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.40; six studies, n = 1531 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <I>low quality evidence</I>). The data suggest that if 0.7% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer have an ectopic pregnancy, then between 0.2% to 2% of women undergoing Day three embryo transfer would have an ectopic pregnancy.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis for pregnancy outcomes did not identify any differential effect between IVF and ICSI.</P>
<P>None of the included studies prespecified complication rate (e.g. OHSS), fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure as outcomes in their studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:25:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Twelve of 15 studies contributed data that could be included in meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence ranged from <I>moderate </I>to <I>very low. </I>Only three of the 15 studies reported data for live birth, although the data for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are consistent with the live birth data, suggesting no difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference identified between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy per woman randomised. No data were reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or woman's evaluation of the procedure. The current evidence has not identified any evidence of differences in pregnancy outcomes between Day two and Day three embryo transfers. Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-11 23:00:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:34:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Infertility may be caused by male or female factors, or both, but in some couples no cause can be found (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2002</LINK>). In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is considered beneficial for most couples who are unlikely to conceive without treatment, and for whom less invasive forms of treatment have failed or are unlikely to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:36:13 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>IVF involves the use of hormones to stimulate the ovaries to produce many eggs (oocytes), followed by egg collection (oocyte retrieval), mixing of eggs and sperm, fertilisation, embryo culture and, lastly, the return of a selected embryo to the uterus (embryo transfer, ET). The aim of this review is to determine whether the number of days between oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer (i.e. the number of days the embryos are grown in vitro) has any effect on the success of IVF treatment, in particular, the live birth rate - the most important outcome for the couple (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The question of optimal timing for embryo transfer arises when examining the differences between the IVF procedures and what happens naturally in vivo. Embryo transfer was performed traditionally two days after oocyte retrieval, when the embryos are at the cleavage stage (<LINK REF="REF-Coskun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coskun 2002</LINK>), because it is thought the uterus provides the best environment for the survival of the embryo (<LINK REF="STD-Laverge-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laverge 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-11 23:00:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Early replacement in the uterine cavity may be advantageous for the embryo, by limiting the time spent in the in vitro environment of incubators in an embryology laboratory. Developments in culture media have enabled embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacic-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacic 2002</LINK>), allowing for further development of the embryo in vitro. It has been suggested that the longer time in culture improves the accuracy of selection of the best quality embryos for transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Huisman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisman 2000</LINK>), because additional morphological features are available for assessment at this time (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, there remains a concern that extended culture of embryos may increase the risk of congenital abnormalities and pre-term births (<LINK REF="REF-Dar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_ll_x00e9_n-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Källén 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalra-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalra 2012</LINK>). When considering the best time for selecting and transferring early cleavage embryos, delaying transfer an extra day from Day two to Day three may increase the likelihood of successful implantation and also improve endometrial differentiation (<LINK REF="REF-Nikas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikas 2000</LINK>), taking a step closer to the natural situation in which the embryo arrives in the uterus four to five days after ovulation. In addition, the selection and deselection of embryos on Day three can be further improved using appropriate algorithms in conjunction with time-lapse videography (<LINK REF="REF-Conaghan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conaghan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The question of whether blastocyst stage embryos (Day 5/6) should be transferred compared to embryos at the cleavage stage (Day 2/3) is the subject of another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Glujovsky-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glujovsky 2016</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-09 00:39:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Assessing the development potential of embryos is an important determinant of its ability to implant after it has been transferred into the uterus. The improvement in culture media and in embryo culture methods has permitted embryos to be grown for longer periods of time, thereby enabling an assessment of their implantation potential. Consequently, the traditional approach of transferring embryos on Day two should be compared with that of Day three, whereby embryos that demonstrate optimal growth during the extra day of monitoring in culture can be preferentially selected.</P>

<P>For the 2016 update of this review, after an initial screen of the titles and abstracts retrieved in the searches (by JB), we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (JB, SD) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the review. We corresponded with study investigators, as required, to confirm study eligibility. We resolved disagreements on study eligibility by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-12-11 23:07:59 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>In earlier versions of this review CO and JG independently performed all assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction, using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines, and resolving any discrepancies by consensus. In the 2016 update JB performed an initial screen for included studies. We sought additional information on trial methodology or original trial data or both from the authors of trials that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but had aspects of methodology that were unclear or data that were in a form unsuitable for meta-analysis. We present details of each trial in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-12 15:28:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risks of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess: selection (random selection and allocation concealment), performance (blinding of participants and personnel), detection (blinding of outcome assessors), attrition (incomplete outcome data), reporting (selective reporting), and other biases. We resolved disagreements by discussion or when necessary by recourse to a third author. We have described all aspects of risk of bias in detail in the 'Risk of bias' tables (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For the purpose of this review we decided that in studies in which there was no evidence of blinding we would judge the risk of bias to be unclear, because it is not likely that blinding of participants would influence pregnancy outcomes. We made attempts to identify trial protocols and compare them to published papers. For studies that had not reported live birth but had reported other interim pregnancy outcomes, we undertook an informal assessment to determine if the interim data were similar to the data reported for live birth.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-12-09 01:00:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We have only reported on dichotomous data (e.g. live birth per woman randomised). We used the number of events in the control and intervention groups to calculate Mantel-Haenzel risk ratios (RRs); these data are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-12-09 01:01:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The primary unit of analysis was per woman randomised. Data reporting outcomes per cycle were not included in the meta-analysis. We have counted multiple births as one birth event. We have not included cross-over trials in the current version of this review.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-12 15:25:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We have considered whether clinical and methodological characteristics of the included trials are sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary. We assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, taking a measurement &gt; 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-12 15:29:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We attempted to minimise the risk of reporting biases by conducting a thorough and systematic search of the literature for published and unpublished literature without any restrictions by language. For 10 or more trials reporting an outcome, we explored reporting bias by visual examination of a funnel plot.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall quality of the body of evidence: 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We have prepared a <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> using <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK> software. This table evaluates the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage) using GRADE criteria (study limitations, consistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias). Judgements about quality (high, moderate, low or very low) are justified and incorporated into the results for each outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Periodic updates to the review </B>
<BR/>Although the optimal information size to test the hypothesis of no difference between Day two and Day three transfers has not yet been reached, we believe that any new studies are unlikely to change the findings of this review, and therefore consider the review to be stable. No further updates are planned.</P>

<P>In the previous version of this review there were 10 included studies, 18 excluded studies and one study awaiting classification.</P>
<P>In 2016 the search for the update identified 749 potential studies after duplicates had been removed. We included five new studies and added one to the <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> category. We excluded one study. See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for flow diagram of study selection.</P>
<P>In the 2016 update of this review we have included 15 studies (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>); we excluded 19 studies (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Two studies are awaiting assessment (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Amireh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amireh 1998</LINK>, the inclusion criteria were met, because it was described as a randomised trial, but it was also described as a retrospective assessment. Furthermore, all the required data were not provided in the abstract. We have contacted the authors for additional information about the randomisation process and the numbers of women in each group. The second study awaiting classification is <LINK REF="STD-Shahine-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shahine 2011</LINK>. This study appears to be a randomised trial comparing Day two versus Day three embryo transfer in 251 women classified as poor responders undergoing IVF. The data in the table for clinical pregnancy and miscarriage do not tally, and we plan to contact the authors to provide information on the methods of randomisation and the correct numbers for these outcomes.</P>

<P>
<B>Participants </B>
<BR/>Two thousand eight hundred and ninety four women took part in the included trials; one study (<LINK REF="STD-De-los-Santos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De los Santos 2003</LINK>) only reported on the number of cycles (969 cycles with 888 embryo transfers) and not the number of women. We have not included the data from this study in any meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Six hundred and ninety-eight women underwent IVF and 1601 women underwent ICSI. In four of the studies added in 2016 it was unclear how many women had undergone IVF or ICSI (<LINK REF="STD-De-los-Santos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De los Santos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsella-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsella 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pantos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pantos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The age of participants was available for 11 studies. The mean female age ranged from 31 to 37 years and was comparable in the two study groups of each trial. Information about age was not provided in <LINK REF="STD-De-los-Santos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De los Santos 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DiBeradino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiBeradino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsella-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsella 2005</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Nordstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nordstrom 1995</LINK>. A maximum age limit was not stated in any trial.</P>

<P>
<B>Interventions </B>
<BR/>All studies compared the intervention of embryo transfer on Day three versus Day two. Details of the ovarian stimulation protocol, embryo culture methods, and embryo transfer procedure were noted, when available. In all trials that described the protocols and procedures used, they were similar for the two treatment groups. All trials used fresh embryos.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>Live birth was reported in three of 15 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ertzeid-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ertzeid 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverge-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laverge 2001</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-09 23:50:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We found no evidence of differences in live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy when delaying embryo transfer from Day two to Day three. The evidence is based on data from 15 studies, of which 14 reported data per woman (2894 women) and were analysed, while one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles) and was not included. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) .</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-09 23:55:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The data for most pregnancy outcomes were similar enough to make meaningful comparisons. The heterogeneity observed for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy could not be explained by the subgroup analysis examining the method of assisted reproductive technology used (IVF or ICSI). Live birth outcomes were poorly reported, with only three of 15 included studies reporting this outcome. We calculated that to detect a clinically significant difference of five percentage points in live birth rate, using the control rate of 32% that was observed in the Day two group, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 90%, would require an optimal information size of 1900 participants per group (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2002</LINK>). The current meta-analysis for live birth includes three studies comprising 1200 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, the data for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates per woman randomised are consistent and show no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer.</P>
<P>Caution is required in interpreting some of the data, especially for ectopic pregnancy, because the reported event rates are low with wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, demonstrating imprecision. There is poor reporting for the number of cryopreserved embryos and the cumulative pregnancy rate.</P>
<P>All of the included trials transferred more than one embryo in the Day three and the Day two intervention groups. Of the eight trials reporting the outcome of multiple pregnancy, between two to four embryos were transferred per cycle. The evidence in this review is therefore not readily transferable to current practice in most fertility settings.</P>
<P>Although it was not a prespecified analysis, we identified that Day three embryo transfer was associated with a reduced clinical pregnancy rate compared with Day two embryo transfer in women who were poor responders. This may warrant further investigation.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-09 23:56:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The included studies could be compromised by the low level of methodological quality. Allocation concealment was poorly reported and blinding was not possible (although this criterion is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. Only three of 15 included studies reported live births. Using the GRADE approach, we judged that the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), with the main reasons for downgrading the evidence being unclear risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and publication bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-12 15:29:38 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We believe that we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic search of the literature. There have been no date or language restrictions and we have searched for unpublished as well as published evidence. The funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) indicates that there were three studies that appeared to be outliers (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelmassih-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelmassih 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bahceci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bahceci 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1999</LINK>). These studies all reported on embryo transfer following ICSI. Subgroup analysis looking at the method of assisted reproductive technology used did not identify any differential effect between ICSI and IVF.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-10 00:00:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We could not identify any other systematic reviews that have evaluated the comparison of Day three versus Day two embryo transfer.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-10 00:01:29 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate an increase in pregnancy success with Day three embryo transfer. Any further trials comparing these timings of embryo transfer (Day three versus Day two) are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated. Many of the trials included in this review have used outdated techniques that include stimulation, laboratory technology and number of embryos transferred. We would direct the reader to the <LINK REF="REF-Glujovsky-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glujovsky 2016</LINK> Cochrane Review comparing Day 2/3 with day 5/6 embryo transfer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-10 00:02:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To date, the cumulative data from the trials selected for review have not reached the optimal information size required to adequately test the null hypothesis. Given the estimates of the treatment effect observed in the selected trials, it is unlikely that the magnitude of the summary treatment effect observed (of no significant difference) will be altered by adding more trials to this review; only the precision of this estimate would be improved. We do not believe that any further trials comparing Day three with Day two embryo transfer would alter the results of this review. If further trials should be conducted they should examine the comparison between Day 2/3 transfer with Day five transfer in poor responders or in couples with poor embryo development. These future trials should report on live birth as a primary outcome. We suggest that there is no further need to continue updating this review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-12-10 00:09:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>In the 2016 update we removed the outcome 'Complication rate'. We also removed analyses that related to outcomes per embryo transfer rather than per woman randomised, because of the increased risk of bias from inaccurate units of analysis.</P>
<P>Due to the suggestion that Day three and Day two transfer may be relevant for specific groups of women undergoing fertility treatment, we included, where data were available, an analysis that had not been prespecified, reporting on ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy and multiple pregnancy in poor responders.</P>
<P>Also for the 2016 update, we analysed the data using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios.</P>
