<P>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD, also called diabetic nephropathy, DN) is the major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in many countries and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as compared to other causes of kidney disease. One of the pathological changes of DKD is the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion and proliferation. The presence of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, an important constituent of the glomerular basement membrane, is decreased in DKD proportionally to the increasing degree of proteinuria. Research on animals has suggested that heparin and related substances may prevent glomerular membrane thickening. However, it is not known whether heparin and related substances can prevent the onset of DKD and, therefore, be recommended for primary prevention of this condition.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-02 09:33:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD; also called diabetic nephropathy, DN) is one of the major microvascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). It is commonly assumed that type 1 and type 2 diabetics have the similar pathogenetic and clinical stages of kidney damage, as outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1997</LINK>. During the development of kidney disease, diabetic patients go through several characteristic stages, including renal hypertrophy and hyperfiltration, microalbuminuric (incipient) kidney disease (urine albumin excretion rate, UAER 30 to 300 mg/d), macroalbuminuric (overt) kidney disease (UAER &gt; 300 mg/d), and eventually reach end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) if they do not die because of cardiovascular complications which account for the majority of deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>DKD occurs in 30% to 40% of type 1 diabetic patients, 20 to 25 years after disease onset and in an increasing percentage (up to 25%) of type 2 patients after a variable number of years (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>). DKD is the major cause of ESKD in most western nations and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as compared to other causes of kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999b</LINK>). According to the most recent reports of the U.S. Renal Data System (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 1998</LINK>), there has been a continuous increase in the incidence of DKD, predominantly in those with type 2 diabetes. The population of existing patients whose ESKD is caused by diabetes, which tripled from 1990 to 2000, is expected to grow ten-fold by 2030, to 1.3 million. The proportion of patients with both ESKD and diabetes is now 55% (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>). DKD is particularly common among the elderly and non-Caucasian (i.e. Black, Asian, and Native American) populations. A similar trend has occurred in other developed countries as well, making ESKD in patients with diabetes a medical problem of worldwide dimensions (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The survival of patients with DKD drops to extremely low levels once ESKD occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Chantrel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chantrel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>). The five-year survival rates are 6% in Germany and 27% in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>) similar to the rates among patients with metastasising gastrointestinal carcinoma. Once ESKD is reached, patients enter the highest cardiovascular risk state known (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2004</LINK>). However, more people with DKD will die primarily of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than progress to ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, data from studies conducted in the USA show that the medical cost of ESKD was about USD 12.7 billion in 1999 and is expected to increase to USD 28 billion a year by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2001</LINK>). These factors justify intensive efforts to prevent and treat DKD.</P>
<P>Currently, DKD can be approached on three different levels. Primary prevention is achieved in patients without clinical and biochemical signs of kidney damage (UAER &lt; 30 mg/d), by strict glycaemic control using oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, as required, together with maintenance of blood pressure (BP) levels &lt; 130/85 mm Hg, preferably using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockade (ARB). Secondary prevention aims to prevent or delay the progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria. BP control is the first-line approach, along with strict glycaemic control. At this stage, the use of other antihypertensive agents in addition to ACEi or ARB may be necessary to achieve optimal BP levels (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>). Tertiary prevention addresses the reduction of the progression rate to ESKD by optimal BP control, a slightly hypoproteic (reduced protein) diet and the control of dyslipidaemia, in the presence of a (non-fundamental) euglycaemic state. However, the above mentioned measurements for preventing the onset and progression of DKD are only partially effective. Furthermore, strict metabolic control can be difficult. So the search for additional and alternative treatment options is needed.</P>
<P>One of the pathological changes of DKD is the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion and proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Pijl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Pijl 1997</LINK>). The presence of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, an important constituent of the glomerular basement membrane, is decreased in DKD proportionally to the increasing degree of proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Pijl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Pijl 1997</LINK>). In DKD, increased urinary excretion of albumin has been associated with progression of disease and a more serious prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>). Biochemical studies in kidneys of insulin dependent diabetic mellitus (IDDM) patients with end-stage DKD have shown a decreased content of proteoglycan molecules in glomerular basement membranes compared with nondiabetic subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Shinmomura-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinmomura 1987</LINK>). Moreover, several studies of experimental diabetes in animals describe abnormalities of synthesis, sulfation, content, and/or proteoglycan matrix interaction of heparan sulfate molecules in diabetic glomerular basement membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1989</LINK>). Supporting these observations, it has been shown that heparan can prevent albuminuria and thickening of glomerular basement membranes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (<LINK REF="REF-Gambaro-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gambaro 1992</LINK>); sulodexide can effectively lower the urinary albumin excretion rate, improve the ultrastructural renal pathologies and prevent glomerular basement membrane thickening in diabetic rats (<LINK REF="REF-Shu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shu 2009</LINK>). Parallel to these experimental studies, clinical studies have also demonstrated a few positive effects of heparin and related substances (heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), heparinoids, heparitin sulfate and sulodexide) on delaying the progression of DKD (<LINK REF="STD-Achour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Achour 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gambaro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gambaro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solini 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamsma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamsma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Pijl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Pijl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Pijl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Pijl 1999</LINK>). However, whether heparin and related substances can prevent the onset of DKD and be recommended for routine use for primary prevention in DM is still unknown.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 18:05:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Using the search strategy described, we obtained titles and abstracts of studies that may have been relevant to the review. These titles and abstracts were screened independently by two authors (Li J and Zhang L), who discarded studies that were clearly not applicable. However, studies and reviews that might have included relevant data or information on published or ongoing studies were retained initially. The same two authors independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, if necessary, the full text of these studies to determine which ones satisfied the inclusion criteria. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 17:26:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We planned for the same two authors to extract data, independently, using standard data extraction forms. Agreement between the two authors was to be tested using the statistic Kappa value. Where more than one publication of a study existed, we planned to group these reports together and include only the publication with the most complete data. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions, we planned to use these data. Disagreements were to be resolved in consultation with a third author (Wu HM)<B>.</B>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-07-26 16:51:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. all-cause mortality) results were to be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g. CrCl, SCr, quality of life measures), the mean difference (MD) was to be used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used.</P>

<P>We planned to use subgroup analysis to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, type of diabetes, stage of diabetes, baseline presence/absence of hypertension and renal pathology. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, dose and duration of therapy. Heterogeneity among studies could be related to study quality. Adverse effects were to be tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, as they were likely to be different for the various agents used. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI were to be calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 21:38:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Through computerised searches, 74 potentially relevant studies were found. After title and abstract screening, 61 studies were excluded because they included patients who already had DKD; and two studies were excluded because no heparin or related substances were observed.</P>
<P>Eleven potentially eligible studies were retrieved for further assessment. Through the full text screening, these eleven studies were excluded because of the following reasons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Patients who were observed in the studies already had DKD (five studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Achour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Achour 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piva-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Piva 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zalevskaia-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zalevskaia 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Patients were not randomised to the treatment and control groups (three studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Ceriello-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceriello 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markoski-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Markoski 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markovski-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Markovski 1977</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Patients without DM were included (one study) (<LINK REF="STD-Pisano-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pisano 1986</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>No data on the outcomes of interest were available (two studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Kalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalani 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scroggie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scroggie 2003</LINK>).</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 21:42:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>No studies met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Diabetes prevalence is increasing most rapidly in both the developed and developing countries. Despite substantial under diagnosis, worldwide, 171 million people have diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>). As the population of patients with diabetes of long duration grows, DKD becomes the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in developed countries, and is rapidly becoming the leading cause in developing countries as a consequence of the global increase in type 2 diabetes and obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmet 2001</LINK>). The data from US Renal Data System indicated DKD accounts for 45% of prevalent kidney failure, up from 18% in 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2004</LINK>). Management of DKD is costly not only in developed but also developing countries so a lot of focus has been put on the prevention and treatment of DKD. A growing body of evidence suggests that to reduce the risk or slow the progression of DKD, optimising glucose control and BP control are necessary. Reduction of protein intake in individuals with DKD may improve measures of kidney function and is recommended. There are clinical studies and guideline support that in the treatment of DKD, either ACEi or ARB should be used and can improve the prognosis of DKD. However, the above mentioned measures for preventing the onset and progression of DKD are only partially effective. Furthermore, strict metabolic control is difficult so additional and alternative treatment options are needed. Heparin and related substances may be promising in the prevention of DKD.</P>
<P>In our search for studies investigating heparin and related substances, no study focused on the prevention of incidence or onset of DKD, and we found no studies suitable for inclusion in this review. Therefore, we were not able to draw conclusions about whether heparin and related substances might prevent the incidence of DKD. Because of the severity and heavy burden of DKD, well-designed RCTs are needed to guide clinical practice for the prevention of DKD.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-26 17:30:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Through the search and assessment, it was difficult to find studies concentrating on the prevention of DKD. Few studies observed the onset of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. More studies (such as <LINK REF="STD-Achour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Achour 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2007</LINK>) put their emphasis on the effect of heparin and related substances on progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria or regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria. Furthermore, some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kalani 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scroggie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scroggie 2003</LINK>), which observed the use of heparin and related substances in patients with diabetes, did not provide the data on the onset of DKD or microalbuminuria. Future research should concentrate on heparin and related substances for the prevention of DKD. Well-designed RCTs are needed to guide clinical practice about the prevention of the incidence or onset of DKD.</P>
