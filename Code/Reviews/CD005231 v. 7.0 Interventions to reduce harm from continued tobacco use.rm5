<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:51:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low-tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced-nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long-term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence </B>
</P>
<P>The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long-term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-06 09:33:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Although smoking cessation is currently the only guaranteed way to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoking, a reasonable secondary tobacco control approach may be to try and reduce the harm from continued tobacco use amongst smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Possible approaches to reduce the exposure to toxins from smoking include reducing the amount of tobacco used, and using less toxic products, such as pharmaceutical, nicotine and potential reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs), as an alternative to cigarettes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:39:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of interventions intended to reduce the harm to health of continued tobacco use, we considered the following specific questions: do interventions intended to reduce harm have an effect on long-term health status?; do they lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked?; do they have an effect on smoking abstinence?; do they have an effect on biomarkers of tobacco exposure?; and do they have an effect on biomarkers of damage caused by tobacco?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-06 09:11:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Trials Register (CRS) on the 21st October 2015, using free-text and MeSH terms for harm reduction, smoking reduction and cigarette reduction.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-02 11:10:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce the amount smoked, or to reduce harm from smoking by means other than cessation. We include studies carried out in smokers with no immediate desire to quit all tobacco use. Primary outcomes were change in cigarette consumption, smoking cessation and any markers of damage or benefit to health, measured at least six months from the start of the intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-06 09:12:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We assessed study eligibility for inclusion using standard Cochrane methods. We pooled trials with similar interventions and outcomes (&gt; 50% reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD) and long-term smoking abstinence), using fixed-effect models. Where it was not possible to meta-analyse data, we summarized findings narratively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-07 13:49:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-four trials evaluated interventions to help those who smoke to cut down the amount smoked or to replace their regular cigarettes with PREPs, compared to placebo, brief intervention, or a comparison intervention. None of these trials directly tested whether harm reduction strategies reduced the harms to health caused by smoking. Most trials (14/24) tested nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as an intervention to assist reduction. In a pooled analysis of eight trials, NRT significantly increased the likelihood of reducing CPD by at least 50% for people using nicotine gum or inhaler or a choice of product compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 2.13; 3081 participants). Where average changes from baseline were compared for different measures, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine generally showed smaller reductions than CPD. Use of NRT versus placebo also significantly increased the likelihood of ultimately quitting smoking (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.44; 8 trials, 3081 participants; quality of the evidence: low). Two trials comparing NRT and behavioural support to brief advice found a significant effect on reduction, but no significant effect on cessation. We found one trial investigating each of the following harm reduction intervention aids: bupropion, varenicline, electronic cigarettes, snus, plus another of nicotine patches to facilitate temporary abstinence. The evidence for all five intervention types was therefore imprecise, and it is unclear whether or not these aids increase the likelihood of smoking reduction or cessation. Two trials investigating two different types of behavioural advice and instructions on reducing CPD also provided imprecise evidence. Therefore, the evidence base for this comparison is inadequate to support the use of these types of behavioural advice to reduce smoking. Four studies of PREPs (cigarettes with reduced levels of tar, carbon and nicotine, and in one case delivered using an electronically-heated cigarette smoking system) showed some reduction in exposure to some toxicants, but it is unclear whether this would substantially alter the risk of harm. We judged the included studies to be generally at a low or unclear risk of bias; however, there were some ratings of high risk, due to a lack of blinding and the potential for detection bias. Using the GRADE system, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our cessation outcomes as &#8216;low&#8217; or &#8216;very low&#8217;, due to imprecision and indirectness. A &#8216;low&#8217; grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A &#8216;very low&#8217; grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 09:16:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>People who do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke and to quit smoking in the long term, using NRT, despite original intentions not to do so. However, we rated the evidence contributing to the cessation outcome for NRT as 'low' by GRADE standards. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of other harm reduction aids to reduce the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. This could simply be due to the lack of high-quality studies (our confidence in cessation outcomes for these aids is rated 'low' or 'very low' due to imprecision by GRADE standards), meaning that we may have missed a worthwhile effect, or due to a lack of effect on reduction or quit rates. It is therefore important that more high-quality RCTs are conducted, and that these also measure the long-term health effects of treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-07 11:50:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-02 14:00:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The morbidity and mortality associated with smoking is well established. People who stop smoking can reduce their risk of developing smoking-related diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 2004</LINK>), so the primary strategy for reducing harm due to tobacco smoking must be to encourage cessation. However, despite the fact that most people who smoke say that they want to stop, the prevalence of smoking is declining very slowly, even in those countries where tobacco control policies are well developed, and in some cases prevalence is still rising (<LINK REF="REF-Bilano-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilano 2015</LINK>). In 2005 the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control formalized a global commitment to reduce tobacco use worldwide and make tobacco control a global health priority (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In 2014, based on this Framework, the WHO member states went on to agree a target of a 30% relative reduction in tobacco use worldwide by 2025 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). However, based on the actual decline in smoking prevalence, predictions of trends to 2025 suggest that only 25% of countries worldwide will be likely to experience this decrease in smoking men, and only 52% will be likely to experience this decrease in smoking women from 2010 to 2025. This means fewer than half of countries globally are likely to meet the WHO targets, and this issue is not limited only to low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bilano-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilano 2015</LINK>). Although it is important to continue to motivate and assist people to quit, it may therefore be reasonable to seek ways to reduce the harm from continued smoking for people who are not ready to or cannot quit, as a secondary strategy to improve global health.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-06 09:34:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There are multiple approaches that may have potential for harm reduction for people who do not want to give up tobacco or nicotine use completely. <LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2002</LINK> has provided a catalogue of these with a conceptual structure of their characteristics. They cover many different intended intermediate effects and mechanisms. They also differ in the likely ease of the behaviour change needed to adopt them and related appeal to smokers, and their expected population risk. <LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2002</LINK> categorizes tobacco harm reduction into the following four approaches:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Methods to establish and adhere to tobacco abstinence, as acknowledged above;</LI>
<LI>The use of tobacco products in a way or in a form that is less harmful than traditional products;</LI>
<LI>The use of pharmaceutical products to reduce tobacco use or the harm caused; and</LI>
<LI>Changes in behaviours that will reduce harm.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Categories two to four are the subject of this review.</P>
<P>Products that fall within the second category are referred to as potential reduced-exposure products (PREPs), which are:</P>
<P>"(a) modified tobacco products that contain reduced levels of one or more toxins (for example, cigarettes with reduced tobacco-specific nitrosamines through new curing processes, the addition of catalysts to reduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens produced by smoke, the use of genetically modified plants to reduce nicotine or nitrosamines, or the use of filters to selectively reduce toxicants), (b) cigarette-like devices, such as those that heat rather than burn tobacco, and (c) oral non-combustible products, such as snus" (<LINK REF="REF-Hatsukami-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatsukami 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some oral smokeless tobacco products have been estimated to be approximately 90% less harmful than smoking cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2004</LINK>). Research on alternative tobacco products has largely been conducted within the tobacco industry and has generally attempted to modify the characteristics of existing tobacco-containing products, or to design new types of commercial tobacco products, to make tobacco use less dangerous. Very large, independently-conducted, long-term trials are required to fully evaluate their effects (<LINK REF="REF-Murrelle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murrelle 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of pharmaceutical products to reduce harm could, for example, refer to using any of the existing pharmacotherapies already available to help people to quit smoking, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion, to reduce tobacco consumption. There is variation in whether NRT is licensed for use as a reduction aid across countries; for example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not approved the use of NRT for smokers who wish to cut down the amount they smoke without wanting to quit. However, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA) in the UK have licensed it for this purpose. Finally, "changes in behaviors that will reduce harm" applies to behaviour change interventions such as reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day (CPD), otherwise known as 'controlled smoking', which could be carried out alongside the use of other aids, such as PREPs or pharmaceutical products.</P>

<P>There are two major routes through which we would expect the above harm reduction approaches to work: 1) by promoting subsequent smoking cessation, as a by-product of harm reduction (rather than encouraging quitting specifically); and 2) by reducing the health effects of smoking without quitting completely. There is evidence that the smoking reduction potentially promoted by the majority of harm reduction approaches is associated with an increase in subsequent cessation. A qualitative systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2006</LINK>) of 19 observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no indication that CPD reduction had a negative impact on future cessation; in fact, 16 of the 19 studies found reduction was associated with higher eventual quit rates.This association may be because reduction increases self-efficacy, disrupts pharmacological conditioning or reduces dependence, or both. However, there is also evidence that attempts at smoking reduction can be undermined by other unconscious adjustments to smoking behaviour, for example taking longer, deeper puffs of a cigarette to maintain previous nicotine levels (<LINK REF="REF-Scherer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 1999</LINK>). Using an alternative reduced-harm nicotine source (such as NRT, snus, electronic cigarettes (ecigs)) to support behavioural reduction could help to compensate for this, by reducing nicotine withdrawal and subsequent cravings. In Sweden the use of snus as a cigarette substitute has been credited for a reduction in smoking among men, which is associated with lower tobacco-related mortality rates in Sweden than in other European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ramstrom-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramstrom 2014</LINK>). There is mixed evidence for the effects of smoking reduction on disease and health markers. For example, a systematic review reports that their largest included study found a reduction in lung cancer risk in smokers who reduced consumption compared with those who maintained their smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Pisinger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisinger 2007</LINK>); however, a later study found no evidence of a reduction in risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2013</LINK>). There is some evidence that smoking reduction can reduce biomarkers related to the risk of cancer or carcinogen exposure, or both; however, it is unclear whether this reduces the incidence of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Pisinger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisinger 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most evidence investigating the link between smoking reduction and health currently comes from observational, epidemiological studies, and there are issues with this. Firstly, because smoking is generally measured at two time points and if the later one demonstrates a lower rate than the initial one, it is assumed that smoking reduction has been maintained throughout the follow-up period, which may not be the case. Secondly, many of the studies have not used biomarkers to validate smoking consumption, which could mean that compensatory smoking (such as deeper puffs) is not accounted for. Finally, many of these studies have not included people who used alternative nicotine products to compensate for smoking, which may impact on the success of reduction, and therefore on the associated changes in health risks (<LINK REF="REF-Begh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begh 2015</LINK>). The nature of RCTs means that all of these factors can be controlled for more effectively (although this is not always the case), and where this has been done we can be more confident that results indicating associations between reduction and health are causal. By reviewing these studies, we can make a valuable contribution to the literature and to the debate surrounding harm reduction approaches.</P>
<P>However, the use of harm reduction strategies in relation to tobacco smoking is a controversial topic, which divides opinion. There are concerns that encouraging people to reduce their smoking may undermine their motivation to quit smoking in the long term, and that this may encourage the tobacco industry to market 'reduced risk' products and carry out biased research on their effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Hatsukami-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatsukami 2004</LINK>). The availability of ostensibly less harmful tobacco products could even lead never-smokers to start smoking, or ex-smokers to relapse, in the belief that the risks are acceptable. These are questions that cannot be answered by RCTs alone, and are outside the scope of this review; the results of this review should therefore be considered alongside research which investigates any potential negative impact of promoting harm reduction.</P>
<P>Despite the ongoing debate regarding the promotion of tobacco use harm reduction, in 2013 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published their first version of guidance on how to offer harm reduction approaches to smokers unwilling or unable to quit in one step, who may want to use a long-term safer substitute for smoking, or may only be ready to reduce the amount they smoke (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). This guidance therefore recommends some non-traditional interventions where the ultimate goal is still to quit (reducing smoking to quit), but also recommends behavioural smoking reduction with or without the use of NRT, and temporary abstinence with or without NRT for smokers who need to stop smoking for a set period of time, for example, during working hours, a long-haul flight, or a hospital stay. The guidance highlights that the health benefits of smoking reduction, rates of relapse and progression to stopping smoking among people who have opted to reduce the amount they smoke are still unclear, and that better evidence is therefore still required to support and inform the harm reduction approach. In addition, new products, such as ecigs, that have the potential to be used in a harm-reduction capacity have also become available since the last update of this review. Evidence is needed to inform whether these harm reduction interventions could be useful in reducing tobacco-related harm in smokers who cannot, or do not wish to, quit.</P>

<P>The preferred primary outcome was long-term change in health status, but we expected that this was unlikely to be assessed in randomized trials. The most appropriate proxy indicator to demonstrate a reduction in toxin intake from tobacco use, sufficient to lead to a clinically useful long-term health benefit is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Hatsukami-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatsukami 2005a</LINK>). We have therefore considered and extracted any attempt made to measure a health marker.</P>
<P>In the absence of better health indicators, we have also assessed both the change in smoking rate from baseline and smoking cessation as primary outcomes. For smoking reduction outcomes, we preferred prolonged or continuous rates to point prevalence rates. Where studies did not incorporate abstinent participants in their reduction rates we have done this for the purposes of our meta-analyses, as participants who have quit smoking have by definition reduced to zero. As there was no expectation that participants would quit at the start of the intervention, we have favoured measures of abstinence based on behaviour towards the end of the follow-up period (i.e. point prevalence rates) over continuous or sustained abstinence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). We preferred biochemically-validated rates to self-reported rates for both reduction and cessation outcomes. To be eligible for inclusion, a study had to report at least one of these outcomes at least six months following baseline.</P>

<P>Full details of search results are not available for the previous versions of this review; however, the search we carried out for this update identified 659 non-duplicate records. We assessed the titles and abstracts of all of these studies and acquired the full text of 60 (representing 48 studies) to conduct a further eligibility assessment.

<P>We include 24 studies, which aimed to test interventions to reduce the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. Across studies, this involved behaviour change to reduce tobacco consumption or to replace traditional tobacco use with alternative products of (potentially) lower risk, or both. Studies typically recruited between 100 and 200 participants in each intervention or control group. The smallest had 93 participants in total (<LINK REF="STD-Riley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The methods of recruitment were varied. Most studies relied on advertising to attract community volunteers. One study proactively recruited participants by telephoning households and identifying people who smoked (<LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK>). One study used multiple approaches, including direct mail to households (<LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>). One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Hanson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanson 2008</LINK>) was in adolescents in particular, and another specifically recruited electively hospitalized patients from a variety of wards in academic hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Nackaerts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nackaerts 2009</LINK>).Most studies excluded people currently interested in quitting smoking, but the assessments and cut-off points used to establish eligibility varied. Participants generally had to lack current interest in quitting, but some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Batra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolliger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bolliger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haustein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haustein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2008</LINK>) also required past failure in a serious quit attempt. This criterion was intended to exclude people likely to quit easily without assistance. Exceptions were <LINK REF="STD-Kralikova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kralikova 2009</LINK>, where participants were recruited on the basis that they did not <U>have</U> to be motivated to quit (cessation was recommended but not mandatory), and <LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK>, where participants did have to be motivated to quit smoking but the intervention was smokeless tobacco and therefore participants were not willing to quit tobacco completely. However, despite using criteria to exclude people willing to attempt immediate quitting in the main, the long-term motivation to stop smoking often appeared high. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Wennike-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wennike 2003</LINK> reported participants as having an average motivation to quit of 6.6 on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 10. Little information was available on the participants in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Australia-NNCG_x002d_017" TYPE="STUDY">Australia NNCG-017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nackaerts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nackaerts 2009</LINK>).

In the short-term reduction arms participants were asked at baseline to quit at week four, while in the long-term arm participants were asked simply to reduce as much as possible over six months. At the end of the six months, participants were advised that it was preferable to quit altogether; however, this was not the original goal and a specific cessation intervention was not offered. For the purposes of this review we are solely interested in the two long-term reduction arms (comparing nicotine gum to placebo gum). <LINK REF="STD-Hanson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanson 2008</LINK> was borderline for inclusion, and so not included in meta-analyses. This was because after a short period of reduction (four weeks) participants were offered a cessation intervention where they set a quit date and were provided with NRT. There were two intervention arms: one used nicotine gum and the other used nicotine patch; however, these were only provided in the second phase of the study, if participants decided to set a quit day after the period of reduction.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nackaerts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nackaerts 2009</LINK>) investigated the use of nicotine patches versus placebo patches as a substitute for smoking, to induce "temporary abstinence", during hospitalization.</P>
<P>A further two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2008</LINK>) provided repeated counselling and encouragement to use NRT, compared to a control group that received only brief advice on the importance of quitting. <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2011</LINK> further split their counselling + NRT group, so that one group also received add-on counselling to encourage adherence to the NRT. However, for the purposes of our analysis we combined the two counselling + NRT groups and compared them to the brief-advice control. <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2008</LINK> provided participants with nicotine gum, or, if this did not suppress withdrawal, with nicotine patch.</P>
<P>Two other NRT studies did not have a placebo control and were borderline for inclusion. As a result we have not included them in our meta-analyses. In <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2003</LINK> participants were recruited on the basis that they were not interested in quitting immediately, but that they were interested in quitting within the next six months. This was a pilot study, assessing whether assistance with cutting down increased the impact of subsequent brief advice to quit completely. Intervention participants were given a choice of NRT products and a target of reducing their daily cigarette consumption by at least 50% in four weeks, after which they were advised to quit, and given self-help materials to do so if desired. The control group received brief advice to quit at the initial visit, and those who set a quit date were offered NRT but no further support. In <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK> the initial intervention focused on reduction, but participants were advised to quit and those that set a quit date were provided with additional support (i.e. a cessation intervention). <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK> had three arms: a no-intervention control, motivational interviewing intended to increase interest in quitting, and advice to reduce with an offer of NRT. Both intervention arms included eligibility for free NRT if a quit date was set. Both <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK> provided participants with a choice of NRT products (gum, patch or inhaler; and gum or patch respectively).</P>
<P>Across all NRT studies, the maximum length of time NRT could be used to aid reduction ranged from nine months (<LINK REF="STD-Haustein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haustein 2003</LINK>) to 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Bolliger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bolliger 2000</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Nackaerts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nackaerts 2009</LINK> the nicotine patch was used as a complete substitute for smoking rather than whilst reducing. Participants were provided with patches until they were discharged from hospital, for a maximum of seven days.</P>

<P>One USA study (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 2004a</LINK>) offered bupropion or placebo for 26 weeks to people attempting to reduce their smoking, with a target of 50% reduction in cigarettes smoked a day.

<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2011</LINK>, carried out in the USA, randomized participants to either varenicline or placebo for two to eight weeks. Participants were also provided with four counselling sessions (baseline, two weeks, four weeks and eight weeks) on methods that could be used to reduce the amount of cigarettes smoked. The aim of the study was to see whether varenicline would induce quit attempts in smokers who were not currently planning to quit. Final follow-up was six months after baseline.</P>

<P>Another single study (<LINK REF="STD-Caponnetto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Caponnetto 2013</LINK>) encouraged participants who did not intend to quit to reduce their cigarette-smoking using electronic cigarettes (ecigs). There were three arms, all of which were instructed to use an ecig ab libitum; the difference between the three study arms was the nicotine content of the ecig nicotine cartridges provided (7.2 mg; 5.4 mg; 0 mg). Participants received 12 weeks-worth of cartridges. The identical appearance of the ecigs and cartridges was intended to blind participants and investigators to their treatment allocation. The study took place in Italy, at the Universita di Catania, and had a follow-up of one year.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK>, which took place in Serbia, used the smokeless tobacco product, snus, to encourage participants to reduce their smoking. Although participants were told that their ultimate goal should be to quit, the aim in the first 24 weeks was solely cigarette reduction. We included this study despite the goal to quit cigarettes, as it instructed participants to switch to snus, and therefore not to quit tobacco completely. Participants were told to use a sachet of snus every time they felt the urge to smoke. The control group received placebo sachets of smokeless tobacco, which were almost identical to the snus product in appearance, feel, pH and taste, but contained no nicotine or tobacco. Study follow-up took place up to two years post-baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK> was sponsored by Swedish Match.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other PREPs (excluding smokeless tobacco)</HEADING>
<P>There were also four studies comparing PREPs (excluding smokeless tobacco) to conventional cigarette use (<LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roethig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roethig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK>). For the purposes of this review we present studies of smokeless tobacco separately from these other PREPs, which were all products mimicking cigarette smoking whilst potentially reducing the intake of harmful components. Three of the PREP studies were funded by a tobacco company (<LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roethig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roethig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK>), and the fourth was funded by the National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, but a tobacco company provided the research cigarettes (<LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK>). All four studies investigated products designed to reduce the risks of smoking in different ways. <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK> evaluated light and ultra-light tar cigarettes compared to continued use of conventional cigarettes; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK> investigated carbon-filtered cigarettes; <LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK> investigated reduced-nicotine content cigarettes, and <LINK REF="STD-Roethig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roethig 2008</LINK> evaluated an electrically-heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS), a device used to smoke regular cigarettes, rather than an ecig. These studies had six- to 12-month follow-up, including regular research clinic visits for collection of samples for biochemical assessment of levels of markers of exposure and risk.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two studies investigated behavioural interventions to change smoking behaviour without the use of pharmaceutical aids, nicotine or tobacco substitutes for cigarettes. <LINK REF="STD-Riley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 2002</LINK>, involving community volunteers only interested in reduction, compared two guided methods to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. One intervention used computerized scheduled smoking to achieve a gradual reduction to 50% of baseline in two weeks. The comparison condition provided a treatment guide instructing in gradual reduction by selectively eliminating cigarettes. <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2009</LINK> provided an intervention for members of a Health Maintenance Organization who were due to have outpatient surgery or a diagnostic procedure via telephone. The individualized counselling consisted of participants being advised to gradually reduce their cigarette smoking by 50% or more, with cessation encouraged following reduction. This intervention was compared to usual care in the form of usual care plus generic health mailings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The main outcomes in most of the included studies were reduction or cessation, and these all had follow-up of at least six months. However, three of the studies investigating PREPs measured neither reduction nor cessation, and instead used biochemical assessments to measure potential markers of health risk. The smoking reduction and cessation outcomes used in this review were all assessed at least one month after the end of the treatment period, as well as being at least six months after the start of the intervention. The most consistently used reduction outcome was a reduction in self-reported cigarettes a day of more than 50% from baseline. Most studies used sustained reduction at multiple follow-ups, validated by any level of reduction in baseline CO. Other reduction measures reported in some studies were average reduction in CPD, and average reduction in CO levels, cotinine levels and thiocyanate levels. These reductions could be expressed as absolute or percentage reductions, and were typically calculated using available data without imputing values for dropouts, and included people who were no longer smoking at assessment.</P>
<P>In those studies that did investigate health outcomes, analyses of changes in biomarker levels amongst reducers did not always distinguish between treatment groups. In addition, the wide variation in the markers used and the ways these were assessed meant that we could not attempt meta-analysis for these outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ongoing studies</HEADING>
<P>During the 2016 update we also identified three studies deemed to be ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Caponetto-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Caponetto 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02124187" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02124187</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taskila-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taskila 2012</LINK>), where results are not currently available. These may be eligible for inclusion in a subsequent update. <LINK REF="STD-Caponetto-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Caponetto 2014</LINK> is another ecig study which recruited people with schizophrenia with no intention of quitting.

<P>We found a variety of other studies which were potentially relevant but did not meet our inclusion criteria because they recruited participants that wanted to quit as a short-term aim, or the aim of the study was to quit smoking rather than to simply to reduce smoking or harm. Another common reason for exclusion was that the long-term change in smoking behaviour and associated change in biomarkers of harm were not a target of the study. Many of these were very short-term within-subject cross-over studies of smokers switching to PREPs developed by the tobacco industry. Another short-term excluded study used payment for reduced levels of carbon monoxide to encourage smoking reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2005</LINK>). One study estimated the amount of compensatory smoking in people switching to lower-tar cigarette brands (<LINK REF="STD-Frost-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frost 1995</LINK>).

<P>We judged 15 of the included studies to be at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation. This was simply because the studies stated that they were randomized but then did not specify how the randomization sequence was generated, making it impossible to judge whether or not this was done adequately. We judged all other studies to be at low risk of bias for sequence generation, as they reported being randomized with a robust method of sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Bolliger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bolliger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caponnetto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Caponnetto 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haustein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haustein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Loss to follow-up was high in some trials. Although this is also a problem in cessation trials where participants wish to quit, study reports indicate that it was a larger problem in this population of smokers who were not as motivated to change their smoking behaviour. We rated three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK>) at high risk of bias for this domain, as there was a substantial difference in dropout rates between study groups.</P>
<P>Outcomes derived from continuous variables (mainly markers of health outcomes) were generally reported for continuing participants only. If dropouts are less likely to have changed their behaviour, these outcomes will overestimate the change in the trial population. In using a dichotomous outcome for reduction in cigarettes and calculating rates on an intention-to-treat basis, we, like the trialists, made the assumption that dropouts had not reduced by more than 50%. This will underestimate the change in the population if our assumption is incorrect. It does not remove the potential to introduce bias if the true change in behaviour amongst dropouts is confounded by treatment group. The trials of PREPs had particularly high losses to follow-up, which was higher in groups using the unfamiliar products.</P>

<P>We pooled eight trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in adults. Overall there was a statistically significant effect of NRT on the likelihood of reducing cigarette use by 50% or more from baseline (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 2.13; 3081 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

Two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kralikova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kralikova 2009</LINK>, contributed most weight to the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK> used self-reported reduction and many more participants claimed to have reduced than in other studies, although the relative effect of treatment was smaller. We used data from the two-year follow-up in the analyses but also tested the sensitivity to the use of five-year follow-up data. <LINK REF="STD-Kralikova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kralikova 2009</LINK> was not typical because participants appear to have been more motivated to quit than to reduce, and many did so. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of excluding these two studies. Since they showed relatively less effect on reduction, the effect was to increase the point estimate whilst widening the confidence intervals and reducing heterogeneity. However, the effect was still statistically significant (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 4.08, I = 9%; 2233 participants). <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK> also had a non-placebo control group, not included in the analyses above. Including this group in the control condition would have increased the effect. Using the five-year data for this study did not substantially alter the result.</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis to see whether the effect differed according to the type of NRT being used (i.e. a choice of NRT, nicotine gum, or nicotine inhaler; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), and found that NRT resulted in significantly more reducers than placebo in all cases. However, there is evidence of between-group differences (P = 0.009) with nicotine gum (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.00, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%; 1404 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2) and nicotine inhaler (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.70 to 6.77, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; 829 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.3), resulting in more reducers than choice of NRT (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.75, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; 848 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.3) relative to placebo.</P>

We again produced a subgroup analysis to assess any effect of the type of NRT used. No significant differences emerged between subgroups.

<LINK REF="STD-Nackaerts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nackaerts 2009</LINK> was the only study in the review which investigated the use of NRT (specifically nicotine patches) to aid temporary abstinence.

<P>In two studies the control groups did not get a placebo and there was the option of a cessation intervention at the end of the short-term reduction intervention (as previously discussed, these studies were borderline included and therefore not pooled in meta-analyses). In the first (<LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2003</LINK>), cessation rates were non-significantly different (5/32 versus 3/35, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.47 to 7.02) and non-quitters reduced their CPD compared to controls. In the second (<LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK>), reduction and quit rates were significantly higher in the NRT and behavioural support group than in the no-treatment control, but advice to reduce before quitting had similar effects on reduction and cessation to the motivational interviewing intervention designed to increase interest in quitting. We did not pool one small pilot study amongst adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Hanson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanson 2008</LINK>), which also gave the option of a cessation intervention after a four-week reduction intervention. Furthermore, cessation was not reported by group and a reduction of more than 50% was not reported at six-month+ follow-up. There was no evidence of any treatment effects, and although average CPD was smaller in all three conditions at six months, average CO and cotinine levels were non-significantly higher than at baseline.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adverse events (AEs)</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the fourteen NRT studies compared one arm receiving NRT to another arm receiving placebo or no NRT, and reported on adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolliger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bolliger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haustein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haustein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kralikova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kralikova 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennike-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wennike 2003</LINK>). The reporting across studies was generally sparse and varied. There was some evidence of a small elevation in non-serious adverse events in the study arms receiving active treatment; for example, <LINK REF="STD-Haustein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haustein 2003</LINK> found that nausea and vomiting were more common in the active (59/193) than in the placebo group (17/192); <LINK REF="STD-Kralikova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kralikova 2009</LINK> found that 82 adverse events occurred in the active arm versus 26 in the placebo arm (N = 209 and 105 respectively); and <LINK REF="STD-Batra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2005</LINK> reported 506 AEs in the active group and 370 in the control group (N = 184 and 180 respectively). However, this is also true for NRT used for cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>), and there were no reports of any serious adverse events that might have been attributed to NRT use alongside continued smoking in any of the studies reporting safety outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other markers of cigarette consumption</HEADING>
<P>We summarize reported changes in CPD, CO, thiocyanate and cotinine, expressed as percentage or absolute differences from baseline values, for the studies for which data were available in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> (NRT versus placebo) and <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK> (NRT + counselling versus brief advice). Studies typically showed reductions from baseline in both treatment and control groups, but this was usually based on continuing participants only. Differences between groups where reported were not always statistically significant. Because of the multiple differences in the ways in which changes were calculated and reported, we did not attempt any formal meta-analysis.</P>
<P>People who reduce their cigarette consumption may inadvertently compensate for the reduction in nicotine by smoking the remaining cigarettes more 'efficiently' and therefore do not reduce their intake of toxins as much as might be suggested from CPD. Using NRT to assist reduction may help avoid this compensation, so that toxin levels are reduced more for a similar level of CPD reduction. We found relatively little data about either compensation generally amongst reducers, or differential levels of compensation for NRT and placebo users. <LINK REF="STD-Bolliger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bolliger 2000</LINK> reported that at 24 months sustained reducers had an average CPD of 25% of baseline, whilst CO and cotinine levels were only about 50% of baseline. The same study presented data on cigarette and CO reduction in the subgroup of intervention and placebo participants who were still using inhalers daily at various points during the treatment phase. After 18 months, the 22 active inhaler-users had an average reduction in CPD of 64% of baseline with a range of 0% to 100%. CO levels were only reduced by an average of 29% of baseline. Changes in CO levels ranged from a decrease of 92% to an increase of 222%. The eight placebo-users had a significantly smaller (P = 0.02) percentage reduction in CPD than the active inhaler-users (reduced to 33% of baseline, range 20% to 100%) and a non-significantly smaller percentage reduction in CO (reduced to 82% of baseline, range 50% to 177%). <LINK REF="STD-Batra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2005</LINK> reported the proportion of participants with a sustained reduction in CO levels of over 20% from baseline at 13-month follow-up. The proportions achieving this (13.6% active versus 5.6% placebo) were higher in both conditions than the proportion reporting sustained reduction greater than 50% in CPD, suggesting that all the reducers had achieved at least a 20% reduction in CO.</P>

Results were not reported by treatment group, and we cannot separate the benefit of quitting from that of reducing; there was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

Smoking reduction in participants who never attempted to quit, as defined by a reduction in urinary cotinine of more than 50%, was greater during the treatment phase but did not differ significantly at 12-month follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.67; 594 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>.2). Reduction in cotinine more than 50%: 2% (3/153) bupropion versus 5% (8/174) placebo, not statistically significant (P = 0.17) excludes participants who entered the cessation arm of the study.

<LINK REF="STD-Caponnetto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Caponnetto 2013</LINK> was the only completed study investigating ecigs as a harm reduction aid at the time of the searches. The study compared nicotine and non-nicotine ecigs, and found that there was a reduction in the number of regular cigarettes smoked, but without statistically significant between-group differences. The RR for more than a 50% reduction at one-year follow-up was 1.28 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.17; 300 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>.1), and for abstinence 2.75 (95% CI 0.97 to 7.76; 300 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>.2); both were statistically non-significantly in favour of ecigs with nicotine cartridges.

<P>The one study (<LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK>) that investigated replacing cigarette smoking with another form of tobacco (smokeless, snus) found that there was not a significant difference in the number who achieved more than a 50% cigarette reduction (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.11; 319 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.1) and complete abstinence (RR 3.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 11.08; 319 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.2) between the active and placebo groups at six months. However, statistically significantly more participants in the snus group achieved more than a 75% reduction at six-month follow-up (15/158, 9.5% in the snus group and 4/161, 2.5% in the placebo group; P = 0.01). It should be noted that the last of these analyses was the result of an exploratory, post hoc investigation. Although this study went on to 48-month follow-up, we only use the data up to 24 months here, as after this point anyone who had not reduced by more than 50% or quit was excluded. When we assessed markers of consumption (CPD, CO and cotinine) as continuous measures, there were no significant between-group differences at 48 weeks; however, in both groups CPD and cotinine reduced by approximately a third, and CO reduced by around half (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of health markers were measured; however, in no case did we find any differences over time or between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other PREPs (excluding smokeless tobacco)</HEADING>
<P>We summarize the main findings of these four studies narratively. All reported data on multiple biomarkers at multiple follow-up points (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). Difficulties in interpreting the results include the large variation between participants, and the loss to follow-up of participants who did not maintain use of the test products. Some measures showed marked changes from baseline to the end of follow-up; for example, CPD typically increased in both experimental and control groups. Switching from full-strength (F) to low- (L) or very low-tar (UL) cigarettes (<LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK>) led to significantly lower average nicotine levels in the UL than in the F groups. CPD increased in all groups, possibly because cigarettes were provided free in a residential clinic. Carboxyhaemaglobin (COHb) levels were similar between the F and UL groups, but higher in the L groups. Overall, although some exposures were reduced in the heavy smokers who switched to lower-tar alternatives, the absolute differences were not large, even when statistically significant. Use of carbon-filtered low- and medium-tar cigarettes led to reduced levels of gas phase biomarkers, but had no impact on particulate phase biomarkers (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK>). Using an electrically-heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS) reduced exposure to tobacco smoke constituents, especially carboxyhaemoglobin. Nicotine levels were reduced, which, combined with the higher dropout in the EHCSS group, suggests that the device may not have been very acceptable to smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Roethig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roethig 2008</LINK>). In this study markers or cardiovascular risk factors including white blood cell counts and levels of HDL and LDL did show significant change in favourable directions compared to conventional cigarette use. <LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK> conducted bi-weekly clinics in a community clinic setting, a slightly different context to the aforementioned studies. This may account for the fact that cigarette consumption stayed relatively stable in both study conditions (reduced nicotine content-cigarettes versus usual cigarettes). Markers of consumption, such as CO, and cardiovascular biomarkers also stayed approximately the same in both groups. However, markers of nicotine consumption decreased in the group receiving reduced nicotine content-cigarettes. It would seem that, although nicotine consumption was successfully reduced in the experimental group, this did not result in participants compensating for this by smoking more cigarettes and thereby increasing their CO consumption.</P>
<P>None of the four studies of PREPs reported reduction as a binary outcome (with a 50% cut-off), and only <LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK> assessed and reported smoking cessation. Only very small numbers quit (2/80 in the experimental, reduced nicotine cigarettes group, and 1/55 in the control, regular cigarettes group), resulting in a statistically non-significant effect, with very wide confidence intervals (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 14.79; 135 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).</P>

There were also reductions in CO which did not differ between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>). Point prevalence quit rates were higher at 12-month follow-up than at the end of treatment in both groups, suggesting no deterrent effect on quitting. At 12 months quit rates were statistically non-significantly higher in the computer scheduled group than the selective reduction group (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.47 to 7.32; 93 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>.2).</P>

The proportions reducing CO by more than 50% were also similar across groups at 12 months (14.0% versus 14.1%). When we looked at the overall continuous rates of CPD and CO reduction, both groups had reduced their cigarette consumption (by approximately a quarter of their baseline rate) and CO levels (by approximately a sixth of their baseline rate) on average (<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-07 15:38:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review assess ways to help people who smoke to potentially reduce the harm caused by their smoking, either by reducing the number of cigarettes they smoke (with the help of behavioural methods to encourage change, or using pharmaceutical, nicotine or reduced-risk tobacco products as partial substitutes, or both), or by fully substituting regular tobacco products with 'reduced-risk' alternatives.</P>
<P>Studies included tested a wide range of approaches in the form of harm reduction interventions: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); bupropion; varenicline; ecigarettes (ecigs); snus; other potential reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs); behavioural reduction advice; and a computerized smoking reduction programme. The opportunities for meta-analyses were limited, but there is evidence that NRT has an effect on successful smoking reduction (50%+ reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD)) and quit rates. There is insufficient evidence to suggest whether or not other harm reduction interventions are effective in reducing the harm caused by tobacco. Included trials suggest that people who use NRT to reduce their smoking are more likely to be able to reduce their cigarette consumption than people attempting to reduce with placebo. All the trials included a follow-up period when NRT was no longer provided, and one trial had follow-up 20 months after the end of NRT provision. There was no evidence that using NRT, with an aim to assist reduction, diverted people from attempting to quit, since cessation rates were also higher in NRT-treated groups. Whilst the trial evidence supports the concept of using NRT to reduce the amount smoked, showing a significant effect and an effect size that would be clinically important in many treatments, the absolute benefit from this use of NRT seems to be small. NRT increased the number of long-term sustained reducers, but against a background of very little reduction amongst the control group. Treatment typically increased the proportion of successful reducers from 1 - 3% to 6 - 9%, and the health benefit even for these people is unclear.</P>
<P>Some of the included studies allowed a comparison between change in CPD and changes in other measure of exposure to tobacco smoke. Data on markers of consumption are typically reported in different ways across studies, which makes it difficult to produce pooled across-study estimates of changes. However, these studies confirm that the extent to which participants reduced their CPD consumption was typically greater than the observed percentage reduction in other measures of their exposure to tobacco smoke, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennike-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wennike 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2009</LINK>). Another review has estimated that the reduction in CO is typically about a third less than the reduction in CPD (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2005</LINK>). However, it should be noted that as the baseline CO reading in a non-smoker is typically not zero, one would not necessarily expect percentage reductions in CO and CPD to map directly on to each other, even in the absence of compensatory smoking.</P>
<P>As predicted, studies provided very little information on changes in health or markers of this. Where this was reported, between-group comparisons were generally not made. Where they were made, there appeared to be no evidence of consistent benefits resulting from any of the interventions in terms of health and markers of health. Reporting on adverse effects was limited, but those studies that did report on them found nothing that has not already been detected when using the medications tested for their more traditional indication of cessation. This suggests that there is no additional risk of using NRT, bupropion, ecigs or varenicline for the purposes of harm reduction.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 11:31:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The field of harm reduction has progressed since the last update of this review was published in 2007 (partially demonstrated by the NICE harm reduction guidance published in the interim (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). As a result, there is a wider range of interventions aiming for tobacco harm reduction (for example, ecigs). We took this into account and expanded our search terms for this update, making the search less sensitive and allowing us to broaden our reach for relevant studies. As a result we are confident that we have accounted for changes in the research field and have found the available, relevant literature. As expected we identified studies testing interventions new to this review (e.g. varenicline, snus, ecigs); however, in most cases we found only one study for each intervention, limiting the power needed to detect an effect, and hence the strength of the conclusions we can draw, due to imprecision. NRT therefore remains the only intervention for which there were multiple studies and for which we could produce meta-analyses. The lack of investigation into alternative approaches could account for the lack of effects observed in reducing smoking and increasing abstinence rates. The effect estimates with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals for harm reduction interventions other than NRT overlap with those in our meta-analysis of NRT studies, so it is plausible that all medications work equally to support reduction, but further high-quality research would need to test this assumption.</P>
<P>The primary outcome which we wished to test in this review was long-term health, and it was impossible to do so. This would have given us a clearer idea of any benefits of harm reduction for those people who do not achieve cessation. Some studies measured biomarkers of health risk, but these were typically measured at short-term follow-up, inconsistently across studies, and only in those participants who had not dropped out earlier from the study. In many cases comparisons were only between those who had successfully changed their behaviour versus those who had not, rather than across randomized groups, making it impossible to assess the effects of the intervention in comparison to the control condition. However, cessation results in substantial health benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 2004</LINK>), so this was still a valuable outcome to assess.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-06 11:31:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For a number of 'Risk of bias' domains across studies, we rated the risks of bias as unclear, due to a lack of reporting. For instance, a number of trials (particularly those of NRT versus placebo) were described as "blinded", but without full details of how this was carried out, i.e. who was blinded and how it was done. In these cases bias is probably not a problem, but we cannot be sure. Some studies provided different harm reduction aids, or administered aids differently across study groups, meaning the studies were impossible to blind; we judged them to be at high risk of performance bias. Another key concern for research in the field of harm reduction is that it may motivate those with a stake in the tobacco industry to manufacture and test 'reduced-harm' alternatives to tobacco, in order to provide an alternative to complete cessation. All of the studies testing PREPs (including snus) in this review were in some way linked to the tobacco industry: <LINK REF="STD-Joksi_x0107_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joksi&#263; 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roethig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Roethig 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 2008</LINK> were all sponsored by the tobacco industry. <LINK REF="STD-Benowitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Benowitz 2012</LINK> was not, but the test cigarettes were supplied directly by the tobacco industry.</P>
<P>We planned to assess the quality of the evidence contributing to long-term health status outcomes using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2012</LINK>). However, this proved impossible, as no studies reported on this outcome. As cessation is the only other outcome that we know can be used as an accurate measure of harm reduction, we have used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence contributing to the main comparison for each harm reduction aid (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In most cases we rated the evidence as 'low', and in some cases (low-nicotine cigarettes versus regular cigarettes; behavioural reduction advice versus health mailings) 'very low'. Across all outcomes this was due to imprecision, i.e. a small number of studies, resulting in a small number of events and wide confidence intervals around the effect size. In the case of the low-nicotine cigarettes versus regular cigarettes cessation outcome this was also due to the fact that the study treatments were unblinded, providing the potential for detection bias, and that there were differential participant dropout rates between study groups. In the case of the behavioural reduction advice versus health mailings cessation outcome we also downgraded the evidence due to indirectness. The only study investigating this comparison was conducted in a very specific population (people awaiting surgery), and so the findings may not be applicable to the general population.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-06 11:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The literature investigating the potential health benefits of interventions aimed at reducing smoking behaviour is very conflicted, and no clear conclusions have been drawn (<LINK REF="REF-Begh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begh 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tverdal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tverdal 2006</LINK>), leaving the overall public health benefit uncertain. Unfortunately, the data on biomarkers of health reviewed here do not resolve these problems. This is largely due to the design and reporting of the studies, which could be improved in future research.</P>
<P>An earlier review of the use of PREPs specifically to reduce harm concluded that "there is no evidence to suggest that there is enough of a reduction in tobacco toxin exposure with any of the existing PREPs to expect a significant reduction in disease risk, nor do we know the extent of toxin exposure reduction that is necessary to result in reduction of disease" (<LINK REF="REF-UMN-TTURC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UMN TTURC 2005</LINK>). Of particular note is that some participants using some types of PREPs had higher levels of CO than they had when smoking normally (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Fagerstr_x00f6_m-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fagerstrm 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagerstr_x00f6_m-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Fagerstrm 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strasser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 2007</LINK>). This may be because smokers overestimate the 'reduced risk' of PREPs and compensate for this by consciously smoking more, or because smokers using PREPs are withdrawing from the component of the PREP that has been reduced and are increasing their cigarette consumption to compensate for this.</P>
<P>Aside from the direct health benefits that could be achieved by reducing smoking and the harmful components of cigarettes, harm reduction interventions could improve public health by ultimately leading to greater cessation rates in the long term. Limited evidence means this is currently difficult to assess across harm reduction interventions; however, the pooled group of studies comparing NRT to placebo in adults provides support for this hypothesis. This may occur because smoking reduction acts as a mediator of the effect of harm reduction interventions on cessation. Our review also found that the studies comparing NRT to placebo demonstrated a positive association between successful reduction and the intervention. Reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Asfar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asfar 2011</LINK>, also investigating the association between reduction and quitting, have found that the two are positively linked. However, in <LINK REF="REF-Asfar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asfar 2011</LINK> (which, like us, only looked at studies of smokers unwilling or unable to quit) this was only the case when interventions involved pharmacotherapy to aid reduction; the evidence was inconclusive for interventions offering only behavioural support.</P>
<P>NRT, bupropion, varenicline and behavioural reduce-to-quit interventions have all been found to be effective cessation interventions in smokers who would like to quit (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindson_x002d_Hawley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindson-Hawley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>). The evidence for ecigs as a quitting aid is sparse, but the two randomized controlled trials included in the Cochrane Review on the subject indicate that they also have a favourable effect on quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Hartmann_x002d_Boyce-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann-Boyce 2016</LINK>).</P>

<UL>
<LI>Some people who smoke and do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down the number of cigarettes smoked and their intake of carbon monoxide by using NRT as a harm reduction aid.</LI>
<LI>There is not enough evidence on whether varenicline, bupropion, ecigarettes, behavioural advice alone, snus or other potential reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs) help to reduce smoking rates, enhance quit rates, or reduce harm in any way when used as a harm reduction aid.</LI>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence of a long-term health benefit of any interventions intended to help people reduce or alter but not quit tobacco use. However, there is evidence that reduction supported by NRT can increase the chances of complete cessation. Bearing this potential benefit in mind, alongside the strong safety profile of NRT, the benefits of advising smokers unwilling or unable to quit smoking to reduce their smoking using NRT are likely to outweigh any disadvantages, given that the alternative is likely to be no action.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-04 09:44:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<UL>
<LI>The tobacco research field has developed a standard for assessing smoking abstinence (the Russell Standard) aimed at improving the reporting of smoking cessation trials (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). The tobacco harm reduction field would benefit from developing similar standards to improve the consistency, quality and relevance of outcomes reported in this area.</LI>
<LI>More high-quality studies with long-term follow-up are required, to aid the development of public health guidance, particularly considering the debate in the field and the emergence of ecigarettes.</LI>
<LI>New studies should ensure that they report all outcomes across randomized groups, so that all of the intervention effects can be considered. This should accompany comparisons between successful and unsuccessful reducers, as this will help to explore the role of smoking reduction in mediating any effects of harm reduction interventions on cessation.</LI>

<P>1. Reduction &amp; adherence (full intervention): 8 wks free supply of NRT (gum or patch according to participant preference).Counselling in smoking reduction and adherence to NRT given.

A participant-centred intervention utilizing motivational interviewing techniques and the 5R approach (relevance, risk, rewards, roadblocks and repetition) was used to boost motivation. The 3-min ADIN adherence counselling was developed from the guidelines on adherence interventions by the World Health Organization, which emphasizes the importance of adherence to prescribed NRT dosage in the treatment of tobacco dependence, advantages of adherence and disadvantages of non-adherence, assessment and discussion of the ways to overcome barriers and a problem-orientated approach to improving adherence.

<P>1. Varenicline: participants provided with varenicline for 2 - 8 wks - 1 pill/day (0.5 mg/day) for the first 3 days, then 2 pills/day (0.5 mg each) for 4 days, and then 2 pills/day (1.0 mg each) for the remainder of treatment. The clinician stated participants should take the medication for at least 2 weeks unless they had significant side effects, and they were encouraged to use it for up to 8 weeks. Brief counselling about reduction was given at baseline, 2, 4 and 8 wks. Participants were told varenicline would help them to reduce CPD, but it is unclear whether reducing improves health. At wk 2 they were encouraged to reduce CPD for the next 2 wks; however the clinician encouraged smoking reduction only to a degree that did not cause significant craving or withdrawal. If they agreed the clinician discussed 2 reduction methods: (a) systematically increasing the minimum amount of time between cigarettes, and (b) rank-ordering cigarettes from easiest to give up to hardest and systematically foregoing easiest to hardest cigarettes. The clinician suggested the participant set a very achievable initial goal (e.g. reduce by 5 cigarettes over the next 2 wks) to increase the chances of initial success. At all sessions, participants were asked if they had made a quit attempt since the last session but were never explicitly advised to quit. At the 4-wk visit, the clinician. encouraged smokers to either maintain that level of smoking, or set a new reduction goal. At the last visit at 8 wks, the clinician reminded participants that they would not be provided with further medication unless they set a quit date in the next 2 wks. If during any visit, participants stated they planned to try to stop smoking or had recently quit and were still abstinent, the session did not focus on reduction but rather on methods to prepare for or maintain abstinence.</P>

<P>1. Snus: participants were provided with snus throughout the 48-wk study period. The snus was manufactured by Swedish Match AB according to the GothiaTek standard. Participants could choose from 2 different sachet sizes (0.5 g and 1 g) and 2 different flavours (liquorice and eucalyptus). Whenever they felt an urge to smoke, participants were instructed to take a sachet of their allocated product. The number of sachets consumed each day was determined by the participants themselves. There was no prescribed tapering of product usage. Potential participants were invited to seminars on the health risks associated with smoking and available smoking cessation strategies. The physiological effects of nicotine were outlined, and an account given of the Swedish experience with snus including potential health risks associated with smokeless tobacco products. Participants were instructed to cut down on smoking as much as possible or quit smoking completely by replacing as many cigarettes as possible with their allocated study product. Those who managed to achieve the protocol definition of a substantial smoking reduction at the wk 24 visit or who had quit completely, continued in the trial up to 48 wks. During wks 25 - 48 they were actively instructed to quit smoking completely. Participants who did not meet the protocol criteria for smoking reduction at the wk-24 visit were counted as treatment failures in all efficacy analyses and were not actively followed after wk 24</P>
