<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Gaucher disease is an inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This leads to storage of complex lipids in some types of blood cells. Due to these abnormal cells people with Gaucher disease will have pain, fatigue, anemia, jaundice and bone damage. Some forms of Gaucher disease may also cause neurological damage. The treatment of Gaucher disease at present is mainly by enzyme replacement therapy which is expensive. In some severe cases HSCT is used to treat people with Gaucher disease. This is a high risk procedure sometimes leading to death of the individual.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and characterised by the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the lysosomes due to a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (lysosomal acid &#946;-glucosidase) (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2001</LINK>). The glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) has been mapped to chromosome one, band q21. More than 200 disease-causing mutations have been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Jmoudiak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jmoudiak 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The incidence of Gaucher disease in the general population is less than 1 in 30,000 to 40,000. It is more prevalent in people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent with a prevalence of 1 in 1000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 14 people (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2006</LINK>). Classically three types of Gaucher disease have been identified based on the presence or absence of primary central nervous system involvement and the severity of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-neuronopathic form</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Type 1 Gaucher disease</HEADING>
<P>This is the most common form accounting for 90 to 95 per cent of the cases. It is characterised by onset in adulthood and by the absence of primary central nervous system involvement. However, some individuals, who have severe mutations, present with an onset in early childhood.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neuronopathic forms</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Type 2 Gaucher disease</HEADING>
<P>This is characterised by severe neurological involvement and an onset during infancy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Type 3 Gaucher disease</HEADING>
<P>This is characterised by the onset of neurological disturbances in the first decade of life.</P>
<P>Types 2 and 3 are very rare and occur in less than 1 in 100,000 of the population. The prototype of type 3 Gaucher disease is found with high frequency in the Norbottnian population of northern Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The pathophysiological feature of Gaucher disease is the presence of Gaucher cells derived from the monocyte-macrophage system. Gaucher cells are present throughout the body, but the largest numbers are found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes causing enlargement and dysfunction of these organs resulting in clinical manifestations. Typically the infant is normal at birth, with clinical features only becoming apparent as the abnormal substrate accumulates. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia and hepatosplenomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the liver and spleen) are the common early features. Bone involvement is common but is not always associated with symptoms. The symptoms of bone disease range from mild pain to severe bone crises. Growth retardation is seen in moderate to severe forms of disease. The neurological symptoms seen in types 2 and 3 include oculomotor apraxia (difficulty moving the eyes), opisthotonus (extreme backward arching of the spine), bulbar signs (problems with breathing, swallowing and talking) and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2006</LINK>). Type 1 Gaucher disease has a broad spectrum of severity ranging from individuals who have been diagnosed in their eighth or ninth decade to children who die of complications during their first or second decade. Most infants with type 2 disease die within the first two years of life; and the severity of type 3 is intermediate between types 1 and 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2001</LINK>). A confirmed diagnosis can be made by measuring the glucocerebrosidase activity of peripheral blood leucocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts. Alternatively DNA analysis can be used to diagnose Gaucher disease and also to establish a disease prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The treatment of Gaucher disease before the 1990s was essentially symptomatic. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised the treatment approach to this disorder. Human placental &#946;-glucocerebrosidase was modified to expose variable numbers of mannose residues, so that it can be targeted to the macrophages (<LINK REF="REF-Danuta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danuta 1995</LINK>). This is the preferred form of treatment for symptomatic individuals with type 1 disease. Treatment results in significant regression of disease in these individuals and has very few side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Morales-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 1996</LINK>). The main drawbacks of ERT are that weekly infusions of the enzyme are required, and the treatment is very expensive. The cost of therapy for a child weighing 50 kg (at a dose of 130 units per kg per month) is approximately USD 300,000 per year for the medication alone (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 2005</LINK>). Moreover, the enzyme does not cross the blood brain barrier so it cannot be effective in types 2 and 3 diseases to improve neurological symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Erikson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erikson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zimran-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimran 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the pathophysiology of Gaucher disease is due to accumulation of lipid laden macrophages, bone marrow transplantation was thought of as a logical treatment for the disease. The first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was done in the 1980s. The individual died due to sepsis but had shown regression of disease manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Rappeport-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappeport 1984</LINK>). Since then many people have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (<LINK REF="REF-August-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">August 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringden-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringden 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringden-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svennerholm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svennerholm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1992</LINK>). Initially the HSCT was performed using donor bone marrow from siblings with an identical tissue type. With major improvements in the various areas of transplantation, the choice of donor cells has now expanded to include peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilised into the blood of the donor using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), marrow from matched or mismatched family members or unrelated donors and cord blood from siblings and unrelated babies. There is also increasing use of haploidentical tissue from parents.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes of HSCT are affected by numerous aspects of the transplant such as donor enzyme level, degree and persistence of donor chimerism, and post-transplant complications (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2005</LINK>). Benefit of transplantation varies between organ systems. Hematological and physical improvement is rapid and sustained. Reticuloendothelial organs, such as the liver and spleen regress within a few months (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2003</LINK>) and there is evidence that most of the skeletal changes seen in Gaucher disease regress (<LINK REF="REF-Starer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starer 1987</LINK>). The evidence on the beneficial effect of bone marrow transplantation on the regression of the neurological disease in people with types 2 and 3 is conflicting (<LINK REF="REF-Ringden-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringden 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svennerholm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svennerholm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1992</LINK>). The response is slow and the effectiveness appears to depend on the age of the individual, severity of the disease and its progression at the time of treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Newer modes of Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Besides ERT and HSCT there are a few other promising treatments. A recently introduced therapy is substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Miglustat (Zavesca, N-butyl deoxynojirimycin, OGT 918) has been licensed for the treatment of Gaucher disease in those who are not able to receive ERT. This compound inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, preventing new synthesis of glucosylceramide. The clinical trials show it is effective in most people with mild and stable disease, but is less well-tolerated. The drug crosses the blood brain barrier, and its effectiveness in the treatment of the types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease is under investigation. A new generation of therapeutic recombinant enzymes is under development which has an in-frame fusion to HIV-1 trans-activator protein transduction domain (TAT). The TAT modification improves the delivery of the enzyme to cells without mannose -specific endocytic receptors on the plasma membrane. Another option is the use of more specific small molecules that inhibit substrate synthesis (substrate deprivation), or act as chaperones to increase the activity of the enzyme (enzyme enhancement therapy). Various gene transfer methods are also in different trial phases (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>HSCT is a less expensive procedure that offers the potential of permanent cure when compared to other conservative measures now in use (ERT, SRT). However, the procedure is associated with a mortality ranging from less than 5% to more than 10% depending on the availability of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling and the source of the stem cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2007</LINK>). The mortality is expected to be higher in the severely compromised individuals with Gaucher disease. The choice between HSCT and conservative measures to treat people with Gaucher disease depends on the assessment of the long-term benefits of HSCT over the significant mortality and morbidity associated with the procedure. Another issue to be resolved in this area is whether HSCT can correct metabolic abnormalities of the central nervous system in individuals with type 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. This is an updated version of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Somaraju-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somaraju 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Somaraju-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somaraju 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Somaraju-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somaraju 2012</LINK>).</P>

For continuous outcomes we plan to record either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or post-intervention values and standard deviation. If standard errors are reported (and if possible) we plan to convert these to standard deviations. We plan to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 12:34:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We have not found any relevant RCTs, quasi-RCTs or CCTs assessing the role of HSCT for treating Gaucher disease.</P>
<P>At present HSCT is a treatment that can provide a permanent source of enzyme to people with Gaucher disease and is a considerably less expensive procedure when compared to the more commonly used intervention, ERT. A number of case-series reports have shown that, where engraftment takes place, HSCT leads to a favorable clinical outcome with a growth spurt, reversal of organomegaly, and a possible regression of skeletal changes. People with type 3 Gaucher disease showed no further neurological deterioration. One non-randomised study has suggested that HSCT may be more effective than ERT at currently used dosage levels, in reducing total body stores of glucocerebroside (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the important limitations of HSCT are the mortality and morbidity associated with the procedure and the non-availability of HLA-matched donors. For these reasons HSCT is postponed as a treatment until very late in the course of disease, when a cure is less likely. But the recent technological advances in the field of transplantation have expanded the sources of stem cells and also reduced the risks associated with the procedure. It is therefore important to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of HSCT in comparison with the more conservative but noncurative options such as ERT and substrate reduction therapy in the treatment of people with Gaucher disease. Until adequate data from appropriate clinical trials become available, clinicians will need to balance the possible benefits against the possible risks of transplantation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-09-18 12:35:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on the efficacy of hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were identified for inclusion in the review. The research evidence on which to base clinical decisions is limited to case reports. Given that there are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to January 2017 we do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.<BR/>

<P>No RCTs, quasi-RCTs or CCTs on the efficacy of HSCT were identified for inclusion in the review. There is a need for a well-designed RCT to evaluate the benefits and risks of HSCT in comparison to other prevalent forms of treatment in people with Gaucher disease.</P>
