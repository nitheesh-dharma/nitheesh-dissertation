<P>Not enough evidence to prove the benefit of a specific set of criteria to self-diagnose active labour.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is difficult to tell when active labour has begun. A false diagnosis can mean multiple visits to the hospital, frustration and discomfort for the mother, decreased confidence in caregivers and additional financial burdens. Antenatal education of women has been developed to increase their confidence and decrease their anxiety. Providing a specific set of criteria to women may be an effective way of helping them recognise the onset of active labour. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show whether specific criteria are more beneficial than general guidelines in helping women determine their stage of labour.</P>

<P>One study involving 245 women was included. Method of randomisation was unclear and 15% of the sample was lost to follow up in this trial.

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-06 10:59:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Timely diagnosis of active or progressive labour is problematic for caregivers and expectant women. The erroneous diagnosis of active labour may lead to a subsequent diagnosis of labour dystocia, the treatments for which are associated with risks for a mother and her infant (<LINK REF="REF-Thornton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 1994</LINK>). Mothers' confidence in their caregivers may be undermined and perceptions of the birth experience negatively affected when an incorrect labour diagnosis is amended (<LINK REF="REF-Simkin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 1996</LINK>). There may be additional financial burdens placed on facilities resulting from repeated assessment of women's labour status over multiple visits. These potential costs to women, their infants, and to health care may be avoided if admission to hospital for labour care occurs when active labour is established (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1989</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Providing information for pregnant women and their families about labour diagnosis may be a means of enabling women to recognise active labour, and to cope with their contractions with confidence. Potential benefits include enhancing women's feelings of control and empowerment, while providing an opportunity for educators to correct inaccurate information. The number of erroneous labour diagnoses may possibly be reduced by enabling women to remain out of hospital until active labour is likely to have become established. A multitude of educational resources have been developed for pregnant women, the quality of which vary greatly. Commonly it is physicians, midwives or antenatal educators who provide information on the recognition of labour onset.</P>
<P>A specific program designed to teach women to recognise active labour may be beneficial through potentially decreasing the incidence of early admission to hospital, increasing women's confidence and feelings of control and empowerment, and decreasing their anxiety. The aim of this review is to determine the effects of teaching pregnant women a specific set of criteria for diagnosing the onset of active labour. Related reviews focus on the effectiveness of the application of strict criteria for labour diagnosis by caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Lauzon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauzon 2001</LINK>), and on the effectiveness of individual or group antenatal education for childbirth/parenthood (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnon 2007</LINK>).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>
<I>See</I> table of 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>The trial compared a structured antenatal education intervention for the identification of symptoms for self-diagnosis of active labour, with no specific education, in an urban community hospital in the United States. Study participants were predominantly low-income single African-American women.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the single trial included in this review, the method of randomisation is unclear and 15% of the sample was lost to follow up.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The study by Bonovich (<LINK REF="STD-Bonovich-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bonovich 1990</LINK>) demonstrated that a specific antenatal education program was effective in reducing the mean number of visits to the labour suite before the onset of active labour (experimental group mean 0.29 (standard deviation (SD) 0.59), control group mean 0.58 (SD 0.72); weighted mean difference -0.29, 95% confidence interval -0.47 to -0.11). It is unclear, however, whether this intervention resulted in fewer women being sent home because they were not in labour.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The method of randomisation is unclear in the single trial included in this review, and so results must be considered with some caution. Attempts to contact the principal investigator for the purposes of clarification thus far have been unsuccessful.</P>
<P>This type of outcome measurement reporting is of limited clinical value. There is no conclusive evidence of benefit for teaching women a specific antenatal education program for self-diagnosis of active labour at present. Additionally, there is limited generalisability of results as the women participating were primarily single, low-income, urban African-Americans, in one hospital-based clinic in the US.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No implications for practice are warranted in light of the small amount of available evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Most women receive some instruction or advice regarding the signs and symptoms of labour. Whether women would benefit from learning a specific set of criteria for self-diagnosis of active labour remains unclear. Understanding potential effects on outcomes such as patient satisfaction and empowerment may be enhanced through qualitative methods. Until these are better understood, it is questionable whether the potential risks and benefits of a structured educational program are of sufficient importance to warrant a large clinical trial.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Method of randomisation is unclear: 'study numbers were sequentially assigned and used to randomise subjects to the experimental or control group'.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>245 nulliparous women &gt; 16 years of age at 30+ weeks' gestation who were able to communicate effectively in English, at a single US hospital-based outpatient obstetrical clinic. 37 (15%) were lost to follow up, due to incomplete hospital records or admission to hospital for complications before the onset of normal full-term labour.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>When participants had reached 37 weeks' gestation, interviews were conducted with the investigator to determine knowledge gained from family and friends regarding labour onset. Correct information was positively reinforced. Specific teaching re: palpation of uterine fundus, differentiation between Braxton-Hicks and active labour contractions, timing of contractions, recognition of amniotic fluid, and pain perception. Teaching was reinforced at subsequent weekly antenatal visits.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Mean number of visits to labour suite before onset of active labour (i.e. discharged undelivered).</P>
