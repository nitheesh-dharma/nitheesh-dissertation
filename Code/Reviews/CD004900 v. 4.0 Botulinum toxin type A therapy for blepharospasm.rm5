<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Botulinum toxin type A local injection therapy for blepharospasm or involuntary eyelid closure</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Blepharospasm is a dysfunction of the eyelids showing as involuntary eyelid closure due to spasmodic contractions of eye muscles. Other facial and neck muscles are also frequently involved. It often begins late in life with the severity ranging from repeated frequent blinking of both eyelids to persistent forceful closure and functional blindness. Treatment has included surgery, psychological approaches, biofeedback and drugs. Botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is the current treatment. No randomised controlled trials with sufficient numbers of patients fitted the review criteria. Trials identified found BtA to be superior to placebo as did large case-control and cohort studies, with around 90% of patients benefiting. The most common adverse effects affected the eyes and were short lived.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by chronic intermittent or persistent involuntary eyelid closure due to spasmodic contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Other facial and neck muscles are also frequently involved. Most cases are idiopathic and blepharospasm is generally a life-long disorder. Its severity can range from repeated frequent blinking to persistent forceful closure of the eyelids with functional blindness. Botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is the current first line therapy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether botulinum toxin (BtA) is an effective and safe treatment for blepharospasm.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We identified studies for inclusion in the review using the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, handsearches of the Movement Disorders Journal and abstracts of international congresses on movement disorders and botulinum toxin, communication with other researchers in the field, reference lists of papers found using above search strategies, and contact with authors and drug manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if they evaluated the efficacy of BtA for the treatment of blepharospasm. They must have been randomised and placebo-controlled.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We used a paper pro-forma to collect data from the included studies using double extraction by two independent reviewers. The two reviewers separately assessed each trial for internal validity and they settled differences between them by discussion. <BR/>The outcome measures used included adverse events, improvement in symptomatic rating scales, subjective evaluation by patients and clinicians, and changes in quality of life assessments.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found few controlled trials. They were of short duration and enrolled small numbers of patients. Because of their poor internal validity, the characteristics of the populations studied, and the types of interventions and outcomes, none of the trials fitted our criteria for inclusion. However, all these trials found BtA to be superior to placebo as did large case-control and cohort studies, which reported that around 90% of patients benefited.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are no high quality, randomised, controlled efficacy data to support the use of Bt for blepharospasm. Despite this, other studies suggest that BtA is highly effective and safe for treating blepharospasm and support its use. <BR/>The effect size (90% of patients benefit) seen in open studies makes it very difficult and probably unethical to perform new placebo-controlled trials of efficacy of BtA for blepharospasm. <BR/>Future trials should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals, different injection techniques, doses, Bt types and formulations. Other issues include service delivery, quality of life, long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by chronic intermittent or persistent involuntary eyelid closure (<LINK REF="REF-Meige-1910" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meige 1910</LINK>) due to spasmodic contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Berardelli-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berardelli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elston-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elston 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grandas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsden-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsden 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tolosa-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolosa 1988</LINK>). Sometimes there is additional involuntary inhibition of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Aramideh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aramideh 1994</LINK>). The term 'essential blepharospasm' is used to describe involuntary contractions involving only the orbital and periorbital muscles. However, many patients also have spasms of other facial, oromandibular, pharyngeal, laryngeal, or cervical muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Tolosa-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolosa 1979</LINK>). When adjacent body regions are involved this form of segmental dystonia is referred to as cranial-cervical dystonia. <BR/>Neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis that blepharospasm is due to hyperexcitability of brainstem interneurons as a result of organic dysfunction of the basal ganglia (<LINK REF="REF-Grandas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grandas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandas 1998</LINK>). <BR/>The vast majority of cases are idiopathic. Exposure to neuroleptics is a known risk factor for dystonia and blepharospasm. Rarely, lesions in the basal ganglia and upper midbrain (eg, with stroke, multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus) have been associated with blepharospasm. Cranial-cervical dystonia can also occur in association with other diseases of the central nervous system such as Wilson's disease, Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Cardoso-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardoso 1995</LINK>). <BR/>The prevalence of blepharospasm is estimated to be 5 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Grandas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nutt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nutt 1988</LINK>). It usually begins late in life, during the fifth or sixth decade, and affects women more often than men (<LINK REF="REF-Frueh-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frueh 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grandas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsden-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsden 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tolosa-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolosa 1981</LINK>). <BR/>Typically to start with there is increased frequency of blinking to a variety of stimuli such as air pollution, bright light and stress. It progresses to chronic involuntary bilateral spasm involving both eyes (<LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1982b</LINK>) synchronously. Its severity can range from repeated frequent blinking to persistent spasmodic closure of the eyelids leading to functional blindness with severe private and professional disability (<LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tucha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucha 2001</LINK>). <BR/>For decades the treatment options for this movement disorder included surgical techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Gillum-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillum 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1967</LINK>), psychological approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reckless-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reckless 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wickramasekera-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickramasekera 1974</LINK>), electromyographic biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brantley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brantley 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peck-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowan 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1976</LINK>) and drugs such as tetrabenazine (<LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1982a</LINK>), clonazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Merikangas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merikangas 1979</LINK>) and trihexyphenidyl (<LINK REF="REF-Brantley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brantley 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jankovic-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankovic 1983</LINK>). These approaches have been generally unsuccessful and few interventions have been studied in randomised controlled trials. <BR/>Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a natural product synthesised by an anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium botulinum. It is responsible for the food poisoning disease botulism. Different strains of Clostridium botulinum produce seven immunologically distinct forms of botulinum neurotoxin, labelled BtA to BtG. These potent neurotoxins are metalloproteases that block the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction though the cleavage of different peptide bonds that are crucial components in synaptic vesicle membrane fusion. The resulting impairment of neuromuscular transmission causes a flaccid paralysis (<LINK REF="REF-Brin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brin 2002</LINK>). <BR/>Clinical use of BtA began in the early 1980s and blepharospasm was the first focal dystonia to be treated with BtA (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1985</LINK>). Since the early 1990s it has been the treatment of choice for blepharospasm. <BR/>This systematic review aimed to clarify how much benefit patients with idiopathic blepharospasm derived from BtA and its safety profile.</P>

<P>The review drew on the search strategy developed for the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group as a whole. We conducted searches from 1977, which was the first year that Bt was used therapeutically. We identified relevant trials from the following sources:</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy to identify potentially suitable trials for the review according to the criteria outlined above. They resolved disagreements about inclusion by discussion. <BR/>Reviewers independently assessed the full papers for methodological quality by extracting details of randomisation methods, blinding of treatments and assessments, whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, whether treatment groups were comparable with regard to demographics and clinical characteristics, the number of patients excluded or lost to follow up, definition of outcomes, and entry and exclusion criteria. <BR/>Sources of bias were looked for including: 1) selection bias, including randomisation and by chance differences in groups due to small sample sizes; 2) performance bias; 3) attrition bias; 4) detection bias; 5) selective reporting of results. </P>
<P>The reviewers noted compliance, dropouts and other exclusions from analysis. They classified the analysis of trials as being on the basis of intention-to-treat, or not. <BR/>Two reviewers independently abstracted eligible data onto standardised forms, crosschecked for accuracy and amalgamated them. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. <BR/>All results were expressed as ordinal data. The various rating scales used were dichotomised using each study's own criteria for improvement or no improvement. If these criteria were not described we defined 'improvement' as any beneficial change from baseline and 'no improvement' as no improvement from baseline. We included any deterioration from baseline. In order to dichotomise the results we requested individual patient data if the results were presented as mean values for groups. </P>
<P>We performed statistical analyses using the statistical software provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. We tested heterogeneity between trial results using a standard chi-squared test. We reported the results as odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for dichotomous outcomes and as weighted mean difference (and 95% confidence intervals) for continuous outcomes, using the Peto fixed-effects method. We calculated the significance of any differences between odds ratios using a standard method (Altman). Where we could not combine outcome data from different studies we give a descriptive summary of the results.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We have not identified any suitable study to include in this systematic review. We found few controlled trials that were excluded mainly because of methodological problems and/or the type of patients included. Nonetheless, we describe these controlled studies and the reason for exclusion as follows. <BR/>The first controlled study was performed in 1985 (<LINK REF="STD-Fahn-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fahn 1985</LINK>). This was a double-blind study that enrolled eight patients with blepharospasm. Intraindividual 'other eye' controls were used meaning that a patient received BtA (Botox(r) 10 Units per eye) in one eye and placebo (saline) in the other eye. The primary outcome was an electrophysiological measurement of impairment and not clinical benefit. <BR/>Jankovic performed a study, which was fully published twice (<LINK REF="STD-Jankovic-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jankovic 1987</LINK>), comparing BtA with placebo in patients with cranial-cervical dystonia. The randomized double-blind trial included 12 patients with blepharospasm (nine with additional involuntary movements of the face or neck, such as Meige's syndrome, anterocollis, spasmodic dysphonia) who were randomly allocated by a toss of a coin to BtA or placebo. If the initial injection (either 25 Units per eye of BtA (Botox(r)) or placebo) was ineffective, the same material was injected 1 month later using a double dose. If the second injection produced no improvement, the patient was crossed over to the alternative treatment (third injection). The code was broken after this last injection and patients could continue to receive treatment in an open trial. Outcomes included subjective improvement (patient diary card and physician scale), objective improvement (video recordings), duration of effect (diary cards), and adverse events. It was unclear which was considered the primary outcome. Of the 12 patients, 4 received placebo without improvement and 11 received BtA with 72% improvement over baseline on the severity rating score, 61% on the self-assessment score, and 29% on the videotape score. Compared with their individual baseline disability score, these patients had a mean peak effect at 3.7 days and a mean duration of improvement of 12.5 weeks. Six of eleven (6/11) patients had blurred vision, five tearing, three bruising, two ptosis and one had diplopia after BtA injection. One of four (1/4) patients had bruising after placebo injections. </P>
<P>Frueh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Frueh-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Frueh 1988</LINK>) enrolled 26 patients with essential blepharospasm in a randomized, double-blind trial comparing BtA (Botox(r)) or placebo. Only 5 patients were BtA naïve. All patients received BtA in the upper eyelids and only the lower eyelids were randomized to BtA or placebo. The primary outcome was unclear. It was probably the patient's subjective opinion about spasm relief. It was not possible to compare active versus placebo activity. </P>
<P>Another 'controlled' study was reported by Park (<LINK REF="STD-Park-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Park 1993</LINK>). In reality this was a prospective case series of 101 patients with hemifacial spasm. It was not clear whether any of the patients had previously received BtA. The protocol did include a randomized double-blind phase but only four patients with blepharospasm were enrolled in this controlled phase. The report gave no clear data comparing the BtA and placebo groups containing these four patients and did not give the mean doses received during the blinded trial. <BR/>A further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Iwashige-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Iwashige 1995</LINK>) had assessed prospectively the effect of different BtA doses. However, it was an open study and did not include a placebo arm. <BR/>Girlanda (<LINK REF="STD-Girlanda-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Girlanda 1996</LINK>) enrolled six patients with blepharospasm in a trial comparing BtA (Botox(r)) and placebo. They did not report whether patients were randomized. All patients received BtA in one eye and placebo (saline) in the other eye. Neither the patients nor the assessors knew which eye was injected with BtA. The primary outcome was neurophysiological changes and this was not an efficacy study. <BR/>Two randomised, controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nussgens-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nussgens 1997</LINK>) compared different BtA formulations (Botox and Dysport) in patients with blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. No placebo group was included. </P>
<P>One randomised trial explored the effectiveness and side effects of four different BtA patterns of injections in 50 patients with blepharospasm (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1997</LINK>). The 'brow' treatment was as effective as 'standard' treatment, with fewer side effects. Other prospective, non-randomised studies have looked at the results of different patterns of BtA injections for blepharospasm, mainly the effect of pretarsal injection of BtA (<LINK REF="STD-Aramideh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aramideh 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jankovic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jankovic 1995</LINK>). Two trials compared the effects of BtA and Botulinum toxin type F (BtF) in blepharospasm. One of these trials was a double-blind, non-randomised study that enrolled nine patients who were injected with BtA on one side and with BtF on the other side (<LINK REF="STD-Mezaki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mezaki 1995</LINK>). The other trial was a randomised, double-blind trial enrolling 54 patients that received a mixture of BtA and BtF on one side, and BtA or BtF on the other side (<LINK REF="STD-Mezaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mezaki 1999</LINK>). However, these comparisons were outside the scope of our review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>BtA has been approved for the treatment of blepharospasm in the US and Europe since the early 1990s. The data available were considered sufficiently robust to support it as the treatment of choice for blepharospasm. However, we have found no high-quality randomised, controlled data. Open case-control studies have between them enrolled several thousand patients (<LINK REF="REF-Jost-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jost 2001</LINK>). In all these studies BtA was considered highly effective, with a success rate of approximately 90%. The mean duration of improvement ranged between 2 and 3.5 months. The most common adverse effects reported in these studies were: dry eye (7.5%), ptosis (2.8 to 12%), mild facial weakness (8.5%), and diplopia (1 to 13%). All of these adverse effects were local and transitory and there were no systemic adverse effects. </P>
<P>Bt therapy is probably the second most important discovery in movement disorder therapy after levodopa. Few drugs have such an obvious benefit as Bt has in some dystonias. The strength of this effect in blepharospasm has probably been responsible for the paucity of RCTs comparing BtA with placebo. Even though we do not have high quality, randomised, controlled data, indications are that BtA is indeed effective and safe in blepharospasm. </P>
<P>Do we need controlled data? We would not argue for new RCTs comparing Bt with placebo with the primary aim of proving its efficacy unless new formulations are under test. It is probably unethical to randomise patients to placebo or BtA for long-term RCTs studying efficacy and immunogenicity. However, comparisons of different treatment techniques, doses, Bt types and formulations, service delivery, and studies of its impact on quality of life might require RCTs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no high quality, randomised, controlled efficacy data to support the use of Bt for blepharospasm. Despite this, other studies suggest that BtA is highly effective and safe for treating blepharospasm and support its use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals, different injection techniques, doses, Bt types and formulations. Other issues include service delivery, quality of life measures, long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a double-blind study although it is not clear if it was randomised. It enrolled 8 patients with blepharospasm. Intra-individual 'other eye' controls were used meaning that a patient received BtA (Botox® 10 Units per eye) in one eye and placebo (saline) in the other eye. The primary outcome was an electrophysiological measurement of impairment, and not clinical benefit.</P>
