Thanks for careful job. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PJP 23 Aug 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;addressed MECIR check issues. while i have changed most as suggested this I am a little concerned about giving too much support to this drug. One the other hand,&lt;b&gt; studies and this review were not designed to address PDE4 i as add-on therapy&lt;/b&gt;. That was my interpretation as an example in Implications for Practice which is now picked up the GOLD guidelines.!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how to word it farily ??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the findings of this review give cautious support the use of PDE4 inhibitors in COPD. Their use may best be as add-on therapy in a subgroup of patients with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management. This is in accordance with the GOLD 2017 guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PJP 18 August 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the good feedback from the reviewer. I've added a paragraph to the background giving more information about exacerbations (along with 3 more refs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma J note to copyeditor 28/6/17: we know the Study IDs in this update do not conform to the Style Guide. Please leave these (as with previous versions of the review) as there are a number of unpublished studies, etc).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PJP and JC may 31st 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris, Liz and Emma. We have accepted nearly all the changes you made/ suggest. Please see our comments below in italics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa and Jimmy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC stats check May 5th 2017 (and June 16th all looks good now)!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have checked the FEV1 data that I can find in the papers and the 95% CI matches fine, so although this might look better as a GIV analysis, I can see that you have used the calculator to work back from the 95% CI so that is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it is time to remove the mean difference outcomes for exacerbations (1.18 &amp;amp; 1.20). This does not make any sense for skewed data. Instead please add &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Roflumilast ROF-MD-07(RE2SPOND)&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Roflumilast ROF-MD-07(RE2SPOND)&lt;/a&gt; as to &lt;a link_type=&quot;ANALYSIS&quot; href=&quot;001.18&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analysis 1.18&lt;/a&gt; from the rate ratio in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PP/JC yes we have done this (and the 95% CI matches the paper, thanks. CJC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also the 95% CI for &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;RO-2455-404-RD (REACT)&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;RO-2455-404-RD (REACT)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a link_type=&quot;ANALYSIS&quot; href=&quot;001.18&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analysis 1.18&lt;/a&gt; is narrower than that reported in the paper. The upper CI shows as 0.98 instead of 1.002 in the paper at the top of Table 2. What is the reason for this discrepancy please (what was your data source)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PP/JC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rate ratio for RE2SPOND is now included in 1.18&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rate ratio for REACT was a calculation error that we are grateful has been picked up. Where this has arisen is that JC took the SE in the greenbox as the error for the rate ratio, where instead it seems that this is the SE for the log[rate ratio]. Anyhow, whichever this is, the confidence intervals now agree with the one in the paper (see below)! thanks CJC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggest adding two Cates plots, one for people with one or more exacerbations and one for adverse events (to show the trade off clearly in absolute terms). I have put these in as figures for you and linked &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;03&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;04&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt; to the results in the text and to a comment in the SoF table. Obviously you are free to remove these if you do not think they are helpful! &lt;i&gt;PP/JC- looks good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition (based on the SoF tables and Cates plots) I have edited the abstract and PLS to give both relative and absolute effect sizes for exacerbations and diarrhoea. &lt;i&gt;PP/JC- looks good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also made some minor edits to the text and inserted links to the Figures in the results section too. &lt;i&gt;PP/JC- looks good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz notes 26/04/2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have updated search methods section to comply with updated Cochrane style guide, and moved search terms for the review to appendix. &lt;i&gt;PP/JC- looks good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma D notes 24/04/2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, well done for this update! I can see that you have by and large managed to slot in the data to this update without requiring a huge number of changes. The comments below relate to some discrepancies/errors arising from that, and a few other small issues to bring the review up to the Cochrane expectations for new reviews. Fine if you want to discuss whether everything is necessary, but we don't think it's going to take a huge amount of time to address everything as all comments are fairly minor, but we're leaving it all in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;number of studies in abstract and main text does not match. &lt;i&gt;PP studies now match &lt;/i&gt;Please double check all data in the abstract to be safe. &lt;i&gt;PP yes i have. Not sure we need all teh MD adn CI for all the GI side effects so have taken them out., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Background - update to latest guidelines throughout - you've done some and missed some. &lt;i&gt;PP hopefully all there now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Background, description of the intervention - add the names of the drugs e.g. roflumilast and cilomast. &lt;i&gt;PP there now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Included studies - normally this would be a synopsis of the characteristics which indicate applicability to the population e.g. the severity/baseline characteristics, and the interventions.&lt;i&gt; PP added a paragraph at the end of this section&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mention test for subgroup differences when discussing subgroups - Chris said to me he added a few of these. &lt;i&gt;PP added more &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The greatest change was seen with 15 mg of cilomilast twice daily in the six-week &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Compton 2001&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Compton 2001&lt;/a&gt; trial (MD -3.90; 95% CI -7.50 to -0.30), although this estimate had wide confidence intervals&amp;quot;. Does this really add anything useful?&lt;i&gt; PP deleted this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;analysis 1.21 - have picked out the significant result - but the diamond is significant - but is it clinically relevant? &lt;i&gt;PP this is now 1.19. MCID for Borg score is about 1 so i have added a sentence that this is of doubtul clincal significance &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of included studies - add funding source to notes section. There are some sources noted, but patchy. &lt;i&gt;PP it'd be big job to go back and do this &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;It is of concern that results seen in trials published in journals by pharmaceutical companies showed a greater benefit of these medicines than those which were unpublished.&amp;quot; we assume that this relates to the data from unpublished studies that has been found from the FDA website, but it would be good to make this clear. JC: &lt;i&gt;Actually this was from the GSK website so the comment here is more around unpublished data in general. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excluded studies - looks like 2 studies may have been excluded incorrectly - &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Song 2005&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Song 2005&lt;/a&gt; and Rennard 2008 - due to not providing SE or SD. These could have been requested from the authors. If decide not to include, could note as a limitation of the review instead (albeit one that might not have an impact on the conclusions). JC: &lt;i&gt;Song 2005 was published in abstract format only, with no full text avaiable after 2 updated searches and we have not been able to contact the authors. Rennard 2008 actually belongs to one of the other combined studies so this reference is now included under this. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please add sources of support - even if only your university/employer for giving some work time. Or state: The authors declare that no funding was received for this systematic review &lt;i&gt;PP couldn't see how to add this statement but added about uni salary &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 headings not activated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;other sources of bias - this would be the place to discuss the baseline imbalances included in your ROB tables &lt;i&gt;PP done this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;agreements and disagreement with other reviews and studies. An important discussion point to include. There is a discussion of White 2013 in the results which could be moved and perhaps expanded? Also some of the information from &amp;quot;summary of main results&amp;quot; belongs under this new heading. &lt;i&gt;PP made some changes and added refs to metaanalyses. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PRISMA diagram doesn't quite match the text - see my revisions. &lt;i&gt;PP/JC- looks good !&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideally the 75 studies excluded after reading the full text would have reasons for exclusion - but quite bit of work to go back and do this and for not much benefit- &lt;i&gt;PP/JC we agree, and do not want to go back and do this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Notes about previous updates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;CJC edits August 6th 2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;This is a good update. I have made some changes to wording in the abstract to add withdrawals and the new evidence on psychiatric problems. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I think this warranted a conclusions changed label, so have altered this.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;SoF altered to make clearer the direction of FEV1 and SGRQ.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I think imbalanced withdrawals is a possible source of bias here, and have mentioned this in discussion. Do you want to reflect this in the SoF tables? (Emma - if this applies across all domains, then you could add a footnote to the column heading and say that you are concerned about unbalanced withdrawal rates, but not sufficiently to warrant downgrading)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I think the funnel plot comments are fine, and the reporting of withheld data is balanced.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thanks,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma W: Abstract (July 2013)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please can you add the following&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Provide a brief description of key characteristics that will determine the applicability of a body of evidence (e.g. age, severity of condition, setting, study duration)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Provide a comment on the risk of bias&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Ensure that key findings are interpretable or are re-expressed in an interpretable way. For instance, they might be re-expressed in absolute terms (e.g. assumed and corresponding risks, NNTs, group means), and outcomes combined with a standard scale (e.g. SMD might be re-expressed in units that are more naturally understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-incorporate the GRADE summary of the evidence (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.78, x studies, x participants, high/moderate/low quality evidence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC can you please check SoF table regarding GRADE category rating. I have updated the abstracts accordingly to recommendations above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Liz S notes 3/7/2013&lt;/u&gt; I've had a go at putting together a PRISMA study flow diagram based on the text in the 'results of search' section. Please can you check it and make sure you're happy it reflects what you did? And also please can you complete the end box: &amp;quot;no. studies included in quantitative synthesis&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Cheers Liz, the prism diagram looks great. I&amp;#8217;ve taken out the last box as all included studies were used in the meta-analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma W notes 27/06/2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Jimmy, the update looks good. I think it is going to be the first update published from the list of reviews we prioritised, so I am very happy! I made a few edits for style, but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: I&amp;#8217;m glad we managed to make the update timely. It was good given there were a few loose ends from the first publication, so hopefully the review will stand for some time after it is published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, there are some new standards that we have to meet for new reviews, but which I would love to meet for all the updates too (it is surely only a matter of time before this becomes mandatory for updates and besides I want the Airways reviews to be among the best). If you would be willing to spare an afternoon, I think you can easily address these and meet all the standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main things are to add a couple of sentences to the abstract - what you need to add is highlighted in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the plain language summary, can you check the new standards for PLS here and re-write: standards here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: This was quite fun to write. Explaining in simple terms makes one really think about what the research tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many deactivated headings in the review - I activated them and cut and paste some of the text beneath where it was straight-forward to do this. I don't want to burden you with a lot of work unnecessarily, but it would be good if you would be able to go through and see if you can write something (or copy and paste something) under the headings. I feel a bit like I am interfering when I alter updates in this way, but because it's about having the reviews in the same format across the library to make it easier for readers to read and compare multiple reviews, I think it makes sense for me to help with this. I hope this is OK and has not altered the flow of your review, let me know if you are not happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Hopefully this will be suffice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added &lt;b&gt;What's new&lt;/b&gt; - please check. It is probably worth adding here and in the abstract that you included the FDA report on psychiatric AEs and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;risk of bias&lt;/b&gt; - you must write something in each box so that a dot appears in the ROB figure - can you go and do that where necessary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: I&amp;#8217;m understanding this as the risk of bias table where currently some headings are unclear. In these situations I have written &amp;#8220;not stated&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;methods&lt;/b&gt; - do you want to do a funnel plot to explore publication bias/small study effects? You have enough trials to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: if Chris has some time if would be really handy to get his opinion on the funnel plot. I&amp;#8217;m not fully clear on interpreting funnel plots as this is often a debated area. There is a brief statement describing our plot in the text but this is conservative. I have not included one for SQRQ data as we do not have enough studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I re-organised the forest plots so they are set up the recommended way (i.e. all under one comparison PDE4 vs placebo) - I also added the links to the new analyses. Once you check you are happy, either you or I can delete the other analyses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Thanks for doing the reorganising which must have been time consuming. It&amp;#8217;s a lot more easier to follow this way I&amp;#8217;ve removed the rest of the analyses. There were a couple old links which I changed (you did the majority), but just need to look out if there are any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;analysis 1.39 in the forest plot you presented subtotals only - but looks to me like you reported the pooled result in the text. Can you consider whether to either turn the pooled total on in the forest plot, or report the two subgroup results in the body of the review?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Prefer to do the later and have reported the subgroup total of the 250 ug dose in the review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emma J notes 25.6.13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Please could you insert the various 'dates accessed' (as per highlights)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The GOLD guidelines are referenced as 2005 &amp;amp; 2009 - these were updated Feb 2013 - please update if appropriate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC: I have updated the GOLD reference and mentioned guidelines in the text. This is mainly to do terminology changing GOLD stage to grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC revisited Jan 21st. Thanks to the authors for excellent revision. Ready for peer review. I have added the publication status as change from protocol but accept that it is not post hoc. Too much is unclear to do any subgrouping on study quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editorial Jan 7 2011 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors response Jan 18. Editors tracked changes have been accepted. New text changes are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Date of last search added to abstract. &amp;quot;Others came from the FDA trial web site and pharmaceutical companies.&amp;quot; Was this from trial registers on company web sites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noted: &amp;quot;Others came from web-based clinical trial registers&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not use the WMD abbreviation any more, just mean difference (MD). I have globally replaced WMD with MD in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roflumilast and cilomilast were each associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation (OR 0.78; 95%CI 0.72 to 0.85).&amp;quot; Is the OR for one or both of these results (each is confusing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarification provided: &amp;quot;Treatment with a PDE&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor was associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation (OR 0.78; 95%CI 0.72 to 0.85)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They may be of most use alongside combinations of long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids in people with severe disease and multiple exacerbations.&amp;quot; Can this conclusion be drawn for the data in the review, if not it should be withdrawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conclusion has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;New approaches to treatment are needed, as none of these slows the decline in lung function or enhances survival.&amp;quot; I do not think this is likely to be a true statement (TORCH suggests enhanced survival with combination treatment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement has been further explained: &amp;quot;In the TORCH study (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Calverley 2007&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Calverley 2007&lt;/a&gt;) a combination of salmeterol 50 &amp;#956;g and fluticasone 500 &amp;#956;g twice daily reduced the risk of death by 17% compared with placebo over the three-year trial period; however, this did not reach statistical significance&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not see any mention of published versus unpublished data in the protocol. We may have to call this post-hoc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct, as this was not mentioned in the protocol. A note has been added to the methods section as to why this is post-protocol. I would argue it is not post hoc, as we planned it before the analysis, once we found lots of unpublished studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of Bias: I do not see how baseline use of medication introduces BIAS into the studies. This is important but belongs in another Table I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics for concomitant medication have been moved under the description of the intervention provided for each study. Comparisons for baseline medication profile remains as this information may be important to highlight possible differences between treatment and control groups despite randomisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you asked GSK about the trials on their register - they could give details of methods used in these trials (that tend to be pretty standard).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has not been done at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It also showed that significant improvement in SGRQ total score was only seen in trials of cilomilast.&amp;quot; This is misleading and probably just due to more trials. There is no difference between the two drugs (point estimates very similar). You can do a formal test of interaction if you wish!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change accepted to remove this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There was a difference in effect size on total SQRQ score between published and unpublished trials with only the former statistically significant (MD -1.93; 95% CI -3.02 to -0.83 versus MD -0.43; 95% CI -1.26 to 0.40).&amp;quot; Again it is not valid just to compare P values. A proper test for interaction is required, but I am not sure this is sensible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*THIS IS UNDER HEADING OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree - not sensible to do the analysis. The aim of this section is explore differences in effect sizes, based on plausible reasons for possible differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of comparison between shorter and longer trials and I am not quite sure whether this should fit here in the results section. Perhaps it would be better to state what the results were and leave the comparisons (and unpicking of possible reasons for the differing treatments effects) for the discussion section?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DELETED this paragraph. It is covered in discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Please relabel roflumilast subgroup to show the first one is 500 mcg; presumably the trials in 500 and 250 were different patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relabelling changes made to subgroups for all analyses where appropriate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;quot;Similar efficacy was seen for both roflumilast and cilomilast, and whether or not subjects also received long acting bronchodilators&amp;quot; - did you do a subgroup analysis for this? Would that be helpful? Could you at least say what trials included bronchodilators and which did not here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half of this statement has been taken out, no further subgroup analyses performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Analysis 4.4. I'm not sure that it's appropriate to combine all these different scales? it feels like duplication of results to have comparison 4.4 when 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 display the same info. Why not just add a separate analysis for shortness of breath questionnaire and avoid the need to do SMD in analysis 4.4?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis 4.4 changed to shortness of breath only, and resultant txt modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggest separate headings for symptom score and exercise tolerance rather than analyses 4 and 5 which do not mean anything to readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headings have now been added to text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - ADverse events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Particular adverse effects reported only with cilomilast included vomiting&amp;quot; - the forest plot for vomiting includes a study with rofumilast so that sentence needs adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed to correct it and make it easier to read and understand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I think this sentence refers to analysis 6.2. &amp;quot;The lower dose of roflumilast was not associated with more adverse effect than placebo, however, this was based on only two trials and confidence intervals were wide (Analysis 6.1)&amp;quot; Please check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct, this should refer to Analysis 6.2. Main text has been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm not quite sure why the &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Compton 2001&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Compton 2001&lt;/a&gt; study is singled out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;because it was the only dose ranging study of cilomilast - txt amended&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The final sentence seems to come from comes from nowhere: &amp;quot;It should be noted that subjects who experienced a COPD exacerbation during the study period were counted as having had an adverse effect.&amp;quot; Would it be better placed in the discussion of 6.1/6.2 as presumably these are the only two forest plots affected by this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree and now appreas only in discussion. CHRIS clinically it is quite an odd things to do though, isn't it? Maybe I am too suspicious they were trying to reduce the differences in adverse effects to make treatment look better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There was heterogeneity among the trials of cilomilast but not roflumilast. There was also publication bias: the increase in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in published studies was approximately twice that seen in unpublished trials.&amp;quot; This is dangerous ground as there were lots of other differences between the trials. I think SHORT DURATION is key. The longer term results do not back up the optimistic findings of the early short duration trials? We cannot control for duration, dose and product to be sure whether this is actually publicaton bias or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better to say that the earlier short studies show more favourable results than the more recent, longer studies, many of which have not yet been published?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, text changed to tone this down a bit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &amp;quot;This review found that adverse effects were greater in the roflumilast and cilomilast treated subjects, particularly gastrointestinal-related effects such as diarrhoea and nausea, and headache.&amp;quot; - please clarify whether compared to placebo or other drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with placebo - clarification added to text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &amp;quot;It was notable that treatment with roflumilast was associated with a significant chance of weight loss&amp;quot; Whereas the other PDE4 inhibitors did not? Please clarify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the fact that there have been no trials of cilomilast than measured wt loss is mentioned in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The findings of this review support the notion of PDE&lt;sub&gt;4 &lt;/sub&gt;inhibitors working in addition to long-acting bronchodilators, with their effect possibly attenuated if patients are already on ICS. These support their having an anti-inflammatory effect, rather than a purely bronchodilatory effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of evidence of disease modification, their role might be best in patients with more severe COPD with frequent exacerbations who are on maximal therapy, or if ICS are not used for whatever reason. If they are used, weight should be monitored.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are speculative conclusions that do not come from the data found in the review so I have removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- There should be a space between numerals and units e.g. 500 mcg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amended&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- It really helps to link the analyses to the text using the link tool. Not only does this update if you change the order of the forest plots, it allows readers to easily see the analyses in question - I have added quite a few, but please add where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amended where possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I have deleted the grades from the discussion of quality of evidence as this is no longer recommended by the Handbook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed analysis 2.5 (quliaty on SGRQ) left the one for FEV1. CHRIS I am not sure how to draw conclusions about study quality, given so much of it was unclear. The trials overall seem to be reasonably well conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You referred to analysis 1.8 for FVC when you meant 1.9 - I changed this, but could you just check pleasE? ditto 1.9 changed to 1.10 for PEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've made a small change to the inverse variance calculation (exacerbation rate analysis 3.3) - removed the obsolete study and used the same number of decimal points in M2-124 and M2-125 to promote consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:30 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="PDE-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>
<B>Background of the review</B>
</P>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition caused by damage from harmful chemicals that are breathed in and is predominantly seen in people who smoke tobacco. These chemicals set up a cascade of inflammatory reactions, which damage structures in the lung but also increase mucus production in the airways. These processes lead to intermittent symptoms of breathlessness and decreased capacity to perform day-to-day tasks. In addition, people with COPD are at greater risk of developing exacerbations ('flare ups'), which become more frequent and severe over time. People vary in terms of how they are affected by COPD. This is in part related to the severity of the disease but also to differences in response to medicines, an individual's fitness and coexistent conditions. The only way to prevent further lung damage in most people is to stop smoking.</P>
<P>Medicines prescribed to manage COPD generally aim to improve symptoms, reduce exacerbations or both. In the early stages, bronchodilator medicines are helpful because these relax the small muscles in the airway allowing more air to move freely in and out of the lungs. Some long-acting agents may reduce exacerbations. Steroid-containing inhalers may be added specifically to target inflammation in the lungs and thus modestly reduce the number of exacerbations.</P>
<P>Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE<SUB>4</SUB>) inhibitors are a relatively new class of medicines that have been marketed to improve COPD. They have both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, the two currently available medicines, roflumilast and cilomilast, are taken as a tablet. Our review collated and analysed existing trials to define the benefits and risks of PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors in COPD.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we look at?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 34 completed trials involving 24,084 adults, with results reported up to October 2016. These consisted mainly of trials in people with moderate to very severe disease who discontinued other regular COPD medications. However, there were seven trials that allowed continuation of usual COPD medicines. The trials ranged from 6 to 52 weeks' duration and the average age of participants was 64 years. The trials were all sponsored by the manufacturers of PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find out?</B>
</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, these medicines provide a small improvement in lung function measurements and reduce the likelihood of an exacerbation of COPD. Based on these results, we would expect that out of 100 people who took PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors every day for a year, 28 would experience at least one exacerbation which is five fewer than for others who did not receive these medicines.</P>
<P>However, people reported that these medicines only provided a small effect on levels of breathlessness and quality of life. Furthermore, around 5% to 10% of people in trials who received roflumilast or cilomilast reported side effects such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. We would expect that out of 100 people who took PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors every day for a year, 11 would experience diarrhoea, which is seven more than for others who did not receive these medicines. There was also a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of sleep or mood disturbance for the roflumilast 500 &#956;g dose, although overall the total number of reported incidents was still small. There was no effect on rates of hospitalisation and deaths. The effects were the same regardless of the severity of COPD, or whether other medicines for COPD were being taken.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The studies were generally well designed, as people did not know if they were receiving this new treatment or a placebo medicine. Overall we rated the evidence as being of moderate to high quality.</P>
<P>It is of concern that results seen in trials published in journals by pharmaceutical companies showed a greater benefit of these medicines than those which were unpublished. Therefore, this relies on unpublished trial data being made accessible and up to date. The psychiatric adverse effects data remain unpublished. Longer-term trials are necessary to get a more accurate estimate of the benefits and safety of these medicines over time, including whether they slow COPD disease progression.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with cough, sputum production or dyspnoea and a reduction in lung function, quality of life and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, there are no other treatments that slow lung function decline. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE<SUB>4</SUB>) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and updated in 2013. </P>

<P>One review author extracted data and a second review author checked the data.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Thirty-four separate RCTs studying roflumilast (20 trials with 17,627 participants) or cilomilast (14 trials with 6457 participants) met the inclusion criteria, with a duration of between six weeks and one year. These included people across international study centres with moderate to very severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II-IV), with a mean age of 64 years.</P>
<P>We considered that the methodological quality of the 34 published and unpublished trials was acceptable overall. Treatment with a PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor was associated with a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) over the trial period compared with placebo (MD 51.53 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 43.17 to 59.90, 27 trials with 20,585 participants, moderate-quality evidence due to moderate levels of heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias). There were small improvements in quality of life (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), MD -1.06 units, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43, 11 trials with 7645 participants, moderate-quality evidence due to moderate levels of heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias) and COPD-related symptoms, but no significant change in exercise tolerance. Treatment with a PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor was associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.83; 23 trials with 19,948 participants, high-quality evidence). For every 100 people treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors, five more remained exacerbation-free during the study period compared with placebo (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20, 95% CI 16 to 26). More participants in the treatment groups experienced non-serious adverse events compared with controls, particularly a range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or dyspepsia. For every 100 people treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors, seven more suffered from diarrhoea during the study period compared with placebo (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). Roflumilast in particular was associated with weight loss during the trial period and an increase in insomnia and depressive mood symptoms. There was no significant effect of treatment on non-fatal serious adverse events (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) or mortality (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23), although mortality was a rare event during the trials. Participants treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors were more likely to withdraw from the trials because of adverse effects; on average 14% in the treatment groups withdrew compared with 8% in the control groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-13 02:12:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In people with COPD, PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors offered benefit over placebo in improving lung function and reducing the likelihood of exacerbations; however, they had little impact on quality of life or symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss were common, and safety data submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have raised concerns over psychiatric adverse events with roflumilast. The findings of this review give cautious support to the use of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors in COPD. They may be best used as add-on therapy in a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management. This is in accordance with the GOLD 2017 guidelines. Longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors modify FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline, hospitalisation or mortality in COPD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality, resulting in a growing social and economic burden (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). In 2002, it was estimated to be the fifth leading cause of death, responsible for approximately 4.8% of total deaths worldwide and it is projected to rise to fourth position by the year 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This diagnosis of COPD by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>) says that it is a "common, preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases." COPD may be punctuated by periods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, called exacerbations. Besides exposures, host factors predispose individuals to develop COPD. Co-morbidities contribute to the overall severity and mortality in individual people. (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure to risk factors for this disease and symptoms of cough, sputum production or dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Spirometry is required for diagnosis, with airflow obstruction being confirmed by a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) of 0.7 or lower (<LINK REF="REF-Celli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2004</LINK>). Life expectancy is reduced in people diagnosed with COPD and, although prognosis is variable, age and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> are the strongest predictors of mortality.</P>
<P>The predominant risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking, with other environmental pollutants also known to contribute. Cigarette smoke leads to the activation of macrophages and CD8 T lymphocytes that release inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The process also involves neutrophil attraction and cell apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2000</LINK>). To date, smoking cessation is the only intervention known to slow the decline in lung function associated with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacotherapy is commonly used to treat people with COPD, with effects on symptoms, quality of life, or frequency and severity of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Celli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). Mainstays of treatment include short- and long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics, corticosteroids and methylxanthines. New approaches to treatment are needed, as no individual agent slows the decline in lung function or survival. In the TORCH study (<LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2007</LINK>) a combination of salmeterol 50 &#956;g and fluticasone 500 &#956;g twice daily reduced the risk of death by 17% compared with placebo over the three-year trial period; however, this did not reach the pre-defined level of statistical significance for the study.</P>
<P>An exacerbation of COPD is an acute and sustained increase in symptoms that result in additional therapy (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). The risk of exacerbation significantly increases in more severe COPD. Exacerbations have a negative impact on quality of life and lead to more rapid COPD progression, as well as higher health care utilisation and associated costs. Common triggers are respiratory viral infections, bacterial infections or air pollution (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>), which may lead to an increase in airway inflammation, production of mucus, acute deterioration in lung function, hyperinflation from gas trapping, or a combination of these symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Geffen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Geffen 2015</LINK>). These processes contribute to the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and cough, as well as to changes in the character or volume of sputum.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-13 02:22:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention is an oral medicine that is a selective inhibitor of the isoenzyme phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE<SUB>4</SUB>). This isoenzyme has a role in airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction, both of which are pathological features of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Boswell_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boswell-Smith 2006</LINK>). Two medicines in this class that have been studied are roflumilast and cilomilast.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) is a secondary messenger that suppresses the activity of inflammatory cells and mediates the process of smooth muscle relaxation in the airways. Phosphodiesterases, in turn, hydrolyse and turn off the biological activity of cAMP (<LINK REF="REF-Boswell_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boswell-Smith 2006</LINK>). Therefore, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase action should theoretically provide improvements in the extent of airway narrowing and damage from inflammation.</P>
<P>Non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as theophylline, a methylxanthine, have been used in the management of people with COPD for years. These are recommended by current international guidelines as part of adjunctive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). Limitations to their use include a narrow therapeutic margin, and the frequency of adverse effects, which may occur even when the plasma level is within the therapeutic range (<LINK REF="REF-Boswell_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boswell-Smith 2006</LINK>). Common adverse effects associated with theophylline include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia and gastrointestinal effects (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2003</LINK>). Less common, but more serious, are the increased risks of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2003</LINK>). Some of the adverse effects associated with theophylline have been attributed to its non-selective PDE inhibition and concurrent adenosine receptor antagonism (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The isoenzyme PDE<SUB>4</SUB> is the predominant isoenzyme involved with metabolising cAMP in immune and inflammatory immune cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and endothelial cells in COPD, in airway smooth muscle and pulmonary nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Agusti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agusti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boswell_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boswell-Smith 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torphy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torphy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vignola-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignola 2004</LINK>). Inhibition of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> leads to elevation of cAMP in inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells, resulting in suppression of inflammatory cell function, relaxation of airways smooth muscle and modulation of pulmonary nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Boswell_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boswell-Smith 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Essayan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essayan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torphy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torphy 1999</LINK>). Thus, PDE<SUB>4</SUB> is an attractive target for inhibition in COPD. Furthermore, the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular adverse effects experienced in patients treated with the non-selective PDE inhibitor, theophylline, are a result of adenosine receptor antagonism. This feature is not present with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> specific inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Vignola-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignola 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-23 14:32:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>The development of selective PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors offers new hope for therapy offering both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects in COPD, with fewer of the adverse effects encountered with non-selective inhibitors. Additionally, PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors may be easier to use because there is less pharmacokinetic variability and lower potential for drug interactions compared with theophylline (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2005</LINK>). Several PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors have been developed, with some progressing to phase III clinical trials. These include the second-generation PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors roflumilast (Nycomed, formerly Altana) and cilomilast (GlaxoSmithKline).</P>
<P>The 2017 GOLD guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>) state that roflumilast may be considered in patients on triple inhaled therapy who still have exacerbations, an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of less than 50% predicted and chronic bronchitis, especially if they have had a hospitalisation in the last year. </P>
<P>This review focuses on the effect of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors in the management of people with stable COPD, using clinically important outcomes. Collating this evidence into a systematic review allows an assessment as to whether or not the theoretical benefits of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors translate into useful clinical effects, and may suggest the potential place of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors within the increasing pharmacopoeia of COPD treatments.</P>

<P>We categorised references according to the trial name (by drug name and number, or by author and year). We obtained data on additional outcomes from other references to the same trial, and more detailed descriptions of study populations from information submitted by the drug manufacturer to the FDA website.</P>
<P>Where there were data from more than one report of the same trial, we considered the data from the primary published reference with the most complete data on the primary outcome(s) to take priority. For primary outcomes, we used intention-to-treat analysis in preference to per-protocol analysis.

<P>For the initial search in October 2006, we identified 477 abstracts of potentially relevant trials, which was narrowed to 71 abstracts using a less sensitive search of the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register. We searched again in 2008 and located 79 abstracts; in 2010 finding 17 abstracts; and in 2013, locating 20 abstracts. For the present update, the search found 55 abstracts (48 excluding duplicates). In total 648 records were identified from database screening. Many abstracts were reports of earlier trials. We decided whether or not to seek the full text based on a review of the abstract text, title and MeSH headings of all identified citations, with the numbers of full papers sought outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this update we sought full papers for 28 abstracts. For each update, two review authors (JC and PP) assessed the full-text versions of the trials to determine whether or not they met the inclusion criteria. We resolved any differences by discussion. We then assessed trials that met the inclusion criteria for methodological quality.</P>
<P>In addition, in the course of earlier updates we found 15 completed trials for roflumilast and one for cilomilast in participants with COPD in a search of the online clinical trials registry of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). After attempting to correlate each unique NIH study number with trials already identified in the above searches of the Airways registry, there were seven studies of roflumilast on the NIH clinical trials registry that had not been published elsewhere in any form. For the 2016 update, no new completed trials were located on the NIH websites that had not already been published.</P>
<P>For cilomilast, we identified one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Compton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Compton 2001</LINK>) from the literature search and obtained the full text. Further, we found a summary of the study design, along with a report of results, for 12 individual phase II or III trials on the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) website.</P>

<P>There were two trials reported only as conference posters: <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-FK1-101" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast FK1 101</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-FK1-103" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast FK1 103</LINK>.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Change in lung function from baseline</HEADING>
<P>Based on the 27 trials that reported this outcome, there was a statistically significant improvement in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>from baseline in the PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor-treated participants compared with controls (MD 51.53 mL, 95% CI 43.17 to 59.90, 20,585 participants), over the study period (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect on FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>was seen for roflumilast 500 g (MD 56.45 mL, 95% CI 48.01 to 64.89), roflumilast 250 g (MD 56.88 mL, 95% CI 24.38 to 89.38) and for cilomilast 15 mg twice daily (MD 41.03 mL ,95% CI 23.93 to 58.13). A moderate level of heterogeneity existed for this outcome (Chi = 56, df = 29, P = 0.002; I = 48%), which is only partially explained by investigating differences between roflumilast and cilomilast. This is discussed further in the sensitivity analysis below. Analysis of a dose effect was possible in three trials: <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-FK1-101" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast FK1 101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_107" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-107</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-IN_x002d_108" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast IN-108</LINK>. Roflumilast 500 &#956;g was associated with a greater change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than roflumilast 250 &#956;g, but this was not statistically significant (MD 22.61, 95% CI -5.95 to 51.16).</P>
<P>With respect to PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor use with concomitant therapies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), the largest increases in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>were seen in the two trials where participants were taking regular, long-acting bronchodilators: in one, salmeterol (<LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_127" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-127</LINK>) and in the other, tiotropium (<LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_128" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-128</LINK>) (overall MD 60.52 mL, 95% CI 40.57 to 80.46). The next largest improvements were seen in trials where all concomitant medications (including long-acting bronchodilators if previously received) were continued (<LINK REF="STD-RO_x002d_2455_x002d_301_x002d_RD-_x0028_ACROSS_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">RO-2455-301-RD (ACROSS)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RO_x002d_2455_x002d_404_x002d_RD-_x0028_REACT_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">RO-2455-404-RD (REACT)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-ROF_x002d_MD_x002d_07_x0028_RE2SPOND_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast ROF-MD-07(RE2SPOND)</LINK> (MD 56.58 mL, 95% CI 46.91 to 66.25).</P>
<P>Similar improvements were seen in trials where all medications apart from short-acting beta 2 agonists were stopped (MD 44.78 mL, 95% CI 37.67 to 51.90) and in the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_111" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-111</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_112" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-112</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_118" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-118</LINK>) where both treatment and control groups continued on an inhaled corticosteroid (MD 42.26 mL, 95% CI 25.46 to 59.05).</P>
<P>Treatment with a PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor was associated with a statistically greater change in FVC from baseline than placebo (MD 87.28 mL, 95% CI 74.87 to 99.70) with minimal heterogeneity among the 16 trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Change in PEF was measured in only five of the 34 trials, but was significantly higher with treatment than in controls (MD 6.54 L/min, 95% CI 3.95 to 9.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Note that with the SGRQ, a decrease in the total score represents an improvement in the quality of life. We noted a small but statistically significant decrease in total score on the SGRQ from baseline in participants treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors compared with those in the control groups (MD -1.06, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43, P = 0.0009) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). There was heterogeneity in this observation (Chi = 21, df = 11, P = 0.03, I = 47%).</P>
<P>It was notable that in the two trials with a duration of one year that reported total SGRQ, there was no significant change in quality of life seen with treatment compared with control (MD 0.26, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.69). We did not include outcome data for <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-M2_x002d_111" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast M2-111</LINK> as data were provided in the form of a 'repeated measures analysis' and pooled data did not equal the sum of numbers in each of the individual studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Use of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the numbers of participants experiencing one or more COPD exacerbations. This is a relative reduction of more than 20% (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.83) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>), from a representative risk of 33 per 100 on placebo to 28 per hundred on PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors over 12 to 52 weeks (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was little heterogeneity among trials (Chi = 23, df = 22, P = 0.38, I = 6%). Similar efficacy was seen for both roflumilast and cilomilast and where use of concomitant long-acting bronchodilators was permitted (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of exacerbation rate and the number of exacerbations experienced on average per participant per year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>), we observed a small significant benefit with treatment, representing a 12% reduction in the rate ratio (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.93).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-FK1-101" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast FK1 101</LINK> trial reported that the probability of experiencing an exacerbation was reduced by 8% with 250 &#956;g of roflumilast and 48% with 500 &#956;g, although the absolute value was not reported, nor whether this was statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms and exercise tolerance</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the mean difference in change from baseline with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor treatment compared with controls on COPD-related symptoms was small, regardless of the scale used to measure it. The only statistically significant effect was seen in one trial of cilomilast, for breathlessness scored using a Borg scale (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). This is a small absolute difference so is of doubtful clinical relevance.</P>
<P>Exercise tolerance using the six-minute walk test was measured in four cilomilast trials. There was no significant difference in walk test distance between treatment and controls (MD 2.09 m, 95% CI -7.39 to 11.57) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The likelihood of a participant experiencing an adverse event was higher with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor treatment than with placebo (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). This effect was seen for both roflumilast and cilomilast.</P>
<P>We noted a range of adverse effects that occurred more frequently in PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor-treated participants. Diarrhoea was more common in PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor-treated groups than in controls (OR 3.13, 95% CI 2.76 to 3.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), as was nausea (OR 3.78, 95% CI 3.23 to 4.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>), headache (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.95) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>), vomiting (OR 4.01, 95% CI 2.80 to 5.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>), dyspepsia (OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.33 to 4.30) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>) and abdominal pain (OR 2.04, (95% CI 1.63 to 2.55) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>). More than 10% of participants in the treatment group experienced gastrointestinal-related side effects, with the most frequently reported symptom being diarrhoea <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). Weight loss was more likely in the treatment groups in the 10 roflumilast trials (OR 3.76, 95% CI 3.11 to 4.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK>), but was not reported in the cilomilast trials. There were no significant differences in the incidence of either influenza-like symptoms (<LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>) or upper respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>) between treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>The higher dose of roflumilast (500 &#956;g) was associated with more adverse effects than the 250 &#956;g dose; however, this was based on only four trials and confidence intervals were wide (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>). In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Compton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Compton 2001</LINK> that studied the effects of varying doses of cilomilast, adverse effects were seen in 52% of the placebo group, 48% of the cilomilast 5 mg group, 47% of the 10 mg group and 61% of the 15 mg group, with rates of serious adverse events similar across the groups.</P>
<P>An increase in withdrawals attributed to adverse effects was recorded for both roflumilast and cilomilast treatment groups (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>). There was, however, no significant effect of treatment on non-fatal serious adverse events (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.35" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.35</LINK>) or mortality (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>), although mortality was a relatively rare event during the trials.</P>
<P>We recorded the number of psychiatric adverse events from pooled data from all parallel-design, double-blind studies investigating roflumilast collated and presented to the FDA. This included data from the 15 fully published trials, but excluded <LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-JP_x002d_706" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast JP-706</LINK>, which was conducted by a different study collaborator. These results reported symptoms of depression separately from depressed mood, depressive symptoms or major depression. There was a higher risk in the roflumilast 500 &#956;g treatment group, compared with placebo, of experiencing a psychiatric-related adverse event (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.37" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.37</LINK>). This was reported in three people out of 100 in the placebo group, compared to seven (95% CI 6 to 8) out of 100 for the PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor-treated group (NNTH 28, 95% CI 21 to 39). Based on outcomes reported in more recent roflumilast trials the numbers of participants experiencing insomnia or sleep disorders (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.70) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.38" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.38</LINK>), symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.62) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.39" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.39</LINK>) or depression (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.40" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.40</LINK>) were higher in the roflumilast group compared with the placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of psychiatric adverse events in the roflumilast 250 &#956;g treatment group compared with placebo as in each of the analyses, the 95% confidence intervals crossed the midline.</P>
<P>In the roflumilast COPD safety database (n = 12,054 participants), there were three reports of completed suicides and two suicide attempts in roflumilast-treated participants compared to none in participants treated with placebo.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>A moderate but significant level of heterogeneity existed for the change in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>outcome when all trials were pooled (I = 48%). Using a random-effects model made no difference to the levels of statistical significance or degree of heterogeneity for the change in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>(<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There were too many 'Risk of bias' domains judged to be at 'unclear' risk of bias to do subgroup analysis according to study quality. Of note, some effect sizes were greater in the published trials; for example, the treatment effect on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was MD 55.75 mL (95% CI 49.44 to 62.06) in the 19 published trials, and MD 34.82 (95% CI 25.44 to 44.19) in the eight unpublished trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), which was a statistically significant difference (test for subgroup differences: Chi = 13.18, df = 1 (P = 0.0003)). This is illustrated in the funnel plot with more unpublished studies showing a smaller treatment effect (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>By visual analysis of the forest plot and sequential elimination, the six-week <LINK REF="STD-Compton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Compton 2001</LINK> cilomilast trial was identified as a major contributor towards the heterogeneity of pooled FEV<SUB>1</SUB> results. When it was removed, the overall I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic decreased from 48% to 31% and in the cilomilast subgroup from 62% to 0%. It is notable that this study had the shortest treatment duration of six weeks and showed the largest improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> lung function from baseline in the treatment group across all studies.</P>
<P>To see whether the size of the treatment effect varied with COPD severity, we conducted subgroup analyses of trials where the mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at baseline was available (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The effects seen in both old GOLD grades I or II (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 50% or more) predicted and old GOLD grades III or IV (FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>less than 50%) were both statistically significant, and of similar magnitude, test for subgroup differences: Chi = 0.03, df = 1 (P = 0.86).</P>
<P>Similarly, there was a difference in the effect size of the total SGRQ score between published and unpublished trials (MD -1.98, 95% CI -3.07 to -0.89 versus MD -0.43, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.40, test for subgroup differences: Chi = 4.94, df = 1 (P = 0.03)) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). Subgroup analysis showed COPD severity had no bearing on the size of the change in quality-of-life score test for subgroup differences: Chi = 0.02, df = 1 (P = 0.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>For both primary outcomes, that is, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and SGRQ score, the size of the treatment effect, that is, the mean difference between PDE<SUB>4</SUB> and placebo groups, was significantly greater in short studies of 6 to 12 weeks, compared with 24- and 52-week studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-15 12:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>This systematic review evaluated randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy and safety of oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE<SUB>4</SUB>) inhibitors in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The first major finding, based on data from 34 trials, was that both roflumilast and cilomilast led to significantly greater improvements in lung function from baseline, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), forced vital capacity (FVC) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), than placebo. Furthermore, the improvement in lung function was seen regardless of the severity of the disease. This improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> lung function occurred whether or not treatment was given in addition to other COPD treatments, such as long-acting beta-2 agonists or anticholinergics, compared to treatment alone or with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).</P>
<P>The mean change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was, however, below what is usually considered a minimum clinically important difference (100 mL, <LINK REF="REF-Donohue-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donohue 2005</LINK>), but comparable to those seen with other COPD treatments in recent large RCTs. For example, the mean improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 49 mL with treatment seen in moderate to severe COPD in this review is of similar magnitude to that seen with fluticasone (47 mL), salmeterol (42 mL), and fluticasone and salmeterol combined (92 mL) in the <LINK REF="REF-TORCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TORCH 2007</LINK> study in people with severe COPD.</P>
<P>A second major finding, based on data from 23 trials, was that participants were more likely to be exacerbation-free while being treated with PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors compared with controls. Overall, participants were 22% less likely to have an exacerbation, translating to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of around 20 (95% CI 16 to 26), for one person to be exacerbation-free in the study period <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. While the likelihood of an individual experiencing an exacerbation was lowered with PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitor treatment, the decrease in the overall rate of exacerbations was less marked, with a relative reduction of 13%.</P>
<P>Taken together, these two major findings suggest that PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors in people with COPD are acting independently of other treatments, particularly bronchodilators. This is an encouraging finding that could be consistent with a broad anti-inflammatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Fabbri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabbri 2009</LINK>). On the other hand, short-duration studies showed more favourable results than the longer studies, but the reasons for this are unclear. Significant heterogeneity was noted among the trials, suggesting that unmeasured differences between the trials may be having an impact.</P>
<P>A third major finding of the review was that, despite significant improvements in lung function and a reduction in exacerbations in participants treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors, there was only a small improvement in quality of life as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. Quality of life had been chosen as a primary outcome because of concerns as to whether or not the adverse effects of PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors might outweigh any beneficial COPD-related effects. The average change in SGRQ total score was 1.06 units (over a duration of between six and 12 months), and was of similar magnitude among trials of participants with milder or more severe COPD. Although this improvement was statistically significant, a change of greater than four units is usually regarded as the minimum clinically important difference (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). While symptom scores were marginally better in the treatment groups, there was no change seen in exercise tolerance, suggesting that improvements in respiratory symptoms may not necessarily translate into enhancement of physical functioning. There were, though, fewer trials assessable for these outcomes, raising the possibility of type 1 or type 2 errors.</P>
<P>This review found that adverse effects were greater in the roflumilast and cilomilast-treated participants than in those receiving placebo, particularly gastrointestinal-related effects such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia. More recently, there has been greater awareness of the risk of psychiatric adverse events associated with roflumilast treatment, in particular the increased likelihood of experiencing sleep disturbances, anxiety and depressed mood. Participants in the treatment groups were also more likely to withdraw from the trials because of adverse effects; on average 14% in the treatment groups withdrew compared with 8% in the control groups. Similarly, there is a slight excess in the total number of participants in the treatment groups experiencing any adverse effect, compared with controls (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). As this analysis included symptoms as well as exacerbations, which were reduced in the treatment groups, this analysis will tend to under-estimate the excess of non COPD-related adverse effects occurring with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitor treatment.</P>
<P>It was notable that treatment with roflumilast was associated with a significant chance of weight loss. Whether this was due to anorexia from gastrointestinal adverse effects, or another effect, is not yet clear. Also not clear is whether cilomilast has the same effect, as it has not been studied. Weight loss may be a beneficial effect in people with COPD who are obese. In contrast, low body mass in the later stages of COPD is associated with a worse prognosis and is notoriously difficult to reverse (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2017</LINK>). This adverse effect warrants further investigation. Reassuringly, there was no increase in serious adverse effects or mortality, although trials were of relatively short duration, and analyses were underpowered to report on the latter outcome.</P>
<P>While a lower dose (250 &#956;g) of roflumilast produced similar improvements in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) and was associated with slightly fewer adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>) than the larger dose, this was associated with a smaller reduction in rate of exacerbations than the 500 &#956;g dose, in the one trial that reported this (<LINK REF="STD-Roflumilast-FK1-101" TYPE="STUDY">Roflumilast FK1 101</LINK>). Moreover, data on the lower dose were only available in a limited number of studies and it has not been studied as add-on therapy to other bronchodilators.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-13 03:15:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have reviewed all known published and unpublished trials identified from standard Cochrane searches, as well as from the trials register for the NIH and from pharmaceutical websites.</P>
<P>We have not been able to verify the pooled endpoint data for psychiatric- (treatment possibly harmful) and cardiovascular-related adverse events (treatment possibly beneficial) as they were obtained from reports on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website and from <LINK REF="REF-White-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2013</LINK>, respectively.</P>
<P>To ensure our Cochrane systematic review accurately reflects all known outcomes of roflumilast therapy, for the previous update we approached the manufacturer of roflumilast for study-level data on each of the cardiovascular outcomes (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) as well as the composite outcome, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). This would have allowed us to perform comparisons both within (i.e. between roflumilast and placebo groups) and among the studies. Unfortunately, our request for individual trial data was refused with the following reasons being cited:</P>
<UL>
<LI>it is inappropriate from a statistical perspective to look into individual trials with too small a sample size for this kind of relatively rare endpoint;</LI>
<LI>it was part of the retrospective analyses to evaluate the whole data set with a sufficiently broad database and not to go into subcuts per study that would comprise studies with numbers in each treatment arm that were too low for conclusive interpretation;</LI>
<LI>in none of the studies was the blinded adjudication of the events implemented as a prospective analysis, which would have required a data release in terms of transparency in each individual study (which is the reason why it was not mentioned in the original publications of the individual trials).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In response to the statement by representatives of Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited, we have urged that these issues be reconsidered for future studies and that study data be made more widely available. Finally, caution must be used when interpreting associations between COPD exacerbations and MACE, because although the treatment groups were matched at baseline, it cannot be assumed that these groups are equivalent when looking only at the group of participants who experienced exacerbations. These concerns could not be assessed in this review as further study data were not provided.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-09-13 03:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the key outcomes of changes in lung function and quality of life, there were greater beneficial effects of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors reported in the published studies than in the unpublished studies, raising concerns about publication bias. There was a moderate level of heterogeneity identified in both of the primary outcomes for this review, which is not fully explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses according to study duration or concomitant medication use. This suggests unknown factors that may impact on the effect size, and has led us to downgrade the quality of the evidence and certainty of our findings (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In contrast, the blinded design of the studies comparing roflumilast or cilomilast with placebo protected against detection bias in our view. The quality of evidence for a reduction in exacerbation was therefore higher for this comparison. On balance, we believe the true beneficial effect of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors is likely to be no greater than we have reported, and probably less; equally the harms may have been understated (partly due to higher withdrawal rates in active treatment arms). On the other hand, as subgroup analyses for COPD severity are based on the mean predicted lung function for the study group and not individual participants, we cannot rule out that there is a benefit for individuals of a specific COPD phenotype.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-03-31 03:14:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential biases in the review process were minimised by double-checking of data extraction and input. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare and have not been involved in prescribing these medicines as neither roflumilast nor cilomilast are available on the New Zealand pharmaceutical schedule.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-13 03:16:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been several other meta analyses conducted, such as <LINK REF="REF-Oba-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oba 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Luo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2016</LINK>. Each of these had fewer studies than the present review, but had findings and conclusions that were similar.</P>
<P>In a post hoc pooled analysis (n =5595) of four trials in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rennard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennard 2014</LINK>), roflumilast significantly improved transition dyspnoea index (TDI) focal scores of breathlessness versus placebo at week 52 (treatment difference, 0.327; P &lt; 0.0001). Roflumilast was associated with significantly greater TDI responders and significantly fewer TDI deteriorators (&#8805; 1-unit increase or decrease from baseline, respectively) versus placebo at week 52 (P &lt; 0.01, both). Rates of MACE in COPD participants treated with PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors have been meta-analysed and reported in a paper published by <LINK REF="REF-White-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2013</LINK>. This found that the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke, when combined into a composite outcome (MACE), was reduced in the roflumilast group compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; P = 0.019). On the other hand, hazard ratios for treatment effects for each of these types of event individually were statistically different. Cardiovascular events were higher in participants with baseline cardiovascular risk factors than in those without baseline cardiovascular risk (defined as the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and/or a history of heart disease). In addition, it was found that the difference between treatment and placebo was only statistically significant in the group of participants without baseline risk factors. Event rates in a subgroup of trials that were one year in duration found no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups in the proportion of participants who reported a MACE, even when divided into those who did, or did not experience a COPD exacerbation. Similarly, between participants with and without MACE events, the proportions of participants experiencing exacerbations was similar (43.2% and 42.1%, respectively).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-09-13 03:16:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (PDE<SUB>4</SUB>) are oral medicines that may be taken in combination with other standard chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments. Most evidence exists for roflumilast at a dose of 500 &#956;g daily and cilomilast at 15 mg twice daily.</P>
<P>Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors join an increasing list of treatments for COPD that improve short-term lung function and reduce exacerbations, but have not been shown to increase life expectancy. Trials to date have been one year or less in duration. In contrast to long-acting bronchodilators, PDE<SUB>4 </SUB>inhibitors have minimal benefits on symptoms on a day-to-day basis, or quality of life, and are often associated with adverse effects, especially of the gastrointestinal system, and headaches. Roflumilast is associated with significant weight loss and more psychiatric symptoms than placebo treatment. Thus, the findings of this review support the use of PDE<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors: however, their use may best be limited to add-on therapy in a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management, providing they are well-tolerated.</P>
