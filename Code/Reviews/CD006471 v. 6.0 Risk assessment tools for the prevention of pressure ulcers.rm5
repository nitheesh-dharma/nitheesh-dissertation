<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 20:17:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised injury to the skin, underlying tissue or both, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear (tissue distortion resulting from squeezing and stretching soft tissues between bony structures and the skin). Pressure ulcers mainly occur in people who have limited mobility, nerve damage or both. Pressure ulcer risk assessment is part of the process used to identify individuals at risk of developing a pressure ulcer. Risk assessments generally use checklists and their use is recommended by pressure ulcer prevention guidelines. This review found two studies that were eligible for inclusion. The first study found no difference in the number of new pressure ulcers that developed in individuals assessed using the Braden risk assessment compared with an unstructured risk assessment. However, there were methodological limitations with this study. The second study also found no differences in the number of new pressure ulcers that developed in individuals assessed using the Waterlow risk assessment tool, the Ramstadius risk assessment tool, or using clinical judgement alone. This study did not have methodological limitations. Therefore, to date, there are no studies to suggest that the use of risk assessment tools, reduces the number of new pressure ulcers that develop.</P>

<P>We included two studies in this review. One small, cluster randomised study found no statistical difference in pressure ulcer incidence in patients who were assessed by nurses using the Braden risk assessment tool (n=74) compared with patients assessed by nurses who had receiving training and then used unstructured risk assessment (n=76) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.77) and those patients assessed by nurses using unstructured risk assessment alone (n=106) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.68)<B>

</B> The second study was a large single blind randomised controlled study which compared the effect of risk assessment on pressure ulcer incidence using the Waterlow risk assessment tool (n=411), the Ramstadius risk screening tool (n=420) and no formal risk assessment (n=420). There was no statistical difference in pressure ulcer incidence between the three groups (Waterlow 7.5% (n=31); Ramstadius 5.4% (n=22); clinical judgement 6.8% (n=28) (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.81; Waterlow vs no formal risk assessment), (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.35; Ramstadius vs no formal risk assessment), (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.44; Waterlow vs Ramstadius).</P>

<P>Two studies were identified which evaluated the effect of risk assessment on patient outcomes; In one study, there was no statistically significant difference in pressure ulcer incidence between people who were assessed using the Braden risk assessment tool compared with those receiving unstructured risk assessment. Methodological limitations of this study prevent firm conclusions being drawn. However, a further high quality RCT identified no statistical differences in pressure ulcer incidence when people were assessed using either the Waterlow risk assessment tool, the Ramstadius risk assessment tool, or using clinical judgement alone. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that the use of structured, systematic pressure ulcer risk assessment tools reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:00:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are localised injury to the skin, underlying tissue or both, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with shear (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2009</LINK>). They occur in people who do not have the ability to reposition themselves in order to relieve pressure on bony prominences (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>). This ability is often diminished in the very old, the malnourished and those with an acute illness (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Prevalence rates in long-term care settings fluctuate from 8.8% to 53.2% and incidence rates vary from 7% to 71.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>). The most common anatomical sites for pressure ulcers to occur are the sacrum and the heels, and the majority are grade 1 or grade 2 in severity (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, as age increases, so too does pressure ulcer prevalence and incidence (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2009</LINK>). Changing population demographics and the predicted rise in the number of older persons in the future (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-Census-Bureau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. Census Bureau 2004</LINK>) suggest that there will be a corresponding increase in the number of people with pressure ulcers unless effective preventative measures are put in place .</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers impact negatively on quality of life as it is known that individuals with pressure ulcers frequently experience pain, combined with fear, isolation and anxiety regarding wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spilsbury-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spilsbury 2007</LINK>). Importantly, it has also been shown that pressure ulcers are associated with an increased risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1997</LINK>). One study identified that the risk of dying for elderly patients with a pressure ulcer was three times greater than for those without a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Berlowitz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlowitz 1990</LINK>) although it is probable that pressure ulcers are usually a consequence of poor health rather than a cause of death. Further prospective cohort studies examined the factors predictive of mortality in older individuals admitted to hospital. Both studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alarcon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alarcon 1999</LINK>) conducted a detailed geriatric assessment of 659 and 352 patients on admission, and followed these patients for 10 months. Using regression analysis, the authors identified an odds ratio of 3.64 (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="REF-Bo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bo 2003</LINK>) and 4.19 (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="REF-Alarcon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alarcon 1999</LINK>), respectively, of death in acutely ill elderly people with pressure ulcers, indicating that in these individuals having a pressure ulcer increases the risk of dying.</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers are a significant financial burden to health care systems. Bennett and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004</LINK>) estimated that the total annual cost for pressure ulcer management in the UK is £1.4 to £2.1 billion, which is equivalent to 4% of the total UK healthcare expenditure. Similar findings have been noted in the Netherlands, where pressure ulcers have been found to be the third most expensive health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Haalboom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haalboom 2000</LINK>). It has been suggested that the length of hospital stay is two to three times greater for those with a pressure ulcer, than for similar cases without (30.4 days compared to 12.8 days) (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Globally, the economic impact of pressure ulcers has yet to be established. However, it is known that pressure ulcers are common (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK>) and affect patients in both community (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2002</LINK>) and hospital settings (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that pressure ulcer prevention strategies that can reduce prevalence and incidence rates will have a positive impact on patients and the health service as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-24 12:03:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Use of pressure ulcer risk assessment tools or scales is a component of the assessment process used to identify individuals at risk of developing a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2009</LINK>). Risk assessments generally use checklists that alert practitioners to the most common risk factors that predispose individuals to pressure ulcer development. These checklists are often developed into risk assessment tools, for example the Norton Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1975</LINK>), the Waterlow risk assessment scale (<LINK REF="REF-Waterlow-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterlow 1985</LINK>) and the Braden scale (<LINK REF="REF-Braden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braden 1987</LINK>). It is argued that there is a lack of consensus regarding which variables are the most important indicators of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is not surprising that there are currently almost 40 risk assessment scales in use, most of which are based on the seminal work of <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1975</LINK>, or have been designed in response to a review of the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2004</LINK>). It is clear, however, that the risk factors that predispose an individual to developing a pressure ulcer will vary among patients in different clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Henoch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henoch 2003</LINK>) and it may not be possible to design one risk assessment tool that will meet the needs of all patients in all clinical settings.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 20:02:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Use of a risk assessment tool is recommended by many international pressure ulcer prevention guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rycroft_x002d_Malone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rycroft-Malone 2000</LINK>). The ideal risk assessment tool should be both reliable and valid, and sensitive and specific (<LINK REF="REF-NPUAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NPUAP 1998</LINK>). The tool must accurately identify those individuals who are at risk, as well as those not at risk - and do this consistently (<LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK>). To date, there is little empirical evidence available concerning the reliability and validity of existing tools (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haalboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haalboom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGough 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pancorbo_x002d_Hidalgo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pancorbo-Hidalgo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2002</LINK>). Assessing reliability and validity is a real challenge in clinical practice because risk assessment scales are used to identify those who would develop a pressure ulcer should no interventions be put in place. It is common to use different pressure ulcer prevention strategies once risk has been identified, which will therefore appear to alter the predictive ability of the scale (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halfens-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halfens 2000</LINK>). Different studies using the same risk assessment tools, but in diverse heath care settings with diverse patient populations and prevention strategies in use, report varying levels of sensitivity and specificity (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2002</LINK>). It is of relevance to note that the prevention strategies which were in use in these studies are often not stated (<LINK REF="REF-Halfens-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halfens 2000</LINK>). Lack of clear knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of risk assessment tools has far-reaching implications for practice, because clinical decisions - such as the use, or not, of pressure ulcer preventative strategies - are often made on the basis of the results of risk assessment, although it has been argued also that nurses often use their clinical judgement alone in deciding which preventative measures to use (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2008</LINK>). Therefore, it is likely that some patients are receiving interventions that they do not require, and conversely others are not receiving interventions that they would benefit from (<LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK>). This inappropriate allocation of resources compounds the increasing burden of pressure ulcers, and adds to spiraling healthcare costs. It is important to note that the primary focus of interest for this systematic review is whether or not using a risk assessment tool makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence, as such the review is not looking at the predictive validity of pressure ulcer risk tools.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-22 16:36:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three systematic reviews that explored the effectiveness of pressure ulcer risk assessment tools in the prevention of pressure ulcers have been published previously. The Royal College of Nursing (UK) pressure ulcer prevention guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>) were based largely on the results of the review by <LINK REF="REF-McGough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGough 1999</LINK>. The first review searched from 1962 to 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1995</LINK>), the second review from 1962 to 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-McGough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGough 1999</LINK>) and the third review from 1966 to 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Pancorbo_x002d_Hidalgo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pancorbo-Hidalgo 2006</LINK>). Two reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGough 1999</LINK>) restricted their inclusion criteria to studies published only in the English language; the third review (<LINK REF="REF-Pancorbo_x002d_Hidalgo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pancorbo-Hidalgo 2006</LINK>) restricted the inclusion criteria to four languages: Spanish, English, French and Portuguese. The reviews concluded that they found no evidence that pressure ulcer risk assessment scales reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers. However, given the time since these reviews were written, and the language restrictions that were imposed, it is possible that other relevant literature was originally overlooked, or has been published in the meantime. Therefore, as the searches for these reviews are out of date, and the authors imposed language restrictions, it is timely to conduct a review with no language restrictions and recent searches in order to clarify the role of pressure ulcer risk assessment tools in clinical practice.</P>

We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for the eligible study.

<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The first study was published in 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK>). This cluster randomised study was conducted within a military hospital in Saudi Arabia and compared the effect of three different methods of pressure ulcer risk assessment on the incidence of pressure ulcers in hospitalised individuals with a Braden score of less than or equal to 18 (<LINK REF="REF-Braden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braden 1987</LINK>). The methods of risk assessment were: the Braden pressure ulcer risk assessment tool and training; unstructured risk assessment and training; and unstructured risk assessment alone (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The Braden pressure ulcer risk assessment scale comprises six sub-scales: sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition and friction/shear. Each sub-scale is ranked numerically from 1 to 4; a score of 4 indicates no problem with regard to the specific sub-scale, whereas a score of 1 indicates a significant problem. The friction and shear sub-scale is scored 1 to 3. The scores for each of the sub-scales are totaled to give a final score ranging from 6 to 23; as scores become lower, predicted risk becomes higher (<LINK REF="REF-Braden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braden 1987</LINK>). Data were collected by the lead researcher, who was the Tissue Viability Nurse Specialist at the study site, and two staff nurses trained in the data collection procedure. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> included nine wards within a military hospital and randomly allocated these wards into three groups. Group A nurses (the Braden scale group) received a mandatory wound care management study day, pressure ulcer prevention training programme and specific training on the application of the Braden scale. These nurses were required to implement the Braden scale on their patients in the post-intervention stage. Group B nurses (the training group) were identical to group A but were not required to implement the Braden scale. Group C nurses (the clinical judgement group) received only a mandatory wound care management study day. Data were collected from all patients with Braden scores of &#8804; 18 across the nine wards; follow up was for eight weeks. Patients were nursed on either standard foam mattresses, alternating pressure redistribution devices, gel overlay mattresses or air fluidised mattresses. Repositioning schedules were every two hours, three to four hours, or six hours. The procedure for allocation of mattresses and repositioning schedules are not reported by the study authors. Incidence was recorded as the development of a pressure ulcer during the study period. Pressure ulcers were identified according to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (USA) pressure ulcer classification system (<LINK REF="REF-NPUAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NPUAP 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> did not identify the grade of pressure ulcer damage specifically for each participant but rather reported 'pressure ulcer present' - yes or no.</P>
<P>The second study was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK>). This single blind RCT was conducted among 1231 patients admitted to internal medicine or oncology wards within a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Australia. Participants were allocated to either a Waterlow (n=410) or Ramstadius (n=411) screening tool group or to a clinical judgement group (n=410) where no formal risk screening instrument was used. (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The Waterlow risk assessment tool comprises 7 sub-scales, Build/weight for height; skin type; nutrition; sex/age; continence; mobility; special risks. Each sub-scale is scored individually according to an allocated score to each component of the sub-scale, with the scores added to give an overall risk status. As scores become higher, the predicted risk become correspondingly higher (10+= low risk; 15+= high risk; 20+= very high risk) (<LINK REF="REF-Waterlow-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterlow 1985</LINK>). The main focus of the Ramstadius risk screening tool (<LINK REF="REF-Ramstadius-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramstadius 2000</LINK>) is on mobility status, it is a non numerical tool and begins with the assessment of mobility as yes/no. If the patient can reposition themselves independently no further assessment is required and the patient is deemed not to be at risk. Conversely, if problems with mobility are identified, the patient is deemed to be at high risk and further assessment of risk factors, namely age, medication, skin integrity, temperature, decreased blood volume, dyspnoea and presence of an existing pressure ulcer is undertaken. No scores are given, rather an algorithm is provided to direct interventions which may be appropriate for the specific risk factor.</P>
<P>Following assignment to the screening method, a copy of the instrument was placed in the patient&#8217;s medical record for use by the ward nurse in their admission assessment. Research assistants who were trained in pressure ulcer staging, and who were blinded to the screening method, visually inspected patients for evidence of pressure ulcer formation daily (except weekends). Follow up was for four days. Pressure ulcers were staged according to the NPUAP pressure ulcer staging system (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2007</LINK>). The pressure ulcers that developed were either stage 1 or stage 2, data collection ceased once a pressure ulcer was identified.The authors report that there were no differences in measured processes of care, including use of special mattresses, documentation of an explicit pressure care plan, referral to the specialist skin integrity nurse or referral to a dietician between the three groups.</P>

<P>Results for dichotomous variables are presented as RR with 95% CI. Risk ratio is the rate of the event of interest (e.g. pressure ulcers developed) in the experimental group divided by the rate of this event in the control group and indicates the chances of pressure ulcer development for people in the experimental group compared with the control group. An RR of 1 means there is no difference in risk between the two study groups, an RR of &lt; 1 means the event is less likely to occur in the experimental group than in the control group and an RR of &gt; 1 means the event is more likely to occur in the experimental group than in the control group.</P>

<P>Some methodological issues require consideration and limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this review. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> randomisation was not at the individual level but rather at the unit level, where each ward served as the unit of randomisation and all patients within the ward were in the same group. This type of randomisation is called cluster-randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Medical-Research-Council-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Research Council 2002</LINK>). Cluster-randomised trials increase efficiency and study protocol compliance whilst avoiding contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2004</LINK>). Contamination is said to occur when an intervention is given to an individual but may affect others within the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Puffer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puffer 2005</LINK>) or when the intervention is given by accident to the control group.</P>
<P>The disadvantages of cluster-randomisation is that all the individuals in the cluster cannot be assumed to be independent of one another and, furthermore, the analysis is not at the level of randomisation but is at the group level (<LINK REF="REF-Elley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elley 2004</LINK>). A way to overcome the disadvantages is to allow for the effects of clustering in the analysis of the data using, for example, regression models (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2005</LINK>). Normally, with individual randomisation, one would expect there to be a variance in the responses within study groups. Clustering can exert an effect on this variance yielding a correlation of responses within the clusters. When cluster-randomisation is used, this needs to be considered during both the sample size calculation and the data analysis. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> was small and the authors did not report that they accounted for the use of cluster-randomisation in either the sample size calculation, nor in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK>). Conversely, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> randomised at the individual level, thereby enhancing the comparability between the study groups.</P>
<P>Concealment of group allocation was inadequately described in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK>. Allocation concealment is a randomisation method that prevents the researcher influencing which group, experimental or control, a participant is allocated to (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), therein ensuring that the participant is assigned to a specific study group by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It has been suggested that lack of a clear description of allocation concealment leads to bias in assessing the outcome of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>); the size of the effect could be overestimated and so give a false impression of the value of the intervention. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> used computer generated, phone randomisation, thereby minimising the risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Blinding of the study is said to be complete if the investigators, the participants, the outcome assessor and the individual analysing the data have no idea which group the participant is allocated to (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> did not report blinding of the patient, the staff, the data collector or the data analyst. Whilst it would not have been feasible to blind care givers as they must know the allocation because they are conducting the risk assessment, it would have been possible to blind the outcome assessors and data analyst. <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> ensured that the patient and the outcome assessor were blinded to group assignment, thereby minimising the risk of performance bias and detection bias.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) means that participants are analysed according to the group they were originally allocated to even if they did not adhere to the study protocol or complete the study. The rationale for using ITT analysis is two-fold; it maintains treatment groups that are similar (apart from random variation) and therefore validates the use of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>), and allows for handling of protocol deviations, further protecting the randomisation process (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). In essence, omitting those who do not complete the study from the final analysis may bias the outcomes of the study because those who do not complete may do so because of adverse effects of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> did not report use of ITT; pressure ulcer incidence is reported for all patients in the post-training groups but it is not clear whether any randomised patients withdrew. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> ensured that all the participants allocated to each group were analysed for the primary outcome, thereby minimising the risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>Baseline data refers to the data collected from each participant before beginning the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1996</LINK>). This includes demographic information, medical condition, prognostic factors and, where appropriate, socioeconomic information. This allows the researcher to determine if participants in both arms of the study are comparable at the outset of the study (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1996</LINK>) and allows those evaluating the study to determine if the characteristics of those participating in the study are similar to those normally encountered in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> provides details of the baseline characteristics of the participants and does not identify statistically significant differences at baseline between the study groups. <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK> report that, overall, the groups were not comparable at baseline for medical diagnoses, pressure ulcer prevention practices, use of barrier creams and use of vitamin supplementary therapy. This was not an issue in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>Use of pressure ulcer risk assessment tools or scales is a component of the assessment process used to identify individuals at risk of developing a pressure ulcer and is recommended by many international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>). This review identified no RCT evidence to suggest that conducting a structured risk assessment makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence. This finding is in keeping with previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGough 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pancorbo_x002d_Hidalgo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pancorbo-Hidalgo 2006</LINK>) which also found a lack of published literature that reliably assesses whether the use of a risk assessment tool reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>Pressure ulcer risk assessment tools are widely used in clinical practice, although not necessarily in all healthcare settings (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK>) and as such it is impossible to unlearn what has been gained during the experience of using a risk assessment tool. This means that use of an individual's clinical judgement alone, without use of a risk assessment tool, will ultimately be influenced by prior knowledge of risk assessment tools. Thus, it is possible that within the clinical setting risk assessment follows a structured format similar to that of the current risk assessment tools even in the absence of a paper/electronic version of the tool (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2008</LINK>). One therefore might not see a difference in pressure ulcer incidence because the tool does not add to the quality of the clinical judgement. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK> argues that if nurses act according to risk assessment scales, 80% of the patients would unnecessarily receive preventive measures. Furthermore, use of preventative measures impacts negatively on the predictive ability of the risk assessment tool. One may consider the presence of a pressure ulcer in an individual identified to be at risk to be a success of the risk assessment process; however, this actually indicates a failure of prevention methods (<LINK REF="STD-Defloor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Defloor 2005</LINK>). It would be interesting to determine what information is gathered using clinical judgement alone to assess whether this matches the data collected using structured risk assessment. If there were a relationship between the two methods of assessment then a reduction in pressure ulcer incidence, due to the introduction of structured risk assessment, would not be anticipated. Thus, in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK>, it is unclear what impact prior knowledge of pressure ulcer risk assessment had on the clinical judgement of the participants and as such this should be bone in mind in consideration of the generalisability of findings to other healthcare settings.</P>
<P>It has been argued that pressure ulcer risk assessment is in itself not an intervention but rather a precursor to the development of an appropriate plan of care to combat or reduce the impact of the risk factors identified (<LINK REF="REF-Lindgren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindgren 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2008</LINK> suggests that if a risk assessment tool is working well, then a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers should follow. Presumably this means that the risk assessment is followed by appropriate risk intervention, and that these interventions are available and effective. It is evident from the literature, however, that this is not always the case (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>). Indeed, <LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK> found that only 9.7% of patients in a pan-European prevalence study were receiving adequate preventative measures in terms of repositioning and provision of pressure redistributing devices. Furthermore, in a survey of registered nurses <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK> found that pressure ulcer prevention was not always a high priority, with some nurses admitting to being less interested in pressure ulcer prevention than other aspects of nursing care. Fundamentally, risk assessment alone will make no difference unless it is followed up by an intervention to combat risk, and these interventions need to be available. Interestingly, the method of risk assessment employed in the <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK> study did not influence the interventions offered to patients, indeed, there were no differences in measured processes of care, including use of special mattresses, documentation of an explicit pressure care plan, referral to the specialist skin integrity nurse or referral to a dietician between the three groups. Thus, although risk assessment is suggested to be a precursor to planning and implementing care, it appears that this may not always be the case.</P>
<P>One cluster RCT at high risk of bias has explored the impact of pressure ulcer risk assessment on patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Saleh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 2009</LINK>). However, methodological issues with the study make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, a further large RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2011</LINK>) at low risk of bias, identified no statistical differences in pressure ulcer incidence when patients were assessed using either the Waterlow risk assessment tool, the Ramstadius risk assessment tool, or using clinical judgement alone. However, as the studies included here were within two specific clinical settings (military hospital and internal medicine or oncology) there is limited generalisability to other high risk groups for example elderly residents of care homes. Therefore, as yet, there is no RCT evidence to suggest that conducting pressure ulcer risk assessment makes any difference to the number of pressure ulcers that develop. If the use of risk assessment tools/scales continues to be used in clinical practice, in the absence of empirical knowledge regarding its effect on clinical outcomes, issues will arise concerning resource utilisation and this in turn will add to increasing healthcare costs.</P>

<P>Pressure ulcer risk assessment is an integral component of pressure ulcer prevention and is widely utilised in clinical practice. To date, there is no RCT evidence to suggest that undertaking structured pressure ulcer risk assessment makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence. However, as there is limited generalisability of the findings from this review to other high risk groups there is a need to conduct further research aimed at establishing, among other high risk groups, whether the conduct of risk assessment makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence. Future research should ensure that the following are incorporated:</P>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> respectively. The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format. The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). No date or language restrictions were applied.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources</HEADING>
<P>We searched citations in all retrieved and relevant publications identified by these strategies for further studies. We contacted experts in the wound care field, namely council members of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, the European Wound Management Association, The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and the World Union of Wound Healing Societies to identify any studies not located through the primary search. There were no restrictions on articles on the basis of language or date of publication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon)</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category.</P>

<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
