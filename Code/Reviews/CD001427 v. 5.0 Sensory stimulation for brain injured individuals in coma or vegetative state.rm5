<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No strong evidence about the effects of sensory stimulation for a brain-injured person in a coma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>About half of people in a coma (deep unconsciousness) because of traumatic brain injury will wake within a year of the accident. Speeding recovery to allow people to wake sooner is a priority for them and their family. One type of treatment uses sensory stimulation to try to keep the person's brain working normally. Sensory stimulation methods vary greatly, from one or two hourly sessions of a day, through to shorter sessions every hour for 12 to 14 hours a day. The review found there is no strong evidence to determine whether sensory stimulation benefits people in comas.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Coma and vegetative state follow traumatic brain injury in about one out of eight patients, and in patients with non traumatic injury the prognosis is worse. The use of sensory stimulation for coma and vegetative state has gained popularity during the 1980's but beliefs and opinions about its effectiveness vary substantially among health professionals. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of sensory stimulation programmes in patients in coma or vegetative state.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Injuries Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled trials register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PSYCHLIT from 1966 to January 2002, without language restriction. Reference lists of articles were scanned and we contacted experts in the area to find other relevant studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or controlled trials that compared sensory stimulation programmes with standard rehabilitation in patients in coma or vegetative state.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Abstracts and papers found were screened by one reviewer. Three reviewers independently identified relevant studies, extracted data and assessed study quality resolving disagreement by consensus.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three studies were identified with 68 patients in total. The overall methodological quality was poor and studies differed widely in terms of outcomes measures, study design and conduct. We therefore did not carry out any quantitative synthesis but reviewed results of available studies qualitatively.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review indicates that there is no reliable evidence to support, or rule out, the effectiveness of multisensory programmes in patients in coma or vegetative state.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 11:19:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Prolonged coma and vegetative state follow severe traumatic brain injury in about one of eight patients with severe closed-head injury assessed at discharge from a Trauma Centre (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1991</LINK>). According to the Traumatic Coma Data Bank, 52 per cent of the vegetative survivors from severe head trauma regain consciousness within one year post-injury and 40 per cent improve to a higher Glasgow Outcome Scale within six months (<LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-on-PVS" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force on PVS</LINK>). The remaining individuals die or remain in a vegetative state for months or years.</P>
<P>The outcome for individuals in coma or vegetative state with non-traumatic brain injury is worse than that for those with traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Sazbon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazbon 1993</LINK>). In one trial, of 100 patients, 20 recovered consciousness within five months, 31 had died by six months after onset, and 49 remained unconscious for the remainder of their lives. Only seven individuals were alive after 72 months of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Sazbon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazbon 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the early 1950's researchers at the Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential (I.A.H.P.) proposed the idea that programmes of environmental sensory input, at a frequency, intensity, and duration far greater than those in the usual hospital setting, could enhance the speed and degree of recovery from coma. They stated that "in comatose patients, although the problem is primarily cerebral, there is a condition of environmental deprivation that could lead to widespread impairment of intellectual and perceptual processes accompanied by changes in cerebral electrical activity" (<LINK REF="STD-Le-Winn-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Le Winn 1978</LINK>). The use of sensory stimulation for coma and vegetative state gained popularity in the western world, despite a lack of scientific evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zasler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zasler 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Giacino-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giacino 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>The intensity of sensory stimulation treatment proposed by different authors has varied considerably. Ranging from one or two cycles of stimulation daily, of approximately one hour each (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1990</LINK>), to one session of multimodal stimulation and one session of unimodal stimulation a day for 10 minutes each (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1991</LINK>), to hourly stimulatory cycles, lasting approximately 15-20 minutes, for 12-14 hours per day, six days a week (<LINK REF="STD-Doman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Doman 1993</LINK>). Yet another approach has been proposed by Wood, who in 1991, performed a critical analysis of the concept of sensory stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1991</LINK>). He outlined that "clinical experience has shown that patients exposed to an undifferentiated bombardment of sensory information lose the ability to process information due to the background noise (habituation)". Wood introduced the 'Sensory Regulation' approach, based on the concept of regulating the way in which stimulations are delivered (i.e. create a quiet environment, regulate the way in which staff communicate with patient, etc.) (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Owing to the severe impact on the life of many individuals, both those with a brain injury and their relatives, it is urgent to know whether these treatments are more effective than a standard rehabilitation programme in promoting recovery from coma and vegetative state. Moreover, as randomised control trials do not seem to be easily accepted in the rehabilitation community we will discuss potential problem in designing and conducting RCTs in this area.</P>

<P>Patients diagnosed as brain injured with traumatic and non-traumatic etiology (i.e. anoxic), of any age and gender. Patients are defined in different ways in original studies. For the purpose of this review we accepted two definitions. The first, proposed by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-ACRM-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACRM 1995</LINK>), classified patients in two sub-categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a) Coma: unarousable with absence of sleep/wake cycles on electroencephalogram and loss of the ability of environmental interaction. Major neurobehavioral criteria: the patient's eyes do not open either spontaneously or to external stimulation, the patient does not follow any commands.</LI>
<LI>b) Vegetative State: loss of the ability to interact with the environment despite the capacity for spontaneous or stimulus-induced arousal, sleep/wake cycles may be present on EEG and subcortical reflexes are partially or fully preserved. Major neurobehavioral criteria: the patient's eyes open spontaneously or after stimulation; the patient does not follow any commands.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The second classification is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) where coma is defined when GSC is equal to, or less than, eight (<LINK REF="REF-Teasdale-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasdale 1974</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1993</LINK>
<BR/>This was a randomised controlled trial including 14 male coma patients with GCS equal to or less than eight who suffered acute brain injury due to a road traffic accident and were admitted within 24 hours to an Intensive Care Unit. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Seven patients (mean age 27.7, mean GCS 4.8) were allocated to the active intervention group who underwent therapeutic sessions where all five senses (olfactory, visual, auditory, gustatory, tactile) were vigorously stimulated. The sessions lasted 20 minutes a day throughout the patients stay in ICU. The other seven patients (mean age 31.4, mean GCS 4.8) in the control group, received usual care without any specified sensory stimulation programme. The outcome measures, which were assessed daily, were GCS, state of ventilation, spontaneous eye movements, oculocephalic response and oculovestibular response. Skin conductance, heart rate and blood test were assessed 20 minutes before and after treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kater-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kater 1989</LINK>
<BR/>This was a controlled clinical trial (CCT) with 30 head injured patients at least two weeks after the trauma. There were 18 male and 12 female participants, (mean age 28 years) with GCS ranging from three to 14 and length of coma ranging from six hours to six months. The study compared a multisensory stimulation programme with usual rehabilitation. The two groups (active intervention and usual rehabilitation), with 15 patients each, were matched for age, sex, type of injury, GCS and length of time from injury each selected from two different health care facilities. Within the two groups, patients were further classified into three subgroups on the basis of GCS score: Deep (GCS 3-6), Moderate (7-10) and Light (11-14). The experimental treatment consisted of a section of stimulation of six modalities: visual, auditory, olfactory, cutaneous, kinestesic and oral, that lasted 45 minutes, twice a day, six days per week until the patients were aroused from coma. Maximum duration of treatment was three months. The outcome measure assessed was 'Level of Cognitive Functioning' (LCF) at two weeks and six months after injury. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1990</LINK>
<BR/>The third study was a CCT comparing a coma arousal procedure (CAP) in 12 patients with severe head injury with a matched group of 12 participants receiving usual rehabilitation. The two groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics, type and location of head injury, surgical intervention and GCS on admission to hospital. The trial began when patients reached clinical stability (mean 7.9 days). The active intervention group underwent a 'cycle' of sensory stimulation: auditory, tactile, olfactory, taste, visual and kinestesic (60 minutes), one or two times a day, for six days a week, for a maximum of four weeks. Outcomes assessed in this study were GCS score, recorded weekly for four weeks, and total duration of coma.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 11:19:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The one randomised controlled trial found (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1993</LINK>) did not report details of the method of allocation concealment used. For the two controlled clinical trials (CCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Kater-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kater 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1990</LINK>) important details of the methods used to select the groups, (i.e. were patients truly consecutive? Did referral criteria differ from one ward to another? etc.), were not reported. None of the three studies used blinding for outcome assessment. All the studies included all patients originally recruited in the final analysis although for the two CCTs this is more difficult to assess given the nature of the study design.<BR/>As far as the appropriateness of the outcome measures used is concerned, two studies used the GCS only without any other indicator of functional status. The study by Kater (<LINK REF="STD-Kater-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kater 1989</LINK>) used the LCF scale but analysed results inappropriately considering it a continuous variable rather than a descriptive-nominal one. Only one study presented a functional assessment at a fairly long follow-up (three months). Studies recruited very few patients (range 14-30).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>As only one study was randomised and studies differed widely in terms of outcomes measured, as well other important aspects of study design and conduct, we did not carry out any quantitative synthesis of data.</P>
<P>Overall none of the three studies provided useful and valid results on outcomes of clinical relevance for coma patients. Johnson (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1993</LINK>) did not report information on the main outcome measure (GCS) and only presented data of questionable clinical relevance (i.e. heart rate, skin conductance, cathecholamine, 3-methoxy,4-hydroxyphenylglicol.). The statistical analysis of data in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kater-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kater 1989</LINK>) was flawed because the LCF scale was analysed as a continuous rather than as a qualitative variable. Therefore, the statistically significant difference in favour of the actively treated group reported in the study must be interpreted with caution. Finally, the study by Mitchell (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1990</LINK>) reported a significant difference in the mean length of coma in favour of the experimental group (22 days - SD 9.7 versus 26.9 days - SD 6.6 - control group, p&lt;0,05). However, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure, divorced from any other functional indicator, is questionable. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">a) Quality and reliability of available studies</HEADING>
<P>We found three studies meeting our inclusion criteria of which only one was a randomised controlled trial. Overall, this review does not provide enough information to allow us to make any conclusions about the effect of sensory stimulation in coma patients. Considering the health care, social and emotional implications that the treatment of coma and vegetative state patients has for patients, family and their carers, the dearth of reliable data and poor quality of the studies is astonishing. Although this review does not support or rule out the effectiveness of this intervention, we still believe that this critical appraisal may provide useful insight for further studies in this area.</P>
<P>One of the major methodological drawbacks in the studies reviewed is the inconsistent use of definitions of coma and vegetative state. This led to important inter-study variation of the criteria used to assess arousal from coma. In the Kater study, for example, patients with GSC values in the 10-14 range have also been included and this raises important questions about the comparability of the results of this study with others. This, together with the unblinded evaluation of the patient status could lead to important biases.<BR/>
<BR/>Methodological rigor is also lacking in the definition of the experimental intervention (ie. sensory stimulations). In the Kater study, for example, relatives were asked to deliver stimuli but no information was presented on how they were trained, what they did in practice and whether this was done in addition to the stimulation delivered by therapists during sessions or instead of it. Also relatives were asked to assess patient's reactions to the intervention but again without any information on how this was done and how it was used in the analysis. In the Mitchell study sessions lasted 45 minutes but the study reports that one or two sessions could be delivered without giving details of what criterion, if any, was used to decide on the intensity of treatment.</P>
<P>Two of the three studies included in this review used outcomes of questionable clinical relevance. In the studies we reviewed the use of functional outcomes that could add important clinically relevant information was extremely rare. Johnson used only physiological/biochemical markers and Mitchell measured the length of coma alone without looking at whether this was associated with a lower score on any disability measure.<BR/>It is unfortunate that the study by Kater, the only one that used a functional outcome (Levels of Cognitive function, LCF), used inappropriate statistical analysis that meant the results could not be interpreted reliably.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">b) Is the dearth of rigorous studies justifiable?</HEADING>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are still rarely used in this setting and their suitability to evaluate interventions in rehabilitation have been debated (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 1994</LINK>). In the case of the intervention considered in this review, however, we do not think there are good reasons why randomised controlled trials cannot be conducted. As sensory stimulation represents an intervention that is additional to standard care it is hard to see why patients could not be randomised. Furthermore, as potential bias in outcome assessment may occur it is important to overcome this by having independent assessment of the impact of sensory stimulation on patients. Reservations about the feasibility of conducting RCTs may also arise from the idea that providers' skills in delivering stimuli may bias the results. This may be true but the same objection may be made in many other clinical situations (i.e. surgery, psychosocial interventions etc) where RCTs have been carried out. It is true, however, that an important limitation to the conduct of reliable studies in this area is the lack of sufficiently sensitive and valid tools for outcome assessment.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review indicates that there is no reliable evidence to support, or rule out, the effectiveness of multisensory programmes in patients in a coma or vegetative state.</P>
<P>The need to improve our current knowledge in this field, as well as the dearth of effective treatments in this area, strongly indicates that the delivery of treatment interventions based on the concept of 'sensory stimulation' should be provided only in the context of properly designed and adequately sized randomised controlled trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future studies in this area are needed. As almost 50% of patients have a spontaneous arousal after the acute event, and because of the difficulty of delivering rehabilitation programmes in the intensive care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Grosswasser-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosswasser 1990</LINK>) where patients are often sedated and assessment are usually made on physiological measurments, studies should recruit patients in a stable clinical condition who are discharged from intensive care units. The size of the studies should be sufficient to detect a clinically relevant difference between study groups. To recruit sufficient numbers of patients it may be necessary to organise multi-centre randomised controlled trials.<BR/>Outcomes measured should be both related to the impairment but also to functional abilities. The latter should be evaluated at least at an interval of six to 12 months in order to evaluate the consistency of the findings overtime. Due to the potential for bias due to subjectivity and expectations from carers, outcomes should be subject to a rigorous blinded assessment. </P>
