<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-21 10:56:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Haemorrhoids, one of the common perianal diseases, may easily lead to haematochezia, perianal inflammation, perianal venous prolapse or incarceration once it progresses to a serious stage. Besides surgical operation or minimally invasive treatment, a variety of Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs (TCMHs) have been used for treating bleeding haemorrhoids in many patients in China. TCMHs might be effective for this illness and provide an alternative therapeutic measure. However, our primary research for this review showed that there was no strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. The included studies were few and of low quality. Limited, weak evidence showed that some formulae, when including Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophorae, etc., may alleviate some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids. These symptoms include hematochezia and congestive haemorrhoidal cushions, in the short term. Additional, standardised trials are needed for meta-analysis to draw a final conclusion.</P>

<P>This review did not provide strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids.

These include hematochezia, congestive haemorrhoidal cushions and inflammation of perianal mucosa in the short term. Well-designed clinical trials are required urgently before any confident conclusions can be drawn about the value of TCMHs for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-17 15:40:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-21 14:27:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Haemorrhoids is a common disease but the etiological factors are still not completely clarified. The haemorrhoids are divided into three types according to the anocutaneous site: internal, external or mixed haemorrhoids. The incidence of haemorrhoids increases by age and 60% to 80% of adults will have some degree of discomfort from them (<LINK REF="REF-An-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">An 1998</LINK>). Symptoms of haemorrhoids vary. Some haemorrhoids are only identified upon anorectal examination (<LINK REF="REF-An-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">An 1998</LINK>), whereas others give symptoms, such as bleeding after defecation, pain in the anal area, perianal inflammation, perianal venous prolapse or incarceration and pruritus ani. The main viewpoint is that haemorrhoids are caused mainly by anal pulvinus pathological hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-An-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">An 1998</LINK>) and perianal varicosis (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1995</LINK>). Anatomical examinations show that there are many arteriovenous anastomoses and venous lacuna-changes, telangiectases and, furthermore, many of the blood vessels are full of thromboses (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1990</LINK>). Other researchers report that haemorrhoids are caused by hypertension of the anal cushions (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 1992</LINK>) and constipation and anal hypertonia also play an important role in the onset of haemorrhoids (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional therapeutic strategies of western medicine include surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 2001</LINK>) as well as non-surgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2002</LINK>). To alleviate some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids, such as haematochezia or pain in the anal area, oral medicines such as fibre supplements and oral diosmin (Daflon), has been given to patients. Other non-surgical treatments, such as infrared photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Dimitroulopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimitroulopoulos 2005</LINK>), injection sclerotherapy and rubber band ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Dennison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennison 1989</LINK>) are used to fixate the haemorrhoidal cushion when the efficacy of the medicine is too weak. And finally, if non-surgical treatment is without any effect surgical haemorrhoidectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Mikubi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikubi 2004</LINK>) is used.<BR/>
</P>
<P>According to the Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) theory (pathogenesis), haemorrhoids are caused by imbalance of Yin and Yang and influenced by six climatic conditions in an excess of pathogenic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Zhong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhong 2006</LINK>), such as wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness and fire. Overall, these factors have a negative impact on human emotions, including joy, anger, melancholy, anxiety, grief and fear. The clinical manifestation consists of a large accumulation of intestinal heat continuing to diarrhoea, deficiency of qi and blood, collapse of qi etc.</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese Medicinal Herbs (TCMHs) have been used for the treatment of haemorrhoids for many years. Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, Flos Carthami, Flos Lonicerae, Portulaca Oleracea L (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2007</LINK>), Baikal skullcap root, Chinese nut-gall, Bitter orange (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>), Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Rehmanniae Praeparata, Rhizaoma Ligustici Chuanxiong, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Radix Sanguisorbae and Herba Agrimoniae (<LINK REF="REF-An-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">An 1998</LINK>) have all showed beneficial effects in the treatment of haemorrhoid symptoms such as bleeding, incarceration, inflammation etc. Bleeding, which is mainly caused by internal haemorrhoids, can be evoked repeatedly by many factors such as constipation, pungent food etc. In TCM, some herbs, such as Galla Chinensis or Borneolum (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1999</LINK>), are added to the main recipes for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids.</P>
<P>Although a number of trials, clinical case reports, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Senapati-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senapati 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Miranda-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Miranda 1996</LINK>) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) (quasi-RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2002</LINK>), have reported on the effects of medical herbs in the treatment of symptoms from haemorrhoids (beneficial as well as adverse effects), the quality of these studies have not been assessed systematically.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-07-21 12:05:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following bibliographic databases in order to identify relevant trials: Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Contolled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CMCD (Chinese Medicine Conference Disc) and CBMD (Chinese Bio-Medicine Disc) (1966 to August 2009). We used text words combined with MeSH terms: haematochezia, haemorrhoids, plies, bleeding, medicine-Chinese-traditional, plants-medical, drugs-Chinese-herbal, plants extracts and herbs (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for more details).</P>
<P>We searched the following journals for relevant studies from the first publication date onwards: Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine of Zhejiang (1991 to August, 2009), Chinese Journal of Being University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (1980 to August 2009), Chinese Surgical Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (1994 to August 2009) and the Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (1980 to August 2009). Conference proceedings that were not published in journals, such as Chinese Anorectal Conference proceedings, and the main Chinese journals about TCMHs for haemorrhoids were handsearched; other RCTs about TCMHs for haemorrhoids were registered if we could obtain them.<BR/>If information or data were missing in the trial report, we corresponded with the principal investigator of the relevant study.</P>

<LI>generation of the allocation sequence, adequate (computer generated random numbers or similar) or inadequate (other methods, or not described);</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment, adequate (central independent unit, sealed envelopes, or similar) or inadequate (not described, or open table of random numbers, or similar);</LI>
<LI>double blinding, adequate (identical placebo tablets, or similar) or inadequate (not performed, or tablets versus injections, or similar);</LI>
<LI>follow up, six months at least, adequate (number and reasons for drop-outs and withdrawals described) or inadequate (number or reasons for drop-outs and withdrawals not described).</LI>

<P>Further, we recorded if the trials reported whether intention-to-treat analysis was used or not (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Extraction of data</HEADING>
<P>We extracted and reported data on specially developed forms. Extraction was undertaken by one review author (Liu Y) and checked by a second (Yang J). Data entry into RevMan was also double checked.</P>
<P>The following characteristics were recorded for each trial.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Details of the participants including demographic characteristics, source of recruitment, criteria for diagnosis and haemorrhoid symptoms on presentation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were categorised according to the intervention measures (Type I, II) and the most prevalent type of haemorrhoid symptoms, such as haematochezia, pain in the anal area, perianal inflammation, perianal venous prolapse or incarceration, pruritus ani etc.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Details of the experimental and control interventions including intervention type, names of the medicinal herbs, dosages and schedules, included where available and appropriate.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>No meta-analysis or subgroup analyses.<BR/>All analyses are performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, including all randomised patients. Patients without the outcome variable were considered failures ('worst case scenario analysis' carried out).<BR/>For binary outcomes, such as the presence or absence of symptoms, the impact of the intervention was expressed as relative risks together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations was used to summarise the value in each group. Weighted mean difference or standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes were used depending on whether the continuous data used the same scale or not. We were to conduct all meta-analyses by both the random-effects model and the fixed-effect model. However, we only reported the results of the random-effects model analyses unless the results of the two models differed (one significant, the other insignificant). In the latter case we reported both model analyses. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (or Fischer's exact test) or Students' t-test were conducted (SPSS 13.0 Version) in the included trials because the difference of intervention measures used impeded the pooling of the binary or continuous data in a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Our primary search (August 2009) resulted in 52 articles after scanning the contents and abstracts. Of these, 17 articles were selected in accordance with the objectives of this review. Eight of these 17 articles were then excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion are listed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The remaining nine articles, which were all of parallel RCTs (1822 patients involved), were finally selected for further appraisal. No cross-over trials were found. In the included trials four kinds of patent herbal medicines were used in the intervention group, that is Zhixue capsule, Zhixueheji, Fuhuang tablets, and Callicarpa Nudiflora tablet. These were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies. There were treatments with 45 different medicinal herbs (dosage varying from 10 g to 30 g) compared with various control interventions (five different compound preparations of medicinal herbs in five trials (Type I) with five different western medicines in four trials as comparators (Type II)) as listed below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Design</HEADING>
<P>The nine articles were subdivided into the following two types of intervention measures (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>): herbs in the intervention group<I> </I>versus herbs in the control group (type I in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (five trials); herbs in the intervention group versus western medicines in the control group (type II in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (four reports). No randomised clinical trial used the comparison of a single herb with another single herb.</P>
<P>1. Type I (herbs versus herbs): of the five type I trials, three trials reported the specific method of random allocation of the patients with bleeding haemorrhoids (n = 710) to the Chinese medicinal herbs or the control group. The controls, or comparators, in all five trials were four kinds of patent medicinal herbs: Huaijiao Pill in two trials; and Zhikang tablet, Zhining tablet and Zhichuang tablet in one trial each. Three kinds of patent herbal medicine were used as the intervention measure: Zhixueheji and Zhixue capsule in two trials each; and Fuhuang tablet in one trial. The therapeutic period varied from 7 to 45 days: four trials of 7 days and one of 45 days. For details, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>2. Type II (herbs versus western medicines): of the four type II trials, one article reported the specific method of random allocation of the patients with bleeding haemorrhoids (n = 1112) to the Chinese medicinal herb or the control group. The control groups were given five different western medicines: adrenosem as a comparator in four trials; vitamin C and vitamin k<SUB>4 </SUB>in one trial each; and norfloxacin and cefradine in one trial each, without specific dosages provided. One patent herb medicine (Callicarpa Nudiflora tablet) and three kinds of self-produced herbal decoctions were used in the intervention group. The therapeutic period varied from five to 14 days. For details, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials reported sample size calculation. In type I trials, the sample size varied from 48 to 298 cases (mean 142 cases); in type II trials, the sample size varied from 131 to 440 cases (mean 388 cases).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Both inpatients and the outpatients were included for the review. In type I: one trial included both inpatients and outpatients, another just included outpatients, the other three trials did not specify the status of the patients. In type II: one trial included both inpatients and outpatients, two trials included outpatients only, and one article did not specify the status of the patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All the trials included adult patients aged from 17 to 87 years. All included male and female patients except for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2004</LINK>), which only included female patients. Seven trials included patients with internal haemorrhoids and mixed haemorrhoids, two trials of type I and one trial of type II did not state the status of the haemorrhoids (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The diagnostic criteria were based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) criteria for bleeding haemorrhoids, promulgated by the Chinese Hygiene Ministry. Exclusion of patients from the trials was based on the following criteria.</P>
<P>(1) Patients with haemorrhoids that were not bleeding.</P>
<P>(2) Pregnant female patients.</P>
<P>(3) Patients with severe basal idiopathy, such as angiocardiopathy, nephropathy, hepatopathy and psychosis.</P>
<P>(4) Patients without therapy compliance.</P>
<P>The baseline comparability was consistent in the intervention group and the control group in accordance with the randomisation principle.</P>
<P>The overall ratio of male patients to female patients was almost 1:1. In type I, the participants were aged from 22 years to 65 years in four trials; no ages were reported in the last trial. In type II, the participants were aged 17 years to 87 years in all four trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The intervention measures (Traditional Chinese Medicinal herbs, TCMHs) consisted of the patent herbal medicine or the self-produced herbal compound, often including seven to 15 kinds of herbs (listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), but some authors did not specify the dosage of the herbs due to commercial or technological secrets. In the nine trials, the most commonly used herbs (frequency &gt; 30%) were: Radix Sanguisorbae, 66.7% (6/9); Radix Rehmanniae, 55.6% (5/9); Fructus Sophorae, 55.6% (5/9); Radix Angelicae Sinensis, 44.4% (4/9); Radix Scutellariae, 44.4% (4/9); Cacumen Biotae, 44.4% (4/9); Cortex Phellodendri, 33.3% (3/9); Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, 33.3% (3/9); and Radix Astragali seu Hedysari, 33.3% (3/9). The medicinal herbs used in the intervention groups and the control group were different in each trial (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details). Therefore we could not carry out a meaningful subgroup analysis on the herbs, or pool the trial data in ar meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The commonly reported outcomes included the total grade of symptoms or general curative effect and the improvement of symptoms, which was obtained by the comprehensive effectiveness evaluation on the four symptoms before and after the treatment (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Improvements of the specific conditions were also evaluated, such as haematochezia (bleeding episodes), number of congested haemorrhoidal cushion, haemorrhoidal prolapse, haemorrhoids bleeding on contact, pain in the anal area, perianal inflammation, and pruritus ani. Adverse effects were reported in some trials.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-07-21 13:06:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials was weak because most of the published trials did not give complete information for a formal assessment of their quality (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). All included trials used randomisation but most of them did not specify the methods of randomisation and allocation of the allocation sequence, except one trial (11.1%) which described the method of generating the allocation sequence by the random numbers in SPSS software (<LINK REF="STD-He-2006" TYPE="STUDY">He 2006</LINK>). Only two trials reported that blinding was used (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2005</LINK>). None of the trials described the specific method for the allocation concealment. Two trials mentioned the withdrawal or dropout of patients, including the reasons for withdrawal or dropouts (Perez-Miranda 1996a; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2005</LINK>). No RCT stated that an intention-to-treat analysis had been used to evaluate the data; only one trial (11.1%) (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2004</LINK>) reported that patients in the intervention group were followed up for two to six months. </P>
<P>The specific data were listed as follows.</P>
<P>1. Type I (herbs versus herbs): of these five trials, only one trial (20%) (<LINK REF="STD-He-2006" TYPE="STUDY">He 2006</LINK>) described the method of generating the allocation sequence, by the random number table; two trials (40%) used blinding methods (single blind in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2005</LINK>), double blind in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>)) during the period of intervention; no trials gave information of follow up. The relevant details are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>2. Type II (herbs versus western medicines): of these four trials, none of them described the specific randomisation method or allocation sequence generation, and blinding methods were not used. Only one trial carried out follow up in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2004</LINK>). The relevant details are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-21 14:16:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some surgery interventions, such as rubber band ligation, are the most common treatment for bleeding haemorrhoids in the world, but this measure cannot completely prevent the relapse of bleeding haemorrhoids. The theory of TCM, which is quite different from western surgical treatment, aims at a conservative solution for haemorrhoids. The concoctions of TCM, or other western medicines, are given first if a patient is diagnosed with bleeding haemorrhoids, thus the rubber band ligation is not a preferred therapeutic method. So, in our investigation we could not provide information from RCTs of the rubber band ligation method as a comparator to Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs (TCMH) because no relevant RCTs were found in the common medical databases listed in this review.</P>
<P>It should be emphasized that TCM has a concept of 'principal, adjuvant, auxiliary and conductive ingredients' in clinical practice. A herb is seldom used alone for its single effect. The effect of TCMHs used in the concoctions mentioned in the review is not for the effect of 'lubrication, anti-inflammatory, vasoconstrictor, etc.', but for 'Balance, Yin, Yang, Cold, Heat' (TCM jargon) of the human body. A variety of herbs are used together to increase the effectiveness of the treatment and reduce toxicity of the herbs. Different single herb can have a similar effect, but the additive effect occurs when the different herbs are mixed. So, the disease can be cured more quickly if some different herbs with a similar effect are combined. However, it is difficult to determine which concoction is a preferred therapy in TCM because different herbs can have different actions on the different parts of the body in the different stages of a disease. According to the TCM theory, bleeding haemorrhoids occur in the human body mostly caused by Damp-Heat syndrome (TCM jargon), so some herbs can be used to eliminate damp and h eat in the patient's viscera.</P>
<P>The herbs involved in this review were Radix Sanguisorbae, Gardenia, Radix Scutellariae, Fructus Sophorae, Cacumen Biotae, Radix Rehmanniae, Cortex Dictamni, and Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, etc. In the TCM field, Radix Sanguisorbae has an effect of cooling the blood to stop bleeding and sore detoxification convergence, which can cure hemafecia or blood from haemorrhoids. Gardenia has an effect of purging pathogenic Fire (TCM jargon). Cacumen Biotae has an effect of curing emptysis, haematuria and haemafecia. Radix Scutellariae (charring) has an effect of clearing heat, drying dampness, purging pathogenic fire,and detoxification. Radix Rehmanniae has an effect of clearing Heat, cooling blood, and nourishing Yin to promote the production of the body fluid. All the herbs after charring can be used to cool the blood to stop bleeding from haemorrhoids.</P>
<P>Research of its pharmacology showed that Radix Sanguisorbae, which contains tannin, can be used as an astringent and can reduce the bleeding time (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). Cacumen Biotae can also be used to significantly reduce the bleeding and the clotting time (<LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2008</LINK>). Radix Scutellariae, which contains glucoside, can inhibit hyper-permeability of the mouse ear capillary caused by experimental inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2009</LINK>). Radix Rehmanniae can not only promote platelet production but can also improve symptoms of anaemia caused by heavy bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009</LINK>). Fructus Sophorae<B> </B>in the TCM concoctions has an effect of clearing Heat, purging pathogenic Fire and cooling the blood to stop bleeding. The modern pharmacology research has indicated that Fructus Sophorae can promote blood coagulation and reduce the permeability of the blood vessel wall because it contains glucosides (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>As Damp-Heat is the most common pathologic factor for haemorrhoids in the TCM practice, bleeding haemorrhoids can be cured by eliminating damp and heat. Cortex Dictamni has obvious effects of both clearing heat and drying dampness, and Radix Sophorae Flavescentis can help increase the effectiveness of clearing heat and drying dampness. Modern pharmacology in mice also proved that Cortex Dictamni and Radix Sophorae Flavescentis can reduce the bleeding and the clotting time (<LINK REF="REF-Gao-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gao 1999</LINK>), and can reduce the activated partial thromboplastin time, the thrombin time, and the prothrombin time as well (<LINK REF="REF-Mo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mo 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the recipe used in TCM for TCMHs in haemorrhoids has identified some herbs, such as Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophorae, Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Scutellariae, Cacumen Biotae, Cortex Phellodendri etc., the effectiveness of TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids still needs further confirmation in additional trials.</P>
<P>Nine trials involving 1822 patients with bleeding haemorrhoids were identified for inclusion in this review, however, most of them were not of high quality, and used TCMHs compared with another concoction of TCMHs (Type I) (five trials) or western medicines (Type II) (four trials). Therefore, we could not pool any of the results from the trials for meta-analyses because only two trials used the same intervention or comparison. Of the nine trials, TCMHs showed statistically significant differences in the improvement of the general curative effects or total grade of symptoms in six trials, haematochezia in four trials, congestive haemorrhoidal cushions in one trial, inflammation of perianal mucosa in one trial; adverse effects were not serious and infrequent.</P>
<P>A standard, generally accepted formula of TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids was not screened out, though some herbs, such as Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophora etc., were used more frequently.</P>
<P>Though the results implied that someTCMHs may have some general curative effects for bleeding haemorrhoids, and lead to fewer adverse or side effects compared with the medicines used in the CP, it is still too early to draw any conclusion that the TCMHs have definitive curative effects for bleeding haemorrhoids. This is due to the small number of trials, the lack of meta-analyses and the methodological limitations of the data from the trials. Information on allocation concealment and follow up have not been provided adequately either. If possible, all of the primary data should be available for further analyses, regardless of the positive or negative conclusions of the clinical trials. The RCTs should be designed strictly using the same medicine, same dosage, same therapeutic course in the IP or CP in order to analyse the results using stronger statistical methods, for example meta-analysis. When including patients with different levels of illness (grade of symptoms), stratified randomisation should be used in the trials. At the same time, the method of allocation concealment for clinical trials should be clarified by the authors. In the nine included studies only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-He-2006" TYPE="STUDY">He 2006</LINK>) mentioned that the random numbers from the SPSS software were used. Thus, another important mission in the TCMHs research field for bleeding haemorrhoids is to modify the current reporting practices of the study authors. Even if the method of allocation concealment or other relevant facts are clear to a certain extent, they should be elucidated completely in the literature for the purpose of further analysis.</P>
<P>In order to obtain curative effects in the long term, the classical therapeutic intervention measures for bleeding haemorrhoids, especially for recurrent or serious cases, are a surgical operation (<LINK REF="REF-Lorenzo_x002d_Rivero-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenzo-Rivero 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pakravan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakravan 2009;</LINK>) or minimally invasive treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorenzo_x002d_Rivero-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenzo-Rivero 2009</LINK>) such as local injection sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Alatise-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alatise 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohning-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohning 2009</LINK>) and rubber band ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Forlini-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forlini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jutabha-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jutabha 2009</LINK>). TCMHs could be chosen as an adjuvant therapy to alleviate the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2008</LINK>), such as haematochezia, inflammation of perianal mucosa, etc., before the intervention mentioned above. However, the obvious limitation of TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids at present is that all the clinical practice has focused on the short-term research without long-term follow up. No surgical or minimally invasive intervention, which may acquire long-term efficacy for bleeding haemorrhoids, was chosen as the active comparator in the CP. Thus, no trials about TCMHs were identified for the appraisal of long-term efficacy.</P>
<P>Nine trials were all designed as equivalence trials and no placebo-controlled trial was carried out. Some researchers believe their self-made formulae of TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids to be more effective than some patent medicine of TCMHs, so over half of the trials (five trials in type I group) chose the commonly used patent medicine of TCMHs in China as the active comparator in the CP. Other relevant reviews or literature about TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids (<LINK REF="REF-Luo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2000</LINK>) and TCMHs for haemorrhoids without bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2008</LINK>)<B> </B>showed that TCMHs may alleviate the symptoms from haemorrhoids, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions. More studies with high quality and large numbers of participants are needed for further investigation.</P>

<P>This review did not provide strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. Most of the included studies were of low quality and there was a scarcity of eligible trials and numbers of participants. Limited, weak evidence showed that some formulae, when including Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophorae, Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Scutellariae etc., may alleviate some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids, such as hematochezia, congestive haemorrhoidal cushions, inflammation of perianal mucosa, in the short term. No serious adverse sides were reported. There is no evidence to support the long-term efficacy of TCMHs for bleeding haemorrhoids, and well-designed clinical trials are required urgently before any confident conclusions can be drawn about the value of TCMHs for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids.</P>
<P>At present, the general evidence is not enough to imply that clinical practice should be changed immediately on the basis of these results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-21 14:26:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standardised formulae of TCMHs and the comparators should be developed and used for bleeding haemorrhoids in China. Data from large, randomised, double blinded, multicentre trials are required to confirm the curative effects and safety of TCMHs for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. More important, two obvious studies are needed to assess the best TCM versus placebo and the best TCM versus rubber band ligation. It will be very hard to draw conclusions about the efficacy of TCM until these studies are done. These trials should use standardised outcome measures for short and long-term efficacy, and should include an assessment of adverse events. All the trials should also provide adequate follow-up periods so that long-term efficacy and safety may be appraised.</P>
