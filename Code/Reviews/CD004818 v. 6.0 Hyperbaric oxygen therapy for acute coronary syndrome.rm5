<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-06 15:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute heart attacks and severe angina (heart pain) are usually due to blockages in the arteries supplying the heart (coronary arteries). These problems are collectively referred to as 'acute coronary syndrome' (ACS). ACS is very common and may lead to severe complications including death. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves people breathing pure oxygen at high pressures in a specially designed chamber. It is sometimes used as a treatment to increase the supply of oxygen to the damaged heart in an attempt to reduce the area of the heart that is at risk of dying.</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature for any studies that reported the outcome of patients with ACS when treated with HBOT.</P>
<P>
<B>Studies found</B>
</P>
<P>We first searched the literature in 2004 and most recently in September 2014, finding 6 studies in total. All studies included patients with heart attack and some also included patients with severe angina. The dose of hyperbaric oxygen was similar in most studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we found some evidence that people with ACS are less likely to die or to have major adverse events, and to have more rapid relief from their pain if they receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy as part of their treatment. However, our conclusions are based on relatively small randomised trials. Our confidence in these findings is further reduced because in most of these studies both the patients and researchers were aware of who was receiving HBOT and it is possible a 'placebo effect' has biased the result in favour of HBOT. HBOT was generally well-tolerated. Some patients complained of claustrophobia when treated in small (single person) chambers and there was no evidence of important toxicity from oxygen breathing in any subject. One individual suffered damage to the eardrum from pressurisation. </P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>While HBOT may reduce the risk of dying, time to pain relief and the chance of adverse heart events in people with heart attack and unstable angina, more work is needed to be sure that HBOT should be recommended. <BR/>

<P>Three authors independently evaluated the quality of trials using the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook and extracted data from included trials.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:40:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new trials were located in our most recent search in September 2014. Six trials with 665 participants contributed to this review. These trials were small and subject to potential bias. Only two reported randomisation procedures in detail and in only one trial was allocation concealed. While only modest numbers of participants were lost to follow-up, in general there is little information on the longer-term outcome for participants. Patients with acute coronary syndrome allocated to HBOT were associated with a reduction in the risk of death by around 42% (RR: 0.58, (95% CI 0.36 to 0.92), 5 trials, 614 participants; low quality evidence).</P>
<P>In general, HBOT was well-tolerated. No patients were reported as suffering neurological oxygen toxicity and only a single patient was reported to have significant barotrauma to the tympanic membrane. One trial suggested a significant incidence of claustrophobia in single occupancy chambers of 15% (RR of claustrophobia with HBOT 31.6, 95% CI 1.92 to 521).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-08 13:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>For people with ACS, there is some evidence from small trials to suggest that HBOT is associated with a reduction in the risk of death, the volume of damaged muscle, the risk of MACE and time to relief from ischaemic pain. In view of the modest number of patients, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting, this result should be interpreted cautiously, and an appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is justified to define those patients (if any) who can be expected to derive most benefit from HBOT. The routine application of HBOT to these patients cannot be justified from this review.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-06 15:38:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world, accounting for 30% of all deaths, of which 42% are due to coronary heart disease (CHD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, CVD is the most common cause of premature death, causing just over 159,000 deaths, approximately 25% of all deaths episodes in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-BHF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHF 2012</LINK>). Of these deaths, nearly 74,000 were due to CHD at a community cost of around GBP 1.8 billion in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Nichols-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichols 2012</LINK>). Since myocardial infarction (the presence of two out of three of: chest pain, ECG changes and cardiac enzyme rise) is not always diagnosable during an acute event, unstable or persisting ischaemic heart pain (angina) with or without infarction are together described as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The main underlying problems in coronary heart disease is atherosclerosis, a degenerative process characterised by the formation of plaques comprised of platelets, cells, matrix fibres, lipids, and tissue debris in the vessel lumen. While such plaques are often complicated by ulceration of the vessel wall with obstruction to blood flow, such ulceration is not necessary for plaques to be problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Naghavi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naghavi 2003</LINK>). An unstable plaque (coronary atheroma vulnerable to rupture and fissure, and associated with thrombus formation) can lead to an acute coronary syndrome without the artery being totally occluded and infarction may follow (<LINK REF="REF-Heistad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heistad 2003</LINK>). A significant proportion of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will suffer major morbidity or mortality, even when thrombolysis or angioplasty is used to relieve the obstruction, although there is some evidence that the rate of inhospital events and six-month readmissions are falling with increasing adherence to evidence-based guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Kalla-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalla 2006</LINK>; Aliprandi-Costa 2011).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:21:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an adjunctive therapy that has been proposed to improve outcome following ACS. HBOT is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than one atmosphere absolute (ATA), and involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. At 2 ATA, for example, patients with reasonable cardiopulmonary function will have an arterial oxygen tension of over 1000 mmHg, and a muscle oxygen tension around 221mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Sheffield-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffield 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1977</LINK>). In comparison, muscle oxygen tension on air at 1ATA is about 29 mmHg and 59mmHg breathing 100% oxygen at 1ATA. Indeed, at 3ATA on 100% oxygen, there are more than 6 mls of oxygen dissolved in every 100 mls of plasma, enough to sustain basal metabolic requirements without any oxygen transport by haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Boerema-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boerema 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammarlund-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarlund 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1998</LINK>). However 3ATA of 100% oxygen becomes rapidly toxic in the brain, manifested in epileptiform grand mal seizures. Therefore in practice, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 2.8 ATA for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or more daily.</P>
<P>HBOT for ACS was first reported in a canine experimental model in 1958 (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1958</LINK>) and in a human subject in 1964 (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 1964</LINK>). Several uncontrolled human studies have been published since that time, generally with indications of benefit measured as a reduction in mortality or improvements in haemodynamic or metabolic parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Ashfield-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashfield 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kline-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kline 1970</LINK>). As far as the authors are aware, however, HBOT is not in routine use anywhere for patients presenting with ACS.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-06 15:38:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The administration of HBOT is based on the argument that the myocardium is hypoxic, and that HBOT can reverse that hypoxia in areas that are marginally perfused. This effect is achieved by greatly increasing the diffusion gradient down which oxygen moves from the blood to the myocyte. Improved oxygen availability may also improve outcome through the effects of oxygen as a modulator of tissue repair. Oxygen has been shown to increase the expression of antioxidant enzymes in both tissues and plasma through an increase in glutathione levels (<LINK REF="REF-Harabin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harabin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speit 2000</LINK>), to reduce the degree of lipid peroxidation (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1991</LINK>) and to prevent the activation of neutrophils in response to endothelial damage, thus modifying ischaemia-reperfusion injury (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tjarnstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tjarnstrom 1999</LINK>). HBOT also mobilises stem cells from the bone marrow in a dose-dependent manner and may be important in neovascularisation of healing tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Heyboer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyboer 2014</LINK>). The induction of protective mechanisms via a degree of oxidative stress is probably the common factor for many of these beneficial effects (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2009</LINK>). However despite more than 40 years of interest in the delivery of HBOT relatively little clinical evidence exists for the assertion that such an intervention improves outcome.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:25:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge, there are no other systematic reviews of the clinical use of HBOT for ACS, and it is important to clearly assess both the risks and benefits of this treatment. While HBOT may produce benefit for the myocardium via the mechanisms outlined above, HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 2008</LINK>), temporary worsening of short-sightedness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>), claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1998</LINK>). Reported rates vary widely but, for example, about 20% of patients will experience some degree of middle ear barotrauma, and 60% to 70% a measurable worsening of short-sightedness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shupak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 2008</LINK>). Oxygen poisoning may occur acutely in the form of grand mal seizures while exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (acute neurological toxicity), or develop over the course of treatment, resulting in a reversible reduction in vital capacity and other respiratory indices (pulmonary oxygen toxicity) (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>). In addition, the occurrence of significant post-infarction events such as malignant arrhythmia, might be associated with a worse prognosis if they arise while the patient is confined in a hyperbaric chamber. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Leach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1998</LINK>). For a number of reasons, therefore, the administration of HBOT for acute coronary syndrome patients remains controversial.</P>

The secondary citations for these studies are listed in <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>. The six included trials were published between 1973 and 2007 and from a wide range of geographical locations (USA: Long Beach California <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK> and Cleveland Ohio <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK>; Russia: Minsk <LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK>; The Balkans: Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro <LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK>; England: London <LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK> and Australia: Fremantle <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK>). None of the trials declared any industry funding, although <LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK> declared the chamber manufacturer loaned his group the hyperbaric chambers used. The authors of this review are unaware of any ongoing RCTs in the area. In total, the six trials enrolled 665 participants, 337 receiving HBOT and 328 control. The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK>) accounts for 33% of cases. (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>All studies involved the administration of 100% oxygen at between 2ATA and 3ATA for between 30 and 120 minutes, however the total number of treatment sessions varied between studies. The lowest number administered was a single session (<LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK>), while the highest was a maximum of 16 treatments within 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials included participants with acute myocardial infarction and <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK> also included individuals presenting with unstable angina. All trials included patients with similar age and sex distribution (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK> described allocation concealment and blinded subjects to allocation with a sham HBOT session. The time from presentation to enrolment varied from "up to ten days" (<LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK>), "within one week" (<LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK>) to "within 24 hours" (<LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK>) and "within six hours" (<LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK>).

The primary purpose of five of these reports was the treatment of AMI with HBOT (<LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK> was aimed at the prevention of further AMI rather than acute treatment), while for <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK> it was the use of HBOT in AMI patients to identify myocardial segments capable of functional improvement, and for <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK> the effect of HBOT on re-stenosis following percutaneous coronary interventions. Specific exclusion criteria varied between trials. All trials excluded those unfit for HBOT, but in addition <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK> excluded subjects who were not suitable for thrombolysis (e.g. recent stroke), those with previous AMI and those in cardiogenic shock, while <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK> excluded those with uncontrolled heart failure and/or significant ongoing angina. <LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK> excluded subjects over 70 years and those presenting when there was no HBOT chamber available. <LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK> also excluded patients over 70 or with heart failure, significant dysrhythmia or no definitive diagnosis of AMI. <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK> excluded those who continued to show evidence of ischaemia after 30 minutes of medical treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK> only enrolled patients more than three days after AMI.</P>
<P>Comparator therapies also varied between trials. All trials employed HBOT as an adjunctive procedure to "standard" care: <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK> used thrombolysis, aspirin, heparin and intravenous nitroglycerine in suitable patients, <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK> employed stenting and a regimen using aspirin, heparin and clopidogrel, <LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK> used thrombolysis, while <LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK> used "full orthodox care" and <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK> used "customary care".</P>
<P>The follow-up periods varied between the period immediately following HBOT (<LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK>), to three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK>), six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dekleva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dekleva 2004</LINK>) eight months (<LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK>) and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK> reported mortality to discharge from hospital. All included studies reported at least one clinical outcome of interest.

Subgroup analysis suggested no significant difference between treatment groups for those in cardiogenic shock (RR with cardiogenic shock 0.61 95% CI 0.32 to 1.18, P = 0.15, but a benefit in those without cardiogenic shock (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.98, P = 0.0.04). There was no indication of significant heterogeneity between trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Despite the result of the pooled analysis, the absolute risk difference (by simple &#1061;<SUP>2</SUP> analysis) of 4.3% between control and HBOT is not statistically significant (P = 0.07), with an NNT to avoid one extra death of 24, (95% CI 259 in favour of control to 12 in favour of HBOT).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Major Adverse Coronary Events (MACE) (Analysis 2.1)</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK>), involving 61 patients (9% of the total subjects in this review), with 24 (39%) analysed as receiving standard therapy with HBOT, and 37 (61%) standard therapy alone. One subject (4.2%) suffered with a MACE following HBOT versus 13 subjects (35.1%) in the control group. There was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of MACE following HBOT (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.85, P = 0.03). This result was however, sensitive to the allocation of withdrawals (best case RR of death with HBOT is 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61, P = 0.01, worst case RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.40, P = 0.22). The absolute risk difference of 30.9% between sham and HBOT is significant (P=0.005), with an NNT to avoid one extra MACE of 4, (95% CI 3 to 10).</P>
<P>One trial reported the incidence of recurrent acute myocardial infarction (RAMI) at two years rather than MACE (<LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK>), and it was not clear if this included all those who died during the study period. We have therefore reported this outcome separately. This trial included 129 patients (19% of the total subjects in this review), with 65 (50.4%) allocated to control and 64 (49.6%) to HBOT. Three subjects (4.7%) suffered with a RAMI following HBOT versus 11 subjects (16.9%) in the control group.There was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of RAMI following HBOT (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.95, P = 0.04). This result was however, sensitive to the allocation of withdrawals (best case RR of death with HBOT is 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.55, P = 0.0003, worst case RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.02, P = 0.84). The absolute risk difference of 12.2% between sham and HBOT is significant (P = 0.03), with an NNT to avoid one extra MACE of 8, (95% CI 4 to 61).</P>

Of the events recorded, three dysrhythmias were accepted as 'significant cardiac events' - complete heart block, ventricular fibrillation and asystole. It is not clear if the numbers reported reflect individuals who suffered these events, or the number of events in total.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:33:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has included data from six trials investigating the treatment of ACS with HBOT, and we believe these represent all randomised human trials in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of searching. One trial included subjects with ACS, while five included only subjects with confirmed myocardial infarction. </P>
<P>Pooled data for clinical outcomes of interest were performed with respect to the risk of death, cardiac enzyme peak levels, left ventricular function and adverse effects. CPK rose significantly less following HBOT (MD 493 IU, P = 0.005), implying a smaller volume of infarction, and LVEF was better following HBOT (MD 5.5%, P = 0.001) . The clinical and functional significance of these differences is not clear. The risk of dying was significantly better following HBOT, (RR 0.58, P = 0.02) and the absolute risk difference of 4.3% suggested an NNT of around 24 patients in order to avoid one death by the addition of HBOT. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK>) reported the fate of those presenting in cardiogenic shock, and while there was no statistically significant difference between groups in this small sample, it is worth noting that all survivors were from the HBOT group (three from seven subjects versus none from five). The one small study that reported MACE rather than death alone (<LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2004</LINK>) also suggested better outcome with the use of HBOT (RR 0.12, P = 0.03) with a risk difference of 31% and an NNT of 4. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK> reported a significant reduction in the chance of re-infarction with the administration of HBOT (RR 0.28, P = 0.04) with a risk difference of 12..2% and an NNT of 8. These possible treatment effects would be of great clinical importance and deserve further investigation. </P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-06 15:40:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only six trials with 665 participants were available for evaluation using our planned comparisons, and meta-analysis was not appropriate or possible for a number of these. The evidence is therefore very incomplete and cannot be applied directly to routine clinical care for patients with acute coronary syndrome.</P>
<P>These trials were published over a 24-year period up to 2007, and from a wide geographical area. We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to inclusion or otherwise of thrombolysis, the nature of comparator treatments, dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course), the presence or absence of cardiac failure, the site of infarct, and to compare those with established versus pre-infarct subjects. However, the paucity of eligible trials and poor reporting suggested these analyses would not be informative. Patient inclusion criteria were not standard, and poorly reported in some trials. Only <LINK REF="STD-Hot-MI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hot MI 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dotsenko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dotsenko 2007</LINK> clearly indicated the time at which the inclusion criteria were applied. There was significant variation both in oxygen dose during an individual treatment session, and in the number of sessions administered to each patient. While all trials used some form of 'standard' cardiac therapy in a dedicated unit designed to maximise outcome, these comparator therapies were generally poorly described and could not form the basis for a meaningful subgroup analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-21 15:40:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As well as carrying little statistical power, other problems for this review were the variable methodological quality of many of these trials, differences in entry criteria and the nature and timing of outcomes, and poor reporting of both outcomes and methodology. In particular, there is a possibility of bias due to different anatomical locations and extent of myocardial damage on entry to these small trials, as well as from non-blinded management decisions in all except <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1992</LINK>. Further, we could only pool the data for two of our outcomes of interest given little commonality between the outcomes reported in these trials.</P>
<P>For the primary outcomes, only a single trial clearly recorded all major adverse copronary events (MACE) and we were unable to calculate a pooled estimate of the effect of allocation to receive HBOT. For the risk of death following acute cortonary syndrome, our estmate is that patients allocated to HBOT were associated with a reduction in the risk of death by around 42% (RR: 0.58, (95% CI 0.36 to 0.92). This estimate was derived from only five trials including 614 subjects and the GRADE approach rates this evidence as of low quality following downgrading because this critical outcome had a low incidence in this small group of patients.</P>
<P>For our secondary outcomes, we could pool only the maximum plasma creatine phosphate (CPK) for two trials. Using the GRADE approach, the evidence for lower CPK associated with patients who received HBOT was rated as high. </P>
<P>As is common with small trials, the incidence of adverse effects was poorly assessed by the studies included in this review. No trial reported any neurological or pulmonary oxygen toxicity in any group, while there was only one reported case of severe ear barotrauma as a consequence of compression. <LINK REF="STD-Thurston-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Thurston 1973</LINK> reported 15 individuals who needed to be removed from a single occupancy hyperbaric chamber because of claustrophobia, a rate of 15%. While this is a clinically significant problem in that trial, it is unlikely this rate would be sustained when using larger compression chambers designed for multiple occupancy. There are a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly. Visual disturbance, usually reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported - perhaps as many as 50% of those having a course of 30 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). While the great majority of patients recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, a small proportion of patients continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. None of the trials included in this review reported visual changes. The second most common adverse effect associated with HBOT is middle-ear barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Ear barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and usually requires active effort by the patient in order to inflate the middle ear through the eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly, but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Most episodes of barotrauma are mild, easily treated or recover spontaneously and do not require the therapy to be abandoned.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-24 11:53:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>There is some evidence from this review that HBOT following an episode of ACS reduces the risk of death, re-infarction, significant dysrhythmias and MACE, as well as limiting the peak levels of CPK and improving left ventricular ejection fraction. HBOT may also reduce the time required to achieve relief from cardiac ischaemic pain in these patients. The small number of studies, the modest numbers of patients, and the methodological and reporting inadequacies of the primary studies included in this review demand a cautious interpretation. Thus, the routine adjunctive use of HBOT in these patients cannot be justified by this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the indicative findings of improved outcomes with the use of HBOT in these patients, there is a case for large randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit (if any) from the administration of HBOT. Specifically, more information is required on the subset of disease severity and timing of therapy most likely to result in benefit from this therapy. Given the activity of HBOT in modifying ischaemia-reperfusion injury, attention should be given to combinations of HBOT and thrombolysis in the early treatment of acute coronary events and the prevention of re-stenosis after stent placement. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:<BR/>
