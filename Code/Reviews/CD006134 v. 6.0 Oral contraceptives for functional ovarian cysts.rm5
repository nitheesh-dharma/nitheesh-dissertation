<TITLE>Oral contraceptives to treat cysts of the ovary</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-03 14:55:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women of reproductive age usually release an egg about once a month. The ovary gets an egg from the inside of the ovary to its surface by creating a blister or fluid-filled space around the developing egg. When the blister (or cyst) reaches the surface of the ovary, it bursts and releases the egg into the abdominal cavity. After this occurs, the blister can develop into another type of cyst, which makes a hormone (progesterone) that helps the pregnancy to grow. Most of these cysts come and go without problems. Sometimes, however, the cysts get large or painful; others may remain for months. Several decades ago, health care providers learned that women taking birth control pills had fewer cysts, since the pills usually kept an egg from being released. Based on this fact, many clinicians started treating these cysts with birth control pills to make them go away faster.</P>
<P>In March 2014, we did a computer search for all randomized controlled trials that studied use of birth control pills to treat these benign (also called functional) cysts. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We found eight trials from four countries; they included 686 women. Three trials included women receiving drugs to help them get pregnant. The other five included women who developed cysts without fertility treatment. In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-04-03 14:58:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts.</P>

<P>In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-21 22:07:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We identified eight randomized controlled trials from four countries; the studies included a total of 686 women. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives did not hasten resolution of functional ovarian cysts in any trial. This held true for cysts that occurred spontaneously as well as those that developed after ovulation induction. Most cysts resolved without treatment within a few cycles; persistent cysts tended to be pathological (e.g., endometrioma or para-ovarian cyst) and not physiological.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-11 18:40:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate. Should cysts persist, surgical management is often indicated.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-03 14:57:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Functional ovarian cysts (follicular and corpus luteum) are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. Hospital-based studies in the U.K. and USA have provided a range of reported incidences. In England and Wales from 1983 to 1985, the annual hospital discharge rate for women with a main diagnosis of ovarian cyst was 67 per 100,000 women (<LINK REF="REF-Westhoff-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westhoff 1992</LINK>). From 1984 to 1986 in the USA, the comparable figure was 131 per 100,000 women. In recent U.S. reports, more than a quarter million women per year have been discharged from hospitals with a diagnosis of ovarian cysts (ICD-9 codes 620.0 (follicular), 620.1 (corpus luteum), and 620.2 (other and unspecified) (<LINK REF="REF-Kozak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozak 2005</LINK>). In cross-sectional studies using ultrasound evaluation of women, 4% to 7% had ovarian cysts greater than 30 mm in diameter (<LINK REF="STD-Teichmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2002</LINK>). While many of these physiological cysts will resolve spontaneously, some require surgical intervention, with its attendant discomfort, risk, and expense (<LINK REF="REF-Chiaffarino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiaffarino 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-12-12 16:51:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Early epidemiological studies reported an inverse relationship between use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and surgically confirmed functional cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Ory-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ory 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramcharan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramcharan 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vessey-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vessey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Booth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth 1992</LINK>). Based on the apparent strong protective effect against functional cysts, some clinicians inferred that oral contraceptives might be useful for treatment as well as prevention. Since pituitary gonadotropins promote follicular growth and since combined oral contraceptives suppress gonadotropins, pills might decrease cyst size.</P>
<P>An uncontrolled case-series report popularized this approach. <LINK REF="REF-Spanos-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanos 1973</LINK> described 286 reproductive-age women with adnexal masses ranging from 4 to 10 cm in diameter; he treated each with a combined oral contraceptive. Most cysts regressed, and those that did not were found at operation to be neoplasms. Despite the lack of a comparison group in this report, many clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Starks-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starks 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muram-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muram 1990</LINK>) concluded that combined oral contraceptives hastened resolution of functional ovarian cysts, for example, claiming that "others have demonstrated that functional ovarian cysts regress more quickly when OCs are provided to women" (<LINK REF="REF-ContracTech-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">ContracTech 1982</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-12-05 20:36:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Despite the absence of an association between low-dose oral contraceptive use and the occurrence of functional ovarian cysts in more recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Holt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanes 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parazzini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parazzini 1996</LINK>), this treatment continues to be recommended: "...higher dose formulations should be considered for treatment purposes, although the overall risk/benefit ratio must be evaluated with caution" (<LINK REF="REF-Chiaffarino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiaffarino 1998</LINK>). Others, however, caution that "The results of two small trials do not support the prescription of oral contraceptives to treat pre-existing ovarian cysts" (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the frequency of ovarian cysts and the uncertainty concerning treatment with oral contraceptives, this review evaluated the randomized controlled trials addressing this question.</P>

Women allocated to oral contraceptives received a monophasic pill containing norethindrone 1 mg and mestranol 50 &#956;g daily for up to six weeks. Repeat ultrasound examinations took place at three, six, and nine weeks after beginning therapy. Those with a persistent cyst at nine weeks were referred for an operation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Ami-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Ami 1993</LINK> randomized 54 women with ovarian cysts after ovulation induction to either a combined oral contraceptive or to expectant management. The ovulation-induction techniques included clomiphene citrate and human chorionic gonadotropins or human menopausal gonadotropins and human chorionic gonadotropin. All women were confirmed by ultrasound examination to have ovarian cysts at least 2.0 cm in diameter. Women were randomized to a pill containing levonorgestrel 125 &#956;g plus ethinyl estradiol (EE) 50 &#956;g or to expectant management. Participants had a repeat ultrasound examination after one cycle. If the cyst had not resolved, oral contraceptive treatment continued for the OC group or was begun for the expectant-management group. However, this review includes only data from the first cycle comparing the two approaches.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Altinkaya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Altinkaya 2009</LINK>, 186 women were diagnosed as having a clomiphene citrate-related ovarian cyst greater than 20 mm. Cysts were diagnosed and later assessed with transvaginal ultrasonography. The women were randomized to 1) levonorgestrel (LNG) 100 &#956;g plus EE 20 &#956;g, 2) desogestrel (DSG) 150 &#956;g plus EE 30 &#956;g, or 3) placebo. Assessment occurred at four weeks. Those with persistent cysts were called for another visit 4 weeks later, treated again, and assessed at 12 weeks.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Turan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Turan 1994</LINK>, 80 women with simple cysts were randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms. The three oral contraceptives were as follows: 1) monophasic containing desogestrel 150 &#956;g plus EE 30 &#956;g; 2) monophasic containing levonorgestrel 250 &#956;g plus EE 50 &#956;g; and 3) multiphasic containing levonorgestrel 50/75/125 &#956;g plus EE 30/40/30 &#956;g. The fourth treatment group was expectant management. Women had to have unilateral, mobile, unilocular, thin-walled cysts without internal echoes; the size had to be from three to six cm in diameter. Women were randomized into four groups "by stratification according to cyst diameter and patient age." Repeat ultrasound examinations were done at 5 and 10 weeks after starting treatment. Because of the similarity of results in the three oral-contraceptive groups, in this review each oral contraceptive has been compared to the expectant management arm rather than with other oral contraceptives.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kilicdag-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kilicdag 2003</LINK> examined low-dose oral contraceptives, and randomized 62 women with ovarian cysts to three treatment arms. Like <LINK REF="STD-Turan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Turan 1994</LINK>, one of the active treatments was desogestrel 150 &#956;g plus EE 30 &#956;g. The other oral contraceptive was levonorgestrel 100 &#956;g plus EE 20 &#956;g, and the third arm received expectant management. Ultrasound assessments were conducted at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bayar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bayar 2005</LINK>, 141 women were randomly assigned to daily administration of an oral contraceptive containing desogestrel or to expectant management. The OC contained desogestrel 150 &#956;g plus ethinyl estradiol 20 &#956;g. The simple cysts were defined as unilocular, smooth-walled, and from 3 to 10 cm in diameter; they could be with or without internal echo. Laparoscopic intervention was conducted if the cyst persistent at six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Taskin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Taskin 1996</LINK> randomized 45 women, who had ovarian cysts of four to six cm in diameter, to either a combined oral contraceptive or to expectant management. Women allocated to pills received a preparation containing levonorgestrel 150 &#956;g plus EE 30 &#956;g in cyclical fashion for three cycles. Treatment began with the first cycle after ultrasound evaluation. All participants were followed with repeat ultrasound examinations "every four weeks and at the end of the second and third month just after menses." Outcomes included cyst resolution and cyst volume, measured by ultrasound.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sanersak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sanersak 2006</LINK>, 70 women with ovarian cysts were randomly assigned to a combined oral contraceptive or expectant management with 35 women in each arm. Women allocated to pills initially received "one package" of levonorgestrel 150 &#956;g plus EE 30 &#956;g. If no remission was noted by ultrasound at the one-month follow up, the woman continued on same treatment for another month and had another ultrasound assessment at two months.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Ami-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Ami 1993</LINK> found administration of oral contraceptives of no value in the setting of ovulation induction. Of 27 women (85%) given oral contraceptives, 23 (85%) had resolution of the cyst within one menstrual cycle, in contrast to 24 of 27 (89%) allocated to expectant management (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>: OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.14 to 3.57). No cysts persistent at the first observation period subsequently resolved with a second cycle of treatment. Of the seven women with persistent cysts, all had laparoscopy done. Two had dermoid cysts, two had para-ovarian cysts, two had hydrosalpinges, and one had a follicular (functional) cyst.</P>
<P>In another population having ovulation induction, <LINK REF="STD-Steinkampf-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Steinkampf 1990</LINK> found no benefit of oral contraceptives. The analysis was restricted to participants with cysts that resolved. At three weeks, 20 of 22 (91%) participants given oral contraceptives had resolution, in contrast to 16 of 19 (84%) assigned to expectant management. At six weeks, 21 of 22 (95%) and 18 of 19 (95%) had cyst resolution, respectively.

No benefit was found for oral contraceptives on cyst resolution compared to expectant management (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). With the two trials combined, 58 women were allocated to the oral contraceptive, of which 37 (64%) had resolution of the cyst by the last follow up (at two or three months). Among 54 assigned to expectant management, the corresponding figure was 33 (61%).

The mean volume in the group assigned to the oral contraceptive was 12.8 mL (standard deviation (SD) 9.2), while that in the expectant management group was 9.6 mL (SD 4.3). Eight women with cysts three to four cm in diameter that failed to regress underwent further treatment: three had percutaneous cyst aspiration under ultrasound guidance, and five had operations. Two of the five women having operations were found to have endometriomas, and the remainder had persistent corpus luteum cysts.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-17 19:28:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Treatment of functional ovarian cysts with oral contraceptives appears no better than watchful waiting. Most such cysts resolve spontaneously with or without treatment. The observation that cysts resolved after oral contraceptive administration (<LINK REF="REF-Spanos-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanos 1973</LINK>) led to the clinical impression that oral contraceptives had benefit (<LINK REF="REF-ContracTech-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">ContracTech 1982</LINK>), an example of <I>post hoc ergo propter hoc </I>reasoning (after the fact, therefore on account of the fact). In this common error in logic, a temporal association is inappropriately considered a causal association. Only with contemporaneous control groups could the putative effect of the contraceptives have been assessed. In none of these small trials was any important difference found. This held true for cysts discovered during ovulation induction and for those unrelated to fertility drugs.</P>
<P>Cystic masses that did not resolve within several months were unlikely to be functional cysts. Endometriomas, para-ovarian cysts, and other pathology accounted for most of these. In these circumstances, surgical evaluation of persistent or painful adnexal masses is appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1990</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-06-21 22:01:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Limitations of these studies include incomplete or no description of sequence generation and allocation concealment.

<P>Because of the small sample sizes and, in three reports (<LINK REF="STD-Turan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Turan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilicdag-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kilicdag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Altinkaya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Altinkaya 2009</LINK>) multiple treatment arms, the power of these trials to detect important differences was limited. For meta-analysis, we only aggregated trials that used the same oral contraceptives and had similar outcome measures. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, these trials do not suggest an important benefit of oral contraceptives in treating functional ovarian cysts.</P>
