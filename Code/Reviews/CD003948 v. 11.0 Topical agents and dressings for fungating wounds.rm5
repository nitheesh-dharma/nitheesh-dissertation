<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-17 14:05:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Fungating wounds sometimes occur in people with advanced cancer. Care usually aims to slow down disease progression, and improve quality of life by relieving the physical symptoms caused by the wounds (leakage, bad smell, pain and the risk of haemorrhage) by means of appropriate dressings and other applied treatments. There is weak evidence to suggest that a 6% solution of miltefosine, applied as a fluid to small, superficial fungating wounds on the breast (in people with breast cancer who had previously had either radiotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy or chemotherapy) may slow down the progression of the disease (i.e. extend the time to disease progression). There is also weak evidence to suggest that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing bad smell. There is very little evidence in this area of medicine, however, and what there is is insufficient to give clear directions to practice for improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms in people with fungating wounds. More research is needed in this area.</P>

<P>Four trials involving 164 people were included. One RCT in women with superficial breast lesions compared 6% miltefosine solution with placebo and found that miltefosine delayed tumour progression. The study reported that the time to treatment failure was significantly longer in the miltefosine group (median 56 days) than in the placebo group (median 21 days) (p value 0.007, log-rank test). A second trial compared topical metronidazole with placebo but the results up to the point of cross-over were not statistically significant. A third trial compared the effect of foam dressings containing silver to foam dressings without silver and found that more patients experienced decreased malodour in the foam with silver group than in the foam alone group (p value=0.049). The fourth trial compared the effect of manuka honey-coated dressings with nanocrystalline silver-coated dressings and found no statistically significant difference with regard to exudate, malodour and wound pain. All trials, however, had methodological limitations.<BR/>

<P>There is weak evidence from one small trial that 6% miltefosine solution applied topically to people with superficial fungating breast lesions (smaller than 1cm) who have received either previous radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy for their breast cancer, may slow disease progression. There is also weak evidence to suggest that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing malodour. There is insufficient evidence in this review to give a clear direction for practice with regard to improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms associated with fungating wounds.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-13 16:00:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fungating wounds arise from primary, secondary or recurrent malignant disease (cancer). These lesions may also be referred to as ulcerating tumours, malignant wounds or neoplasmic lesions. <LINK REF="REF-Grocott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 1995</LINK> defines a fungating wound as "the condition of ulceration and proliferation which arises when malignant tumour cells infiltrate and erode through the skin". <I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>The exact prevalence of fungating wounds is currently unknown, since these data are not collected by population-based cancer registries. However, current estimates for the prevalence of fungating wounds in cancer patients are between 5 to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Probst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Selby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selby 2009</LINK>). It should be noted that some people with fungating wounds will never seek support from health services due to embarrassment. Life expectancy in people with fungating wounds is limited and it is estimated that more than half will die within six months of diagnosis of a fungating ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>). Fungating wounds can occur in a diverse range of locations on the body but in women, the most common fungating ulcers are breast tumours which have metastasised to the breast. In men, the most common occurrence are cutaneous metastases from primary lung cancers but head and neck are also common sites in both genders (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fungating wounds can present as either raised nodules similar in appearance to a cauliflower (proliferative) or as a crater-like ulcer (destructive process) or a combination of both (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>). Fungating lesions are thought to interfere with tissue oxygenation, lymphatic drainage and haemostasis (maintenance of the healthy state of tissue). Reduced tissue perfusion, due to abnormalities in the vascularisation of solid tumours, leads to local cell anoxia (lack of oxygen), and sometimes cell death and tissue necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Hirst-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 1992</LINK>). Rapid tumour-cell growth may also affect the pH of extracellular fluid; this interferes with the clotting mechanism that leads to coagulation, and may cause occlusion of blood vessels and subsequent necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Grocott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 1995</LINK>). The lymphatic system may be impaired: interstitial fluid pressures (between parts of the tissue) can lead to vascular collapse causing infarction, hypoxia and necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bridel_x002d_Nixon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridel-Nixon 1997</LINK>). While anaerobic and aerobic bacteria thrive on necrotic tissue and produce malodour and profuse exudate, the fragility of tumour capillaries increases the risk of haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Grocott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the challenge of managing a fungating wound depends on the site of the wound, certain symptoms are common to most fungating wounds. Malodour is the most frequently reported physical symptom but other symptoms such as copious exudate, pain and itching, risk of haemorrhage and reduced quality of life are common (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009b</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 2008</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Probst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Selby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selby 2009</LINK>). The management of fungating malignant wounds is complex and challenging, and the physical, and psychological distress for patients and their carers is well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Bale-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bale 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fairburn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairburn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Lund_x002d_Nielson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund-Nielson 2005</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Probst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2013</LINK>). Although a very small proportion of patients may achieve healing after surgical excision or radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>), treatment is usually palliative and aims to achieve the best quality of life for patients and their families. Palliative treatment may include radiotherapy, and systemic or topical chemotherapy to reduce tumour size, exudate and malodour. These palliative treatments may be evaluated by the following means: measuring progressive growth of any treated skin lesion; development of any new lesions within an adequately-treated area; withdrawal of the patient because of poor tolerability of the study medication; non-compliance; refusal; or death of the patient. Topical wound management aims to alleviate physical symptoms such as copious exudate, malodour, pain, and the risk of haemorrhage. Its interventions may be evaluated by validated objective tools designed to measure a specific wound symptom or quality of life (for example the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haes 1996</LINK>)), withdrawal of the patient because of poor tolerability of the wound management product, non-compliance or refusal.</P>
<P>Dressings and topical agents may be selected to extend the time to disease progression (e.g. topical cytotoxic chemotherapy), or to cope with exudate (e.g. foams and alginate dressings) and malodour (e.g. metronidazole gel, charcoal-impregnated dressings, honey). Cutaneous pain management may be attempted with topical analgesia (e.g. topical diamorphine gel). The application of non-adherent dressings to minimise the trauma of dressing removal may reduce cutaneous pain, and also reduce the risk of haemorrhage through minimising tissue trauma during dressing changes. Although debridement is the usual approach for managing necrotic tissue in other wounds, the friable vessels within fungating wounds significantly increase the risk of haemorrhage, and therefore debridement is used with great caution. Bleeding or haemorrhaging fungating wounds may be treated with coagulant topical agents (e.g. haemostatic sponges) to achieve haemostasis.</P>
<P>Several literature reviews have been published which consider the clinical issues relevant to the management of fungating wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009a</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2013</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Grocott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selby 2009</LINK>) and these reviews identify the need for a systematic study of the problems encountered in the management of fungating wounds with wound dressings. The authors of this review have been unable to identify any previous systematic reviews of topical agents and dressings for the management of fungating wounds.</P>
<P>At present, good practice aims to extend the time to disease progression, or to achieve the best quality of life for patients by alleviating physical symptoms such as copious exudate, malodour, pain and the risk of haemorrhage. Symptom management is primarily through selection of an appropriate dressing and topical agent, although oral antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to reduce the bacterial count of necrotic tissue, and thus reduce malodour.<BR/>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or, in their absence, controlled clinical trials (CCTs) with a concurrent control group, that assessed the effects of a dressing or topical agent for the treatment of fungating wounds were eligible for inclusion in the review. Eligible trial reports could be published or unpublished, and written in any language. In RCTs with a cross-over design, data were considered only up to the point of crossover. This was because fungating wounds are not stable, and outcomes following cross-over are not easy to attribute to a particular treatment. In addition, there is a likelihood of carry-over with certain interventions. Studies were included if they provided results on primary or secondary outcomes specified in this review.</P>

<P>Studies evaluating topical agents and dressings, or dressing systems, applied to fungating wounds were included. Topical agents comprised all agents that may be applied topically, including drugs such as antimicrobial agents and topical cytotoxic agents. Dressings included all types of dressings that may be used as a primary contact layer (e.g. foams, alginates, hydrocolloids). Dressing systems consisted of combinations of topical agents, and primary and secondary dressings applied in a clearly-described, systematic manner.</P>

<P>For this review update two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance). We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study. We discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus. We present assessment of risk of bias using a risk of bias summary Fig.1, which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<P>Each outcome was assessed separately. Because of the small number of heterogenous studies identified pooling was not appropriate and a narrative overview is presented.</P>
<P>Should studies be included in future updates with available data, that data will be entered into and analysed using Cochrane RevMan software. Results will be presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Estimates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number of wounds healed -yes or no) will be reported as risk ratio (RR). Continuous data (e.g. total area healed, or changes in volume of wound area) will be converted to the standardised mean difference (or a weighted mean difference, when plausible) and overall effect size (with 95% CI) will be calculated. Time to wound healing and time to return to work will be analysed as survival (time to event) data, using the appropriate analytical method (as per the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook version 5). Methods of synthesising the studies will depend on their quality, design and heterogeneity. Both clinical and statistical heterogeneity will be explored. In the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity a fixed effect model will be applied to pool data.  In the presence of statistical heterogeneity, as estimated by the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic<SUP> </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), a random effects model will be applied for meta-analysis. </P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2001</LINK> study was a multi-centre, multi-national (British, Dutch and French), double-blind placebo-controlled trial that evaluated a topical form of cytotoxic chemotherapy, miltefosine solution, for containment or regression of fungating tumour (primary outcome), and effect on quality of life (secondary outcome) in 52 patients with superficial fungating breast lesions. The participants in this trial were women 18 years and older (with confirmed breast cancer and superficial or flat skin lesions (where the estimated depth of invasion below skin level was less than, or equal to 1cm). All participants had received at least one prior systemic endocrine or chemotherapy treatment. The two groups of patients were comparable in terms of patient characteristics, except for mean age (68 years in miltefosine group compared with 60 years in placebo group; P &lt; 0.05), and pre-treatment characteristics (trend for less prior treatment in miltefosine group).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bower-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bower 1992</LINK> study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated topical application of metronidazole gel for its effect on wound odour (primary outcome) in 11 people living at home with fungating wounds. The participants in this trial were predominantly female (10 female, one male), with a mean age of 68 years (range 51 to 85 years), open fungating primary or metastatic tumours (nine breast, one ovarian, one lung) producing an offensive odour graded at least 6/10 on a visual analogue scale (where 0 represents no odour) by both the patient and medical staff.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kalemikerakis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kalemikerakis 2012</LINK> study was a RCT, with 16 female participants (mean age female 73.94 +/- 8.58 years) and 10 male participants (mean age male 76.2 +/-5.85 years). 11 patients had fungating breast wounds, 7 patients had head and neck fungating wounds, and 8 patients had fungating wounds in other parts of the body. All the fungating wounds were malodorous. The trial compared foam dressings containing silver with a foam dressings without silver. Outcome of odour was measured as "No change", or "Reduction of odour", or "Increased odour".</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lund_x002d_Nielsen-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Lund-Nielsen 2011a</LINK> study refers to bandages, yet communication with the study author confirms that the term 'dressing' would be appropriate and this term is used throughout this review. This study was a RCT with 75 participants with advanced stage cancer and malignant wounds. Only 69 completed the intervention. Of these, 61 were female, 8 were male and their combined age ranged from 47.4 to 89.6 years. 55 patients had malignant breast wounds, 8 in the head and neck, and 6 in other parts of the body. The trial compared manuka honey-coated dressings with silver-coated dressings. Four outcomes were assessed; malodour measured by a verbal rating scale (<LINK REF="REF-Haughton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haughton 1995</LINK>) and by a visual analogue scale, wound pain measured by a visual analogue scale, change of wound size measured using digital photos and "Quantify Image" software (<LINK REF="REF-KLONK-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">KLONK 2014</LINK>), and exudate measured by dressing changes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Leonard 2001</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2001</LINK> trial report stated that the sample size calculation was informed by a meta-analysis of previous studies of 6% miltefosine, and determined by described statistical methods. This calculation allowed for a planned interim statistical analysis after the recruitment of 50% of the original sample, with a view to early discontinuation if a statistically significant difference between the two groups became evident. This occurred, and so recruitment ceased after the recruitment of 52 participants.</P>
<P>The methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were not described, but the trial was reported to be "a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial". Blinding of outcome assessment was reported. The groups were comparable at baseline except for age and pre-treatment. The miltefosine group had a mean age of 68 years, compared with 60 years in the placebo group, and this difference was statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.05). The miltefosine group also had a trend for less prior treatment. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the outcome of containment or regression of fungating tumours, and follow up for this outcome was complete.</P>
<P>With regard to assessment of quality of life (QoL), the study design contained a cross-over point at four weeks. Although QoL questionnaires were administered at week four, the study only reported QoL data at eight weeks. The authors were approached with a request to supply us with the QoL data from four weeks, but replied that these data are irretrievable. Therefore, there are no valid data available from this trial concerning QoL.</P>

Furthermore, the method of allocation concealment was not described, nor was the baseline comparability of the intervention groups. Although the trial was described as a double-blind trial, it was unclear whether blinded outcome assessment was used (i.e. assessment by an assessor who is unaware of the intervention group to which participants have been allocated). An intention-to-treat analysis was not undertaken. (Some patients who were randomised were not included in the analysis because they did not receive the study intervention, or they withdrew from the study or were not included because of protocol violation). Two withdrawals from the trial were reported along with the reasons for withdrawal. Follow up was complete, in that there were complete data for all participants at the defined study end-point.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-12-11 09:09:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results are reported with reference to the original outcome measures identified within the review.</P>
<P>The four included studies evaluate different topical preparations. <LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2001</LINK> evaluated the effect of topical cytotoxic chemotherapy, miltefosine solution, on quality of life (QoL), and containment or regression of fungating tumour. Miltefosine (Miltex; Asta Medica, Frankfurt, Germany) is a therapeutic cytostatic agent that has been demonstrated to have an effect in a range of tumours. It induces major gastrointestinal toxicity when administered systemically, but can be delivered topically when combined with glycerol ethers, which enable absorption through the skin. Delivery of the drug via this route significantly reduces the severity of side effects.</P>
<P>In this trial, 52 patients were randomised to receive either 6% miltefosine solution or placebo solution applied at the dose of two drops/10 cm<SUP>2 </SUP>of skin area including the affected skin and a margin of 3cm around each lesion, once daily during the first week and twice daily thereafter until treatment failure. Miltefosine solution (6%) is a clear, colourless and odourless, slightly viscous liquid, provided in 10 ml glass vials with a dropper that allows the delivery of the solution in drops of approximately 0.025 ml (38 to 40 drops/ml). The treatment was continued until progression occurred, unless the patient developed intolerable local skin reactions. If a complete response occurred, patients were asked to apply the treatment for at least a further four weeks. A complete response was defined as the complete disappearance of all lesions for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of any new lesions in the treated area. Patients with progression of the treated lesions within the first four weeks of treatment were withdrawn from the study and could be treated with the open label 6% miltefosine solution according to the investigator's decision. Patients with progression of the treated lesions after more than four weeks of treatment were not allowed to receive open-label miltefosine solution. Therefore, data from this trial were considered only for the first four weeks of treatment, i.e. to the point of cross-over.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bower-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bower 1992</LINK> evaluated the effect of topical application of metronidazole gel on wound odour. In this study, 11 patients with open fungating primary or metastatic tumours were randomised to receive either 0.8% metronidazole gel 1 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> lesion or placebo gel applied daily for six days. Doses varied between 3.75 g and 15 g per depending on the size of the lesion but were constant for each patient. None of the patients received anti-tumour therapy or antibiotics within the preceding four weeks, or for the duration of the trial. The initial trial was followed by an open assessment period of five days when all patients received metronidazole gel. Therefore, this trial was considered up to the point when the open assessment period commenced.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kalemikerakis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kalemikerakis 2012</LINK> evaluated the effect of foam dressings with silver versus foam dressings without silver in the care of malodorous malignant fungating wounds. The foam dressing with silver was an adhesive or a non-adhesive foam dressing containing 1mg/cm<SUP>2</SUP> of silver and measuring either 10cm x 10cm or 15cm x 15 cm depending on the ulcer size and peri-wound skin. The foam dressing without silver was an adhesive or a non-adhesive foam dressing measuring either 10cm x 10cm or 15cm x 15 cm depending on the ulcer size and peri-wound skin. The make of dressings used was not reported. 26 patients with malodorous malignant fungating wounds were randomised to receive either foam dressings with silver or foam dressings without silver. Wounds were cleansed using normal saline and a 10% povidone-iodine solution. Wound dressings were changed 2-3 times per week and patients were monitored for four weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lund_x002d_Nielsen-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Lund-Nielsen 2011a</LINK> evaluated the effect of honey-coated dressings compared with silver-coated dressings on treatment of malignant fungating wounds. 75 patients with advanced stage cancer and malignant fungating wounds were randomly allocated to one of two groups. The first group received manuka honey-coated dressings (Algivon/Activon Tulle UMF 12+, AdvaNordic Medical Group A/S, Soroe, Denmark) and absorbent dressing (Sorbion/Drymax, Mediq Danmark A/S, Broendby, Denmark) as well as foam dressings (Allevyn Adhesive, Smith &amp; Nephew A/S, Hoersholm, Denmark). The second group received nanocrystalline silver-coated dressings (Acticoat/Acticoat Absorbent, Smith &amp; NephewA/S) and foam dressings (Allevyn Adhesive, Smith&amp;NephewA/S). Wounds were cleansed using tap water and liquid medicinal soap (ph 4.5). Each home visit took on average 1.5 hours per patient and wounds were redressed every 2 to3 days over a 28 day intervention period.</P>

 evaluated the effect of miltefosine on containment or regression of fungating tumours. Skin lesions were assessed at baseline by written description, measured and photographed, and this procedure was repeated weekly for two weeks, fortnightly and then at four-week intervals.</P>
<P>The time from the start of the treatment to treatment failure was referred to as 'time to treatment failure'. Treatment failure was defined as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>progressive growth of any treated skin lesion according to the WHO definition (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1979</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>development of any new lesions within an adequately treated area;</LI>
<LI>withdrawal of the patient because of poor tolerability of the study medication;</LI>
<LI>withdrawal because of noncompliance, refusal or death of the patient.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The time from the start of treatment to progression (i.e. local progression within the treated area) was referred to as time to progression.</P>
<P>The WHO criteria were used to provide objective evaluation of the response of individual lesions and the overall response of each patient (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1979</LINK>). The complete disappearance of all lesions for at least four weeks without the appearance of any new lesions in the treated area was defined as a complete response. A partial response was defined as a decrease by at least 50% of the sum of the products of two perpendicular diameters of lesions without the appearance of any new lesions within the treated area, or the increase of any treated lesion by more than 25% of the sum of the products of two perpendicular diameters. A decrease in size of less than 50%, or an increase of less than 25%, was defined as no change. An increase in size of 25% of any measurable lesions within the treated area (with reference to the smallest size of the lesion recorded during the study period in case of transient regression) was defined as progressive disease. A remission had to be confirmed by a second measurement after four weeks.</P>
<P>The study found that the time to treatment failure was significantly longer in the miltefosine group (median 56 days, range 8 to 324 days) than in the placebo group (median 21 days, range 8 to 197 days) (P value 0.007, log-rank test). Since no data were reported at four weeks for the outcomes of time to progression and the objective response rate, these could not be included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lund_x002d_Nielsen-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Lund-Nielsen 2011a</LINK> measured change in wound size. The median decrease in wound size in Group A (honey-coated dressings) was 15 cm<SUP>2</SUP> compared with 8 cm<SUP>2</SUP> in Group B (silver-coated dressings). This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.563). There was no significant reduction in wound size for all patients (p = 0.388) in spite of the fact that 62% of the patients experienced some decrease in wound size. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-12-11 10:48:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review highlight the lack of research in this area. There is relatively little evidence to direct practice for improving quality of life through the use of dressings and topical agents for people with fungating malignant wounds. While the results of one included trial suggest that topical miltefosine solution slows disease progression (<LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2001</LINK>), the poor reporting of the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment, allied with the lack of comparability between the intervention groups at baseline for mean age and pre-treatment characteristics, mean that we cannot be confident that this is a valid result. In addition, this trial evaluated only small and superficial fungating wounds of the breast in patients in reasonable general health, which limits the generalisability of the findings.</P>
<P>Evidence that might guide clinical practice in managing the symptoms associated with fungating wounds was restricted to three studies. One small study suggested that metronidazole gel might be useful in reducing malodour (<LINK REF="STD-Bower-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bower 1992</LINK>). A second study suggested that foam dressings containing silver may also be effective in reducing malodour (<LINK REF="STD-Kalemikerakis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kalemikerakis 2012</LINK>). The third study found no evidence of difference between honey-coated dressings and silver-coated dressings. Issues such as the poor reporting of exclusion criteria, randomisation methods, allocation concealment, baseline comparability, blinded outcome assessment, the lack of an intention-to-treat analysis and use of small sample sizes means there is uncertainty about the validity of these results. A replication of these studies using larger sample sizes, improved methodology and better reporting to investigate the effects of these interventions for improving quality of life, and reducing malodour and exudate levels, might be useful. No evidence was found concerning management of any other symptoms of fungating wounds.</P>
<P>Overall, we found that the evidence base for guiding selection of dressing(s) and topical agent(s) for management of fungating wounds is negligible. We did not identify any previous systematic review of this subject, but found several literature reviews that included similar patient outcomes (malodour, cutaneous pain, tumour progression and exudate management) (<LINK REF="REF-Grocott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2013</LINK>) as well as several qualitative research studies into the experience of having a malignant fungating wound (<LINK REF="REF-Lo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 2008</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Lund_x002d_Nielson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund-Nielson 2005</LINK>
; <LINK REF="REF-Probst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2013</LINK>). This research confirms the relevance of the outcomes of this review to patients with fungating malignant wounds and it is encouraging to see the emergence of more research in this field. However, there has been little advance in terms of robust research evidence to answer questions of clinical effectiveness in the management of fungating wounds.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The outcomes to be measured in RCTs need careful consideration. Traditionally, trials in wound care have focused on wound healing, which is an inappropriate outcome for patients with fungating wounds. Since treatment for fungating wounds is mainly palliative, the primary aim of future research should be to improve quality of life. In clinical terms, there is a close link between clinically effective alleviation of distressing symptoms and a patient's quality of life. In research terms, however, quality of life has a very specific meaning and is measured by specific tools. Evaluating quality of life as a primary outcome, or designing a study to be sufficiently powered to evaluate it adequately as a secondary outcome, is of particular significance for this patient group.</P>
<P>Other outcomes that are highly relevant for patients with fungating wounds are the palliation of distressing symptoms, such as copious exudate, malodour and pain and these are outcomes that can be measured objectively using an achievable sample size, and thus should be evaluated within an RCT.The outcomes of research into care for patients with fungating wounds need to be more specific and achievable, with a focus on obtaining objective measurements of symptom control in the clinical situation. Subjective approaches to measurement, such as seeking the opinion of the patient or clinician, or based on in vitro, laboratory-based studies, rather than measuring how products function on real people are fundamentally flawed. Systematic, objective approaches that enable the use of a common language to evaluate symptom management, dressing use, dressing performance and patient experiences are being developed (<LINK REF="STD-Grocott-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Grocott 2001a</LINK>), and should be more widely utilised.</P>
<P>The emergence of two new RCTs which can be included in this review is encouraging but it must be acknowledged that it is difficult to carry out RCTs for fungating wounds. RCTs may be possible for some outcomes, but there may be other outcomes relevant to management of fungating wounds which are very difficult to measure. For these outcomes, less robust study designs, such as multiple case study designs (<LINK REF="REF-Grocott-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grocott 2001b</LINK>), may be the highest level of evidence available. There may also be difficulties in conducting RCTs particularly because of the ethical challenges of recruiting patients who are approaching the end-stage of their lives. Although all ethical trials should be well designed and reported, it is particularly important that the design of trials for this group of patients should be sufficiently elegant to be capable of providing relevant and reliable information, while minimising the burden on the patients recruited into them. For example, RCTs that measure pain or malodour are unlikely to need long follow-up periods or large sample sizes, since any clinically-meaningful changes are likely to have a large effect size, and be achieved relatively swiftly. We would argue that to deprive this group of patients of robust clinical information derived from high quality RCTs is ethically questionable, since this information is needed to direct the selection of clinically-effective interventions that will benefit patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-11 10:49:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is weak evidence to suggest that patients with superficial fungating breast lesions (smaller than 1cm in depth) who have received either previous radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy for their breast cancer may extend the time to disease progression by receiving topical 6% miltefosine solution (<LINK REF="STD-Leonard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 2001</LINK>). There is also weak evidence to suggest that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing malodour (<LINK REF="STD-Kalemikerakis-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kalemikerakis 2012</LINK>). There is insufficient evidence in this review to give a clear direction for practice with regard to improving quality of life or managing other wound symptoms associated with fungating wounds.</P>

<P>The four studies summarised in this review were small and had methodological problems; they would benefit from being replicated in larger, well-designed studies. The four studies addressed only some of the outcomes relevant to patients with fungating wounds. Since treatment for fungating wounds is mainly palliative, the primary aim of future research should be to concentrate on improving quality of life through improvements in symptom management.</P>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and Ovid CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> respectively. The Ovid MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebrve-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebrve 2011</LINK>). The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>). No date or language restrictions were applied.</P>
