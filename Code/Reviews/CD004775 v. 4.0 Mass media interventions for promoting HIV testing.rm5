<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Mass media campaigns designed to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS have shown immediate and significant effects in the promotion of voluntary counseling and testing for HIV.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>According to UNAIDS, 42 million people in the world have HIV infection. Notably, the majority of new infections are preventable and are spread through unsafe sex. Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) can lead to the practice of safe sexual behaviors and increased condom use, thus preventing spread of the disease.</P>
<P>While mass media campaigns have shown an immediate and significant overall effect on VCT, no significant long-term effect was demonstrated. This may have been due to the short duration of the campaigns. Further research is needed to identify the impact of mass media campaigns, their cost effectiveness, and types of campaigns and message characteristics. In addition, more studies are needed to explore new media strategies for the long term.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Use of the mass media is one of the important strategies in communicating behavioral change in relation to HIV/AIDS prevention. Mass media are used to promote voluntary HIV counseling and testing and to sustain test-seeking behavior.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of mass media interventions and the most effective form of mass media intervention at a general population level or in specific target populations, in relation to changes in HIV testing, compared with a control group or with pre-intervention levels.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1980 to April 2004), NLM Gateway, CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), AIDSearch (1980 to April 2004), and PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004), Sociological abstracts (1982 to April 2004), and Communication studies (1982 to April 2003). The reference lists of related reviews were searched and experts in the field were contacted to identify ongoing research. Relevant web sites of international agencies (UNAIDS, WHO, UNFPA, World Bank, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were also searched. All these searches were done without language restriction. All databases were searched up to April 2004.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized trials and controlled clinical trials, that compared either multimedia interventions or one type of media strategy with a control in relation to promotion of HIV testing were included. Interrupted time series analyses that assessed the effect of mass media against no media or an alternative intervention to promote HIV testing were also included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Types of mass media interventions, participants, and outcomes were extracted in every possible instance.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of the 35 references that were identified, two randomized controlled trials, three non-randomized controlled studies, and nine interrupted time series were included in the final analysis. All individual studies concluded that mass media were effective, and this was confirmed by reanalysis of the interrupted time series studies which all had initial impact. Mass media interventions for promotion of HIV testing showed significant immediate (Random effect: Estimated mean = 5.487, 95%CI = 2.370 to 8.605) and overall (Random effect: Estimated mean = 6.095, 95%CI = 1.812 to 10.378) effect. No long-term effects were seen on mass media interventions for promotion of HIV testing (Random effect: Estimated mean = 4.447, 95%CI = -0.188 to 9.082).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Mass media interventions have immediate and overall effects in promotion of HIV testing. No long-term effects were seen. There was no significant impact of detecting seropositive status after mass media intervention for promoting HIV testing, and this finding was limited to a small number of studies. Further research is required to identify possible effects on seropositivity status after mass media intervention for promotion of HIV testing among high-risk groups in epidemic countries. Additional research is needed to identify the effectiveness of different types of mass media interventions, the cost effectiveness of the interventions, and characteristics of messages.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>According to UNAIDS, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic claimed more than three million lives in 2003 with an estimated five million people acquiring the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This brings the number of people living with the virus to 42 million, as the world enters the third decade of the AIDS epidemic. Globally, the majority of infections are transmitted through unsafe sex (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-_x002f_WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS /WHO 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>HIV testing is the process by which blood or body fluids are analyzed for the presence of antibodies or antigens produced in response to HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) is the process by which an individual undergoes counseling, enabling him or her to make an informed choice about being tested for HIV. This decision must be entirely the choice of the individual, and he or she must be assured that the process will be confidential (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2000</LINK>). It is usually combined with pre- and post-test counseling. The pre-test counseling prepares the client by explaining and discussing the HIV test process, myths and misinformation about HIV/AIDS, implications of testing, risk assessment, risk prevention, and coping strategies. The main aim of post-test counseling is help to clients understand their test results and initial adaptation to their seropositive or seronegative status with referral as required. VCT is one of the key tools in HIV/AIDS prevention, and it includes benefits at both the individual and community levels. Currently, a systematic review is being done to determine the effectiveness of voluntary counseling and HIV testing for prevention of HIV infection in resource-constrained settings (<LINK REF="REF-Sweat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweat 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>People who obtain information about their health status are better able than those who do not to make decisions regarding their own health care. Knowledge of serological status through testing and counseling allows the infected person to access HIV-specific care, treatment, and appropriate referrals for individual needs and support. Such support includes a wide range of services, including medical care, ongoing emotional support, and social support. The benefits of antiretroviral therapies include delaying the progression from HIV infection to AIDS, and can improve HIV-related morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Huotari--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huotari 2001</LINK>). Voluntary counseling and testing can lead to the practice of safe sexual behaviors (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flaskerud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaskerud 1997</LINK>). Systematic review on impact of VCT on risk behavior in developing countries also showed increased condom use after VCT (<LINK REF="REF-Julie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julie 2004</LINK>). VCT can be used cost- effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Sweat-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweat 2000</LINK>). It is also useful in targeting persons at high risk because risky behaviors are positively associated with the decision to take the HIV test (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>). Knowledge of seropositive status also allows HIV infected people to practice safe sex behaviors and to prevent further transmission of the HIV virus (<LINK REF="REF-Deren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1999</LINK>). It allows people to make informed decisions on issues including sexual practices, nutrition, family planning, prevention of mother-to-child (vertical) transmission, and relationships with partners and families. It strengthens prevention efforts through risk-reduction strategies for HIV infected people. VCT helps communities reduce the denial and discrimination that often surround HIV/AIDS and mobilize support for appropriate responses (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). It provides evidence-based approaches to specific recommendations for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2001</LINK>) and is one of the monitoring and evaluating indicators of a second-generation HIV surveillance system (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-_x002f_WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS /WHO 2002</LINK>). This provides policy makers with essential information on estimates of the prevalence of HIV infection and on changing risk patterns in the community. A common barrier to VCT is the lack of perceived benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Baggaley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baggaley 1995</LINK>). Other common barriers include lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, stigma, discrimination, gender inequalities, and cultural barriers. HIV/AIDS is highly stigmatized in many countries and people with HIV may experience social rejection and discrimination (<LINK REF="REF-Karim-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karim 1995</LINK>). Mass media are useful in attempting to overcome these barriers. Mass media can play an important role in voluntary informed HIV testing (<LINK REF="STD-Wolitski-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolitski 1996</LINK>). Social marketing of VCT is one of several identified strategies for scaling up VCT services (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNAIDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNAIDS 2001</LINK>). These include innovative methods of communication and community mobilization campaigns. </P>
<P>When media such as television, radio, the Internet, newspapers, books, posters, and billboards are used to communicate to thousands of people at the same time, they are known as mass media (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1993</LINK>). Sometimes a large number of people can communicate in more than one medium under same theme; that is called multimedia. Mass media have become pervasive in our daily lives and are used to inform, entertain, or persuade. The mass media can tie communities together by providing messages to the entire population so they may share similar interests and ideas. Each individual medium has its strengths and weaknesses. Mass media are powerful and often credible providers of information and entertainment; some are useful for modeling and skill training in some areas (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1993</LINK>). Some media are affordable and accessible in both developed and developing countries. Even illiterate people can use media like radio and television. Both radio and television are more popular among adults and young people. Mass media can reach almost all levels of target groups and can cover a large segment of the population. It comprises one important strategy in communicating behavioral change messages relative to HIV prevention. Changing behavior is a complex process that involves several factors and steps. Mass media can be used to educate and raise awareness about a topic and can enhance appropriate utilization of health care services (<LINK REF="REF-Grilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 1992</LINK>). Various types of mass media can be used to communicate HIV/AIDS preventive massages. Mass media can also play an important role in publicizing the benefits of VCT. According to the health belief model, mass media are useful for clients perceiving their state of health or risk of disease; determining the probability of taking appropriate health plans of action; and determining the perceived benefits of preventive action and the perceived barriers to preventive action (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1994</LINK>). They are also helpful in creating an enabling environment. Bandura's social learning theory ("cognition theory") states that most behaviors are learned though modeling, and that vicarious learning from others is a powerful teacher of attitudes and behavior (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2001</LINK>). That is, individuals learn not only in classrooms, but also by observing role models in everyday life, including characters in movies and television programs. A systematic review on mass media interventions for health services utilization has found some evidence to support an impact of mass media on behavior change. Some of the findings from studies on the mass media's impact on rates of HIV blood testing seem to suggest a non-specific impact of the message conveyed by the campaigns, resulting in an increase in the overall volume of tests performed across all risk groups (<LINK REF="REF-Grilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 2002</LINK>). Grilli's review covered a large number of high-risk groups with non-stigmatized diseases as well as high-risk groups for HIV/AIDS. All high risk groups for HIV/AIDS have less health care seeking behaviors than other persons due to stigma. It is necessary to find out the initial, overall, and long-term effects of the mass media's impact because implementation of future activities of behavior change communication in relation to the promotion of voluntary HIV testing. It is important to conduct a systematic review to determine the overall and long-term effects of mass media's impact on the promotion of voluntary HIV testing, and to determine the most effective form of media. </P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We used the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group search strategy.</P>
<P>The following electronic bibliographic databases were searched with help of three expert librarians: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1980 to April 2004), NLM Gateway, CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), AIDSearch (1980 to April 2004), PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004), Sociological abstract (1982 to April 2004), and Communication studies (a SAGE full text collection 1982 to April 2003).<BR/> <BR/>Both NLM Gateway and AIDSearch covered the abstracts from the international conferences. AIDSearch covered MEDLINE HIV/AIDS subset, AIDS drugs, and AIDS trials. All these searches were done without language or time restriction. All databases were searched until the end of April 2004. The reference lists of related reviews and all articles obtained were also reviewed for additional citations. Experts in the field were contacted to identify ongoing research. Other relevant web sites of international agencies, especially those concerned with the prevention of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, WHO, UNFPA, World Bank, and Center for Disease Control and Prevention) were also searched.</P>
<P>The following search terms were used to locate the relevant studies:<BR/>1. 'HIV test' or 'HIV testing';<BR/>2. Voluntary counseling;<BR/>3. #1 or #2;<BR/>4. 'mass media';<BR/>5. communication*;<BR/>6. 'multi media;<BR/>7. multimedia*;<BR/>8. 'mass communication';<BR/>9. 'audiovisual equipment';<BR/>10. 'patient information';<BR/>11.

<P>Slight modifications of this strategy used for some databases. No language restrictions were imposed.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Titles and abstracts identified from the searches were checked by two reviewers independently (JV and MJA). The full text of all studies of possible relevance were obtained for independent assessment by two reviewers. The reviewers decided which trials fit the inclusion criteria and recorded the methodological quality (depending on the study design). Data on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes, and quality of the study were extracted from the reports for specifically designed data collection forms. HIV seropositive status, sexual orientation of subjects, type of media, duration of the intervention, and cost effectiveness for each program were also recorded when relevant data was reported. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers (JV, MJA) and by referral to the third reviewer (AF or CF). Where there was uncertainty about the data, authors were contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>For ITS, when information on the value of individual observation over time was only reported graphically in the original paper, data were derived by scanning the figures into a computer and electronically measuring each data point. This approach has been previously used in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Grilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 2002</LINK> ). Out of all nine ITS studies, data from eight studies were taken from graphs. Most time series studies did not perform any statistical analysis. RevMan software does not yet support calculation of effect sizes in interrupted time series studies, so studies were analyzed in Stata (version 8.2). Other eligible studies were summarized in RevMan 4.2.7 (Update Software, Oxford). One reviewer entered all data (AF), and it was rechecked by another reviewer (JV). All analyses were done by one reviewer (AF). </P>
<P>Data from original papers were extracted and reanalyzed according to recommended methods for analysis of ITS designs for inclusion in systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK>). These methods utilize a segmented time series regression analysis to estimate the effect of an intervention while taking into account secular time trends and any autocorrelation between individual observations. For each study, a first order autoregressive time series model was fit to the data using a modification of the parameterization of <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK>. Details of the mode specification are as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<I>Y= ß<SUB>0</SUB>+ ß<SUB>1</SUB>time+ ß<SUB>2</SUB> (time-p) I(time &gt; p) +ß<SUB>3</SUB> I(time &gt; p)+ E, E~ N(0, s<SUP>2</SUP>)</I>
</P>
<P> For time =1,...,T, where p is the time of the intervention, I(time <U>&gt;</U> =p) is a function which takes the value 1 is time is p or later and zero otherwise, and where the errors <I>E </I>are assumed to follow a first order autoregressive process (AR1). The parameters ß have the following interpretation.</P>
<P>ß<SUB>1</SUB> is the pre-intervention slope.<BR/>ß<SUB>2 </SUB> is the difference between post and pre-intervention slopes.<BR/>ß<SUB>3 </SUB>is the change in level at the beginning of the intervention period, meaning that it is the difference between the observed level at the first intervention time point and that predicted by the pre-intervention time trend.</P>
<P>In addition, the following quantities are also of direct interest. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·The difference in level at the end of the intervention period compared to that predicted by the pre-intervention slope. This is represented by <I>(t-p)ß<SUB>2</SUB> +ß<SUB>3</SUB>
<B> </B>
</I>from the above equation.</LI>
<LI> ·The average monthly difference in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) over the post-intervention period compared to that predicted by the pre-intervention trend. The AUC can be interpreted as the total number of screenings over the post-intervention period. The overall difference in AUC between that observed and predicted can be computed to equal one-half of the sum of the differences between observed and predicted counts at the start of intervention and at the end of the post-intervention period, multiplied by the duration of the post-intervention period. Dividing this quantity by the duration of the post-intervention period produces an average monthly AUC difference between observed and predicted counts, represented by <I>(t-p)ß<SUB>2 </SUB>+2ß<SUB>3</SUB> /2 .<B> </B>
</I> This re-scaling to the average monthly difference was performed to enable comparison across studies of varying intervention lengths. This AUC can be interpreted as the average number of additional screenings per month post-intervention compared to that predicted by the pre-intervention trend.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The ß parameters in the above regression model were estimated using the Prais-Winstein first order autocorrelation version of generalized least squares (GLS) regression (<LINK REF="REF-Prais-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prais 1954</LINK>), as implemented in the Stata software package (version 8.2). This method differs slightly from the Cochran-Orcutt regression proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK>, in that it uses a different estimate of the autocorrelation parameter, but arguably is preferable for short time series -- it retains the first observation in the time series. Standard errors of change in slope and change in level at the beginning of the intervention period were obtained directly from the regression output. Standard errors of each the difference in level at the end of intervention and average AUC difference were obtained by manipulation of appropriate terms of the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates from the regression. </P>
<P>After obtaining the above parameter estimates, a qualitative overall interpretation of the joint effects of the change in slope post-intervention, difference in level at the beginning of intervention, and difference in level at the end of intervention period was achieved by constructing a three-way table (additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and placing each study's result in the appropriate cell in the table. Note that <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK> proposed a two-dimensional table, and we simply have added the third dimension to enable a summary of three, rather than two, quantities. Descriptive labels were assigned to the various cells in the table according to immediacy of effect, and decay or increases over time. </P>
<P>Formal meta-analyses were performed for the three quantities labeled above, plus the average monthly AUC difference. Data were re-scaled to units of months where necessary and standardized by the pre-intervention standard deviation as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK>. DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis models were then used for each of the above four quantities to pool results over the individual studies. </P>
<P>Pooling Intervention impacts of all studies were measured in the following way (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001b</LINK>). </P>
<UL>
<LI> ·Change in trend over time.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was assessed by the difference between the pre- and post-intervention slopes.</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·Initial impact of the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was assessed by the difference between the level predicted by the pre- phase, extrapolated to the first point in the post- phase, with that of the predicted level of the post-intervention regression at the first point in the post-phase. In essence, it compares the magnitude of the first point in the post-phase with an estimate as to what it would have been had there been no intervention.</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·Long-term impact of the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was assessed by the difference between the level predicted by the pre- phase, extrapolated to the last point in the post- phase, with that of the predicted level of the post-intervention regression at the last point in the post-phase. Similar to above, this compares the last point in the post-phase with what it may have been had there been no intervention.</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·Overall impact of the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The area under the curve, between the level predicted by the pre- phase, extrapolated to the entire post- phase, was compared with the predicted level of the post-intervention regression after scaling to monthly differences as described earlier.</P>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> index (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) was used to quantify the percentage of the total variation in results across studies that are due to true heterogeneity rather than chance. I<SUP>2</SUP> produces values ranging from 0 to 100%. Its value is comparable across meta-analyses with different numbers of studies and with different types of outcome data. </P>
<P>Randomized trials and non-randomized trials were analyzed separately.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>See table 'Characteristics of included studies' for complete description of trials. </P>
<P>From the 35 references that were identified, two randomized controlled trials, three non-randomized controlled trials and nine ITS were included in the final analysis. Seven studies were done in United Kingdom, three in the United States of America, two in Australia, and one each in Canada and Israel. No studies were found from developing countries or countries with generalized HIV epidemics. These studies targeted the general public (n=8), pregnant mothers (n=2), gay community (n=1), blood transfusion recipients (n=1), and women (n=2). Although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Harcourt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harcourt 1988</LINK>) targeted the general public, HIV testing uptake was only assessed among commercial sex workers.</P>
<P>Several different categories of interventions were identified. Most studies used multimedia (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dwyer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dwyer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harcourt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harcourt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McOwan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McOwan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tesoriero-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tesoriero 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>) and one each used video (<LINK REF="STD-Apanovitch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Apanovitch 2003</LINK>), television (<LINK REF="STD-Maayan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maayan 1989</LINK>), and group education, ie participatory education and didactic education with skills training (<LINK REF="STD-Amaro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amaro 2001</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1999</LINK>) used leaflets and discussion with participants. Multimedia included television, radio, newspapers, leaflets, and posters. The theoretical models used to develop media messages were only mentioned in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Amaro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amaro 2001</LINK>). Both duration and frequency of intervention were different between studies. Most of the studies did not mention the frequency of intervention. Only one study compared the effectiveness of the different categories of media but this was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1993</LINK>). All studies measured the uptake of HIV testing, but time duration varied from study to study. Out of 14 studies 12 reported interviewer-assessed outcomes and the remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Amaro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amaro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Apanovitch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Apanovitch 2003</LINK>) used self-reported HIV testing. </P>
<P>Nine ITS analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dwyer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dwyer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harcourt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harcourt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maayan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maayan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tesoriero-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tesoriero 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>) were pooled. All of these studies had multimedia interventions except one study (<LINK REF="STD-Maayan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maayan 1989</LINK>), which included AIDS educational programs on television. No facilitator-based participatory programs were included. All interventions were based on watching, reading, or hearing information, which was not influenced by the facilitator for clarifications or questions. These included television, radio, newspapers, and posters. All nine interrupted time series studies had interview-assessed outcome data and targeted the general public except one study (<LINK REF="STD-Poulin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 1997</LINK>) which targeted blood transfusion recipients. These common factors also supported pooling. </P>
<P>Out of nine ITS analyses, seropositive status was recorded in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>). Sexual orientation of the population was recorded in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>) but a comparison was not done due to insufficient data. Comparison between different types of mass media could not be done due to insufficient data. None of the studies reported cost effectiveness of the interventions.</P>
<P>There were insufficient numbers of studies to compare mass media interventions for promotion of HIV testing between HIV/AIDS epidemic and non-epidemic countries. No studies were reported from developing countries.</P>
<P>The reasons for excluding 16 studies are given in Characteristics of excluded studies.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Key features of the studies included are summarized in the table of Characteristics of included studies. <BR/>The following criteria were used to assess the methodological quality of studies depending on the study design.</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·For RCTs and CCTs:</LI>
</UL>
<P>The quality assessment included an evaluation of the following components for each included study, since there was some evidence that these might be associated with biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>).<BR/>a) Similarity of both the intervention and control groups and that groups were treated equally except for the intervention.<BR/>b) The method of generation of the randomization sequence.<BR/>c) The method of allocation concealment.<BR/>d) Who was blinded / not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors).<BR/>e) Losses to follow up and whether the participants were analyzed in the groups to which they were originally randomized (intention-to-treat).</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·For Interrupted Time Series (ITS):</LI>
</UL>
<P>ITS studies were considered using the seven criteria determined by the EPOC group to enable reliable statistical inference (http://www.epoc.uottawa.ca/methods.htm).<BR/>a) Intervention occurred at clearly defined point in time and there were at least three data points before and after the intervention.<BR/>b) Intervention was independent of other changes, and a formal test trend was reported.<BR/>c) Intervention was unlikely to have affected the data collection.<BR/>d) There was assessment of primary outcomes, or there were objective outcome variables. <BR/>e) Completeness of the data set, which covered 80% or more of the total number of participants in the study.</P>
<P>Quality of two RCTs was satisfactory. Both studies had performed statistical analysis. There was similarity of both the intervention and control groups, and treatment of both groups (except for the intervention) was adequate in both RCT studies. Data collection was identical before and after the intervention, and losses to follow up were minimal in both RCTs. </P>
<P>Only two of the three before and after studies performed statistical analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Amaro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amaro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McOwan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McOwan 2002</LINK>). Although neither of these studies were randomized, both had overall good methodological quality. Similarity of both the intervention and control groups, and treatment of both groups (except for the intervention) were adequate in these studies. The study carried out by <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1999</LINK> was not analyzed and only percentage increase was given. The control group data has been taken from an RCT which was done in previous year (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P> Although quality of individual time series studies in this review was variable, overall it was adequate. All studies had a clearly defined point in time for the intervention, and all had at least three data points before and after the intervention. The mean number of pre-intervention data points was 12, and the mean number of post-intervention data points was 14. All studies had interviewer outcome assessment. Most of these studies did not perform any statistical analysis (n=8), and one applied a different regression technique. Statistical heterogenicity was avoided by reanalyzing indivudual ITS.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>All the included studies originally concluded that mass media were effective in promoting uptake of HIV testing. </P>
<P>Individual results of two randomized controlled studies and three nonrandomized controlled studies also showed a positive impact on HIV testing after mass media interventions. Statistical pooling of RCT and CCT data was not attempted because of methodological and statistical heterogeneity between the trials. Thus, the conclusions are based on a narrative synthesis of the RCT and CCT studies. However, all RCTs and two CCTs had good quality. </P>
<P>One randomized study (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1998</LINK>) compared two types of leaflets, which were offered by four different methods compared with controls who did not receive any intervention (n=3024). There were no differences between all four methods of intervention, and each of these methods had significant effect on uptake of HIV testing compared to the control group (X2= 308.5, df=4 P&lt;0.001). During analysis all four methods were pooled and compared with the control group, which gave a significant impact on uptake of HIV testing (RR=6.29, CI = 4.84 - 8.19, analysis figure1). </P>
<P>The second randomized study (<LINK REF="STD-Apanovitch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Apanovitch 2003</LINK>) compared gain-framed and loss-framed video tapes among low-income ethnic minority women without a control group. Gain-framed messages focus on the attainment of a desirable outcome or the avoidance of an undesirable outcome, both of which are beneficial. Loss-framed messages can emphasize the attainment of an undesirable outcome or the failure to attain a desirable outcome. Thirty-eight percent of participants who saw the gain-framed video reported being HIV tested compared with 26% who saw a loss-framed video. There was a significant persistent advantage among women who viewed the gain-framed video on HIV testing [X2=4.84,P&lt;0.05] after six months time.</P>
<P>Statistical pooling of data from the three CCTs was also limited because of statistical and methodological heterogeneity. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-McOwan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McOwan 2002</LINK>) showed positive uptake of HIV testing with multimedia campaigns targeted to gay and bisexual men in London compared with control group which did not receive any intervention (rate ratio= 4.55). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Amaro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Amaro 2001</LINK>) compared two types of educational programs (participatory education and didactic education with skills training) that contained the same content on HIV prevention with controls who did not receive any education. There were no differences in uptake of HIV testing between the two intervention groups. Only didactic education with skills training was significantly more likely than control to increase HIV testing 12 weeks after the intervention (OR=2.50; 95% CI = 1.02 - 6.12), but this significant effect was lost at three-month follow-up. This study also revealed a negative long-term impact of mass media interventions. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1999</LINK>) showed increased uptake of HIV testing following the distribution of leaflets targeted to pregnant women compared with a control group who did not receive any intervention (RR=15.96, CI = 12.33 - 20.66, analysis figure 2). </P>
<P>Results of the individual ITS analysis are summarized in the additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, and individual study results scaled by pre-intervention standard deviation are given in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Individual study results were scaled by standard deviation to standardize the population size of each study. </P>
<P>Based on additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, the following combinations of outcomes were obtained from individual analysis. </P>
<P>1. Positive change in level both at the beginning and end of the intervention with positive slope.<BR/> ·Three studies were identified in this category after reanalysis (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>). These indicated the most positive lasting outcome following the intervention. There was an initial impact with increased effect over time.</P>
<P>2. Positive change in level both at the beginning and end of the intervention with negative slope.<BR/> ·Two studies were identified in this category after reanalysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dwyer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dwyer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tesoriero-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tesoriero 1992</LINK>). These indicated initial benefits post-intervention but with decaying effect over time. </P>
<P>3. Positive change in level at the beginning of the intervention and negative at the end with negative slope.<BR/> ·Four studies were identified after reanalysis (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harcourt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harcourt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maayan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maayan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 1997</LINK>). These indicated only initial benefits of the intervention but with large decay over time, to the point that the final post-intervention value was less than what would be predicted if there had not been any intervention. </P>
<P>Our reanalysis confirmed that all nine interrupted time series found mass media had a significant initial impact on uptake of HIV testing. Three studies had both short and long term impacts, two studies had initial benefits with some decay, and four studies had only an initial impact.</P>
<P>The following results were obtained after pooling nine interrupted time series using random effects models.</P>
<P>1. Change in slope: Estimated mean was - 0.140 (95%CI -0.640 to -0.361, P = 0.585) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%.</P>
<P>2. Change in level at the beginning of the intervention: Estimated mean was 5.487 (95%CI = 2.370 to 8.605, P=0.001) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity (I2) = 80%.<BR/>This shows significant initial impact of mass media for uptake of HIV testing. I<SUP>2</SUP> indicates severe heterogeneity.</P>
<P>3. Change in level at the end of the intervention: Estimated mean was 4.447 (95%CI = -0.188 to 9.082, P = 0.060) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity I2 =66%.<BR/>This shows a moderate but imprecise long-term impact of mass media for uptake of HIV testing. The I<SUP>2</SUP> indicates moderate heterogeneity.</P>
<P>4. Difference in average monthly under the curve: Estimated mean difference was 6.095 (95%CI = 1.812 to 10.378, P= 0.005) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity I2 =77%.</P>
<P>This shows significant overall impact of mass media for uptake of HIV testing. I<SUP>2 </SUP>indicates severe heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In summary, the pooled results of the nine interrupted time series showed immediate and overall effects of mass media interventions for promotion of HIV testing.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses in relation to HIV seropositivity were done in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>). Results of the HIV seropositivity status of individual ITS analysis are summarized in the additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Individual study results scaled by pre-intervention standard deviation are given in additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1987</LINK>) showed positive change in levels both at the beginning and end of the intervention with positive slope in relation to seropositivity. This indicated a very good outcome with both an initial impact and further improvement over time in detecting HIV seropositivity. Positive changes in level both at the beginning and end of the intervention with negative slope on seropositive status were seen in the study done by <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1987</LINK>. This indicated initial benefits with decay over time. A negative change in level at the beginning of the intervention and positive at the end with a positive slope in relation to seropositivity were seen in the study done by <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK>. This showed an initial deficit with a delayed effect for detecting HIV seropositivity.</P>
<P>The following results were obtained after pooling the three interrupted time series in relation to the HIV seropositivity using random effects models.</P>
<P>1. Change in slope: Estimated mean was 0.044 (95%CI= -0.381 to 0.468, P = 0.840) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity indicated none.</P>
<P>2. Change in level at the beginning of the intervention: Estimated mean was 1.80 (95%CI = -0.399 to 3.99, P=0.109) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity equals 42%. This showed mass media had no significant initial impact for finding seropositivity and moderate heterogeneity.</P>
<P>3. Change in level at the end of the intervention: Estimated mean was 3.395 (95%CI = -2.031 to 8.820, P= 0.22) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity indicated none. Thus, mass media interventions had no significant long-term impact on seropositivity after HIV testing. </P>
<P>4. Difference in average monthly area under the curve: Estimated mean was 2.942 (95%CI = -0.599 to 6.484, P= 0.103) (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). Index of heterogeneity indicated none. There was no significant overall impact of mass media on seropositivity after HIV testing.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review included nine interrupted time series, two randomized controlled trials and three nonrandomized controlled studies. </P>
<P>Although statistical pooling of RCT and CCT were limited because of methodological and statistical heterogeneity between the trials, a narrative synthesis of each individual study confirmed the effectiveness of mass media for promoting VCT. The strong methodological quality of the controlled trials strengthens the case for the effectiveness of mass media.</P>
<P>The analysis was robust with respect to a wide range of methodological procedures. With a limited number of randomized trials in the health promotion field, ITS are useful for making decisions. However, just like controlled trials, ITS should have a good methodological quality to enable reliable statistical inference. </P>
<P>Traditionally, time series analysis has typically been applied to much longer series than those available here. Estimation of autocorrelation parameters are particularly problematic with small series lengths. The Prais-Winstein method applied here to the time series from individual studies has appeal due to its simplicity; however, the quality of estimates of regression parameters produced and their standard errors have not been rigorously assessed, and certainly not in the context of meta analysis of such series. This needs to be further investigated. In addition, for pragmatic reasons we have assumed, as did <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay--2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001a</LINK>, a linear trend pre- and post-intervention for each study, whereas there may be substantial non-linearity in reality. In addition, there may be a time lag between implementation and its effects in the community, and there may be seasonal effects -- with short series these are difficult to control. </P>
<P>The seriousness of violations of linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity also need to be rigorously assessed in the context of both individual studies and meta analysis. Estimates in the short individual time series also are susceptible to influence by aberrant data points; however, the pooling across studies is likely to diminish this in the pooled result. Nonetheless, despite these potential shortcomings, it is likely that assuming a simple AR(1) regression model as done here is substantially better than applying standard (independence) linear regression models and pretending that autocorrelation did not exist. <BR/>ITS studies, which were included in this review, had a mean number of 12 pre-intervention data points and 14 post-intervention data points.</P>
<P>All nine interrupted time series were reanalyzed to reduce statistical heterogeneity between trials. These results indicated that all studies found a positive initial impact upon taking HIV testing after mass media interventions.</P>
<P>Due to the short nature of the time series in the studies we assessed, individual, grossly aberrant data points have the potential to heavily influence individual analyses. Inspection of the raw data for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK> revealed that the first of six pre-intervention values was far lower than the rest, causing the pre-intervention slope to be positive and large. Removing this observation substantially altered all parameter estimates for that study; however, the overall results when pooling across studies only differed marginally due to the relatively low weight given to the <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1990</LINK> study. </P>
<P>Statistical heterogenicity was avoided by reanalyzing individual ITS. Four separately pooled effects were calculated to estimate effectiveness of mass media on uptake of HIV testing in interrupted time series studies. Based on the results, we can offer the following summary of our findings.</P>
<P>There was a significant initial and overall impact of mass media on the uptake of HIV testing, but non-significant impact for long-term results. These results were mainly based on multiple media interventions for the general public. Only one study was based on televised interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Maayan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maayan 1989</LINK>) and one study targeted blood transfusion recipients (<LINK REF="STD-Poulin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 1997</LINK>). No facilitated mass media programs were included in the pooled estimates. Each pooled study included either radio or television interventions. Although this review was limited to developed countries, television and radio can be used in both literate and non-literate communities. Therefore, the findings are likely to be applicable to developing countries as well. </P>
<P>Heterogeneity between trials was seen. There was too little evidence to compare multimedia and single media strategies in this review. Both time duration and intensity differed with each study. Quality of media campaigns in each study was difficult to assess. The vitality of adequate design and development prior to the launch of any media campaign is described in "Social Marketing Approach". This approach tries to apply the principles of advertising and marketing to the 'selling' of positive health behaviors (<LINK REF="REF-Wallack-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallack 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>A comprehensive search strategy used in the review was likely to have located most of the published and unpublished studies; therefore, the risk of publication bias was small. Funnel plots which may be useful to detect absence of small negative studies (Additional <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>) were not particularly informative here, as is often the case with reviews of a small number of studies. The only general feature in these plots appears to be an absence of small studies with both large and small effects. <BR/> <BR/>Subgroup analysis showed no significant increase of detecting seropositive status after mass media interventions to promote HIV testing. In other words, while we found that mass media interventions can stimulate VCT uptake in general, we found no evidence that mass media stimulates additional diagnosis of HIV through VCT. However, two individual studies found an initial impact on seropositive status and one found delayed effects. But this finding was limited to three studies done in UK among the general public. All three studies used multimedia interventions and none were targeted to high-risk groups. Homogeneity was seen among these three studies, but a small number of studies that were limited to one non-epidemic country cannot give a strong conclusion on seropositivity. Although three studies showed no significant impact on detecting seropositive status after mass media interventions to promote HIV testing, these results may be different among high-risk groups in epidemic countries. Further research is needed to determine seropositive status among high-risk groups and epidemic countries after mass media intervention programs for promotion of HIV testing. </P>
<P>We were unable to compare the type of mass media interventions, sexual orientation of persons, characteristics of messages, or to assess cost effectiveness due to a lack of relevant studies. Future research is required to address these questions. The cost effectives of mass media interventions for promoting HIV testing need to be considered in relation to the workload of laboratories and counseling services.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was sufficient evidence to support using mass media for promotion of VCT. This review shows mass media can influence the uptake of VCT. They have a significant immediate and overall effect; however, mass media showed no significant long-term impact on uptake of HIV testing. This may be due to the duration of the intervention being too short. </P>
<P>Although statistical pooling of RCTs and CCTs was difficult due to heterogeneity, all individual study results showed positive impacts of mass media on uptake of HIV testing. These findings further supported the use of mass media in promoting HIV testing. Overall one would expect a positive impact of communicating behavior change on the prevention of HIV/AIDS. No significant effect was detected in general in relation to increasing the number of infected persons diagnosed through VCT after mass media intervention promoting HIV testing. However, this finding was limited to a small number of studies conducted in one non-epidemic country.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is required to identify the impact of mass media intervention for promotion of HIV testing on seropositivity status in high-risk groups and epidemic countries. Additional research would identify the cost effectiveness, type of mass media interventions, and characteristics of messages in mass media to promote HIV testing. This is essential in both epidemic and non-epidemic countries for targeted high-risk groups and the general public. Further, more studies are required of new media strategies to maintain impacts in the long term.</P>
