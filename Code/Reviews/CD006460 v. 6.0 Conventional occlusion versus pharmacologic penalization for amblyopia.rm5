<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 14:25:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Amblyopia (referred to as lazy eye) is a common childhood condition, and is defined as defective visual acuity in one or both eyes, which is present with no demonstrable abnormality of the visual pathway and is not immediately resolved by wearing glasses. Treatment for amblyopia usually starts with prescribing necessary glasses to correct visually important refractive errors followed by promoting the use of the amblyopic eye. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of two different treatment options used to promote the use of the amblyopic eye: conventional occlusion (patching) and atropine penalization (drops). Conventional occlusion involves patching the non-amblyopic eye with an opaque patch for a set number of hours per day. Atropine penalization involves the instillation of atropine sulphate to blur the eyesight of the better-seeing eye.</P>
<P>We included three randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with a total of 525 amblyopic eyes. Evidence from three trials (one of good methodological quality) suggests both conventional occlusion and atropine penalization produce visual acuity improvement in the short-term (six months) and long-term (24 months) in the amblyopic eye after initiation of therapy. The results of this review show atropine penalization to be as effective as conventional occlusion, although the amount of improvement achieved differed among the three trials. Although both treatments were well tolerated, compliance was better with atropine penalization. Atropine penalization can be used as first line treatment for amblyopia.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 14:17:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Three trials with a total of 525 amblyopic eyes were included. One trial was assessed as having a low risk of bias among these three trials, and one was assessed as having a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Evidence from three trials suggests atropine penalization is as effective as conventional occlusion. One trial found similar improvement in vision at six and 24 months. At six months, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved from baseline 3.16 lines in the occlusion and 2.84 lines in the atropine group (mean difference 0.034 logMAR; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.005 to 0.064 logMAR). At 24 months, additional improvement was seen in both groups; but there continued to be no meaningful difference (mean difference 0.01 logMAR; 95% CI &#8722;0.02 to 0.04 logMAR). The second trial reported atropine to be more effective than occlusion. At six months, visual acuity improved 1.8 lines in the patching group and 3.4 lines in the atropine penalization group, and was in favor of atropine (mean difference -0.16 logMAR; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.09 logMAR). Different occlusion modalities were used in these two trials. The third trial had inherent methodological flaws and limited inference could be drawn.</P>
<P>No difference in ocular alignment, stereo acuity and sound eye visual acuity between occlusion and atropine penalization was found. Although both treatments were well tolerated, compliance was better in atropine. Atropine penalization costs less than conventional occlusion. The results indicate that atropine penalization is as effective as conventional occlusion.</P>

<P>Both conventional occlusion and atropine penalization produce visual acuity improvement in the amblyopic eye.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 14:42:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Amblyopia (referred to as lazy eye) is a common childhood condition, and is defined as defective visual acuity in one or both eyes, which is present with no demonstrable abnormality of the visual pathway and is not immediately resolved by wearing glasses. The term is used most frequently to refer to the unilateral condition, although it may be unilateral or bilateral. In adults, it is usually diagnosed by a significant reduction in visual acuity, which cannot be improved by refractive correction, and which has no obvious organic cause (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ciuffreda-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuffreda 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 2006</LINK>). Factors commonly associated with amblyopia and sometimes used for classification include strabismus (squint), stimulus deprivation such as cataract or ptosis, and those caused by anisometropia or unequal refractive error (need for glasses) between the two eyes.</P>
<P>Amblyopia develops during early childhood (infancy to 12 years or older) when the visual system is vulnerable to changes in visual stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Ansons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansons 2001</LINK>). During this time it is usually a reversible condition. If left untreated it will remain as a permanent visual defect into adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Rahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tommila-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tommila 1981</LINK>). About 25% of patients with amblyopia will have a visual acuity in the amblyopic eye worse than 20/100 (<LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 1994</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia potentially places a substantial burden on patient and health care resources as the visual impairment can last a lifetime. The estimated prevalence of amblyopia is between 2% to 3%, depending on diagnostic criteria used and the population selected (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Attebo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attebo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flom-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flom 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2002</LINK>). Two recent Australian adult population-based cohort studies, Visual Impairment Project and Blue Mountains Eye Study, reported the prevalence of unilateral amblyopia to be 3.1% and 3.2%, respectively, when amblyopia was defined as visual acuity of 6/9 or worse (<LINK REF="REF-Attebo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attebo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>). Lower amblyopia prevalence was reported in preschool screening programs (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors associated with the development of amblyopia include premature birth, low birth weight, retinopathy of prematurity, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, family history of amblyopia, congenital cataract, maternal factors such as smoking, antihistamine ingestion and alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AOA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOA 1997</LINK>). However, many children who present with amblyopia have none of these risk factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia of certain etiologies may not produce symptoms that are obvious to a parent or the affected child.</P>
<P>Unilateral refractive amblyopia may go unnoticed for years because the child typically has good visual acuity in the normal eye. As a result, many children remain undiagnosed, especially before they begin school. The refractive error is detected at the first appointment but a diagnosis of amblyopia cannot be made until the child has been reassessed with the refractive correction in place. Bilateral refractive amblyopia can be easier to detect as the child may struggle with close work or complain of reduced or blurred vision.</P>
<P>In strabismic amblyopia, strabismus is present and the eyes are not aligned properly resulting in one eye being used less than the other. The majority of children with strabismic amblyopia can be detected by the appearance of the strabismus (squint) (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>). However, the degree of strabismus may range from a very small deviation, for example, microtropia (five degrees or less) with useful binocular vision, to a very large deviation, which may affect a person's appearance.</P>
<P>Deprivation amblyopia caused by cataracts may be detected at discharge from hospital of new borns or at eight-week postnatal examination. Cosmetically unacceptable ptosis (droopy lid) will present at an early age for treatment.</P>
<P>The basis of a diagnosis of amblyopia is defective central visual processing, therefore, careful assessment of the retina, optic nerve and all other structures within the eye is essential. Attention should also be paid to the potential risk factors for amblyopia, such as a positive family history for strabismus, amblyopia, or media opacity (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>). The diagnosis is established by a unilateral or bilateral reduction of best-corrected visual acuity not attributable to structural abnormalities of the visual pathways.</P>
<P>Criteria for a diagnosis of unilateral amblyopia (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2007</LINK>) include:<BR/>1. Unequal fixation behavior.<BR/>2. 2-octave difference in preferential looking, or &#8805; 2 line interocular difference in best corrected visual acuity.</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-05 16:23:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of all treatment options for amblyopia is to obtain the best possible visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. The initial treatment for any patient with amblyopia is full-time wear of necessary refractive correction. The period of refractive adaptation (time taken to settle into glasses) is thought to be up to 24 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>). The effectiveness of refractive correction as an initial treatment for amblyopia has been summarized in a recent Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Shotton-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shotton 2008b</LINK>). The initial treatment is usually followed by promoting the use of the amblyopic eye through limiting the use of the sound eye, such as conventional occlusion or atropine penalization. Three published Cochrane systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Antonio_x002d_Santos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonio-Santos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shotton-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shotton 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shotton-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shotton 2008b</LINK>) examine various interventions for patients with different types of amblyopia. None have assessed specifically the comparison between occlusion therapy and atropine penalization. Therefore, the treatment options to be discussed within this review are occlusion therapy and atropine penalization.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Occlusion treatment</HEADING>
<P>Occlusion treatment for amblyopia was first described in 1772 (<LINK REF="REF-Fells-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fells 1990</LINK>). Patching the non-amblyopic eye with an opaque patch forces the patient to use the amblyopic eye. Opinions vary on the number of hours of patching per day that should be prescribed, ranging from one hour to full-time (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>), and the concurrent activities whilst patching is being carried out (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Atropine penalization</HEADING>
<P>Atropine penalization has been an alternative to occlusion therapy for amblyopia for over a century. Atropine sulphate, a long acting topical cycloplegic agent, is instillated into the sound eye (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swann-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swann 1974</LINK>) to blur the vision in the sound eye for near activities, hence forcing the amblyopic eye to be used preferentially for near vision tasks. Atropine penalization can be used alone or in combination with optical penalization. Opinions vary on the number of days that atropine penalization should be prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Factors affecting outcome</HEADING>
<P>Compliance plays a large role in determining the effectiveness of occlusion therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Newsham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newsham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 2005</LINK>). Prescribed doses of treatment may be less than the actual dose taken by patients. Less treatment may be better tolerated and as effective as more traditionally used dosage (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>). In addition, the initial visual acuity, type of amblyopia, treatment initiation age, and the efficacy of treatment modality may also play a role.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 15:53:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Occlusion therapy with patching of the sound eye has been the mainstay of amblyopia treatment. The success of occlusion depends heavily on compliance. Success rates vary from 30% to 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Kaye-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaye 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Repka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repka 1993</LINK>). There are also conceptual concerns about the degree to which unilateral occlusion disrupts binocularity, as well as the number of hours of patching per day that should be prescribed.</P>
<P>The practical benefit of atropine penalization is its ease of administration, reliable assessment of compliance, and its low cost. It is thought to be more acceptable than occlusion to both children and their parents, because it avoids both the skin irritation and social stigma of a patch (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1997</LINK>). The reported compliance rates vary from 78% to 100% for atropine penalization (<LINK REF="REF-Kaye-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaye 2002</LINK>). The disadvantage of atropine penalization is its potential toxicity and its duration of effect if reverse amblyopia is detected.</P>
<P>Reverse amblyopia, in which the initially better eye is made amblyopic as a result of the treatment, seems particularly likely to arise when patients fail to continue follow-up visits to the treating physician (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1997</LINK>). This can occur with both treatment options.</P>
<P>A systematic review is needed to examine the evidence with regard to effectiveness and safety of occlusion therapy compared to atropine penalization in treating amblyopia.</P>

<P>The electronic searches retrieved 106 records (26 from CENTRAL, 41 from MEDLINE and 39 from EMBASE). After removing the duplicates, 56 titles and abstracts underwent initial screening for eligibility, and 17 appeared to be relevant. One abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Yan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2008</LINK>) is awaiting classification as the corresponding full text article is not available. Of the 16 articles that underwent review of the full text, four reports were excluded: three were not reports of RCTs or CCTs, and one did not address the comparisons of interest.</P>
<P>The remaining 12 articles reporting findings from two trials were relevant to this review (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>We included three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK>) from three countries (Ireland, United States and Spain) with a total of 525 amblyopic eyes in the review. The trials varied in size with the smallest enrolling 36 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>) to the largest enrolling 419 participants (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>). Included participants were boys and girls aged from two to 10 years with all levels and types of amblyopia (strabismus, anisometropia, or both).</P>
<P>We found clinical heterogeneity in several aspects, including the age of participants, baseline visual acuity and type of amblyopia. Different distribution of these factors across trials were of concern because older age at commencement of treatment, worse starting visual acuity, and strabismus as the cause of amblyopia have been related to poorer response to amblyopia treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiscox-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiscox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Specifically, <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> enrolled 36 Irish children younger than nine years of age with all levels and types of amblyopia. No participant had received previous treatment prior to their inclusion. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> enrolled 70 Spainish children between two to 10 years of age. No participant had received previous treatment of amblyopia prior to inclusion. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye was at least 0.5 logMAR (mean = 0.43 logMAR). The inclusion criteria only allowed for moderate to mild amblyopia. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> enrolled 419 U.S. children younger than seven years of age with all types of amblyopia. Baseline vision in the amblyopic eye ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 logMAR (20/40 to 20/100 Snellen equivalent). Children in whom any ocular pathology was present or who had received more than two months of amblyopia therapy in the past two years were excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> included amblyopic eyes of worse baseline visual acuity and a larger proportion of children with strabismic amblyopia compared with the other two trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The included trials evaluated a variety of interventions and prescribing regimens. Different regimens of occlusion, including partial occlusion and total occlusion, and atropine penalization were studied. Specifically, <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> prescribed full-time total occlusion for one week per year of life. Once vision improved to 6/9 or better, occlusion was reduced to half days. The average duration of full-time total occlusion was 4.3 months (range two to nine months) but compliance was documented to be only 55%. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> prescribed a minimum of six hours daily occlusion with some participants (20%) prescribed 12 hours daily over the initial six month period. After six months, atropine or patching was followed by best clinical care for two years. The variable nature of the occlusion regimens for the participants makes it difficult to report exactly how much occlusion was worn by the participants. Excellent compliance was documented in 49% of cases. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> used partial occlusion by means of positive defocus of the sound eye. The treatment period was six months.</P>
<P>The comparison intervention of these three trials, atropine penalization, was prescribed more consistently than that of occlusion regimen. <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> prescribed one drop per day of atropine sulphate 1%; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> prescribed 1% atropine twice weekly when interocular acuity difference was present, and once weekly for maintenance therapy. A recent trial (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2004</LINK>) has shown that weekend atropine provides a similar improvement in vision to daily atropine for participants aged between three to seven years with moderate amblyopia (0.3 to 0.6 logMAR, 20/40 to 20/80 Snellen equivalent).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All trials examined visual acuity in the amblyopic eye and the sound eye. However, the vision test used varied: <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> used the validated Amblyopia Treatment Study visual acuity testing protocol; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> used the logMAR Crowded Glasgow acuity cards; and <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> used the Snellen chart, Kay's Pictures, or Sheridan-Gardener test types, depending on the age and comprehension of the patient. Different measurement instruments may introduce information bias and heterogeneity in determining visual acuity outcomes. Certain vision tests are known to be comparable, crowded Kay's Pictures and Crowded LogMAR, although crowded Kay's Pictures is an easier test to perform (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>The timescale at which visual acuity was recorded during the trial also varied considerably. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> assessed visual acuity at baseline, six and 24 months follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> at baseline, the conclusion of therapy (treatment was considered to have been concluded when a visual acuity of 6/6 was achieved, or when visual acuity remained static over three successive assessments), and after the longest term follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> scheduled follow-up appointments every two to six months, depending on the severity of amblyopia and the response to treatment; however, for statistical analysis data were recorded at three and six month follow-up examinations.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>The randomization sequence was inadequately generated in <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>. Participants were assigned to treatment groups on an alternate basis.

<P>Adequate allocation concealment prevents selection bias. We considered investigators enrolling participants possibly could foresee assignment in <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>, and thus may have introduced selection bias. Randomization in <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> was accomplished on the study's web site, which was one form of central allocation with adequate concealment. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> did not report explicitly in the article how allocation was concealed. Through written personal communication, the lead investigator informed us that a central office steering committee handled the randomization process so that investigators who determined eligibility and enrolled individuals were unaware of the assignment order.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Masking (blinding) of primary outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome for this review was visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. All three trials masked personnel examined visual acuity. Specifically, <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> reported that the vision tester was masked to treatment group for 97% of the examinations at six months, and 92% at 24 months. The reported success of masking in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> was 90.6% (29/32) of the optical and 87% (27/31) of the pharmacologic penalization groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> excluded seven (10%) participants from the analyses. Excluding randomized participants from analyses was of particular concern because those excluded may have a different distribution of baseline characteristics and different responses to treatment from those retained, and therefore may introduce bias. Post-treatment visual acuity was reported for all 36 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>. However, there was limited information on the duration of follow-up, in particular the time point at which the post-treatment visual acuity was assessed. If visual acuity were measure at different follow-up times, information bias would have been introduced. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> had 96% and 95% follow-up rate at six-months and two-years respectively. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Missing values were handled using last follow-up carry forward method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>We had insufficient information to assess the risk of selective reporting bias in <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>The statistical analyses for two trials were inadequate (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK>). The analyses compared pre and post-treatment visual acuity in each treatment group. However, no between group comparison was made and therefore no meaningful inference could be drawn. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> provided standard deviations for the visual acuity improvement in each arm. We used this information to calculate the between group effect estimate. However, this estimate should be interpreted cautiously since missing values have not been accounted for. Lastly, the sample size was very small to detect any meaningful clinical difference in <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>We did not assess the potential for publication bias using a funnel plot because only three trials were included.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment has alerted us to one study with methodological concern (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK>). The study characteristics, including study methods, population and intervention varied across all three trials. As a result of substantial clinical heterogeneity, we decided not to pool the quantitative data in a meta-analysis. Instead, we reported the results separately for each trial wherever data were available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes </HEADING>
<P>Of the three trials included in the review, data were available for the comparison between conventional occlusion versus atropine penalization with or without optical penalization.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>
<BR/>In this trial, 419 participants were randomized to receive either conventional occlusion (215 participants) or atropine sulphate penalization (204 participants). The primary outcome of the trial was visual acuity in the amblyopic eye after six months of treatment.</P>
<P>At six months, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved substantially from baseline in both the patching and atropine group (3.16 lines and 2.84 lines respectively). Improvement was initially faster in the patching group, but at six months, the difference in visual acuity between the two treatment groups was small and clinically inconsequential (mean difference (MD) 0.034 logMAR; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.005 to 0.064 logMAR) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The six-month visual acuity was 0.2 logMAR (6/9 or 20/30 Snellen equivalent) or better in the amblyopic eye in 63.5% (132/208) of the patching group and 53.1% (103/194) of the atropine group (risk ratio (RR) 1.20; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Among participants who had both baseline and six-month visual acuity measurement, 87.0% (181/208) of the patching group and 82.5% (160/194) of the atropine group gained 2 or more lines of vision in the amblyopic eye from baseline (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); 13.0% (27/208) of the patching group and 17.5% (34/194) of the atropine group had visual acuity within 2 lines of baseline (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); no participant experienced a loss of 2 or more lines of vision in either the patching or atropine group.</P>
<P>Most patients were prescribed amblyopia therapy beyond six months until the two-year outcome: 91% in the patching group and 85% in the atropine group. The actual treatment regimens prescribed were associated with the initial treatment assignment at randomization. Patching was prescribed for 84% of children treated with patching during the initial six months, and atropine was prescribed for 78% of children treated with atropine during the initial six months.</P>
<P>At 24 months, additional visual acuity improvement in the amblyopic eye was seen in both treatment groups. Visual acuity improved from baseline to a mean of 3.7 lines in the patching group and 3.6 lines in the atropine group. There continued to be no meaningful difference between groups in mean visual acuity score (MD 0.01 logMAR; 95% CI &#8722;0.02 to 0.04 logMAR) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The 24-month acuity was 0.2 logMAR (6/9 or 20/30 Snellen equivalent) or better in the amblyopic eye in 75.0% (141/188) of the patching group and 70.9% (124/175) of the atropine group (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Among participants who had both baseline and 24-month visual acuity measurement, 90.4% (170/188) of the patching group and 86.9% (152/175) of the atropine group gained 2 or more lines of vision in the amblyopic eye from baseline (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); 9.6% (18/188) of the patching group and 12.6% (22/175) of the atropine group had visual acuity within 2 lines of baseline (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); one participant in the atropine group experienced a loss of 2 or more lines of vision in the amblyopic eye.</P>

<BR/>Seventy participants were randomized to receive either optical penalization achieved by positive defocus of the sound eye (35 participants) or atropine 1% prescribed twice weekly (35 participants). The primary outcome of the trial was visual acuity of the amblyopic eye. The duration of treatment was six months and outcomes were assessed at the conclusion of treatment.</P>
<P>At six months, improvement in visual acuity from baseline occurred in both the optical penalization and atropine group. The trial authors did not report the effect estimates (e.g. mean difference, risk ratio) between groups. We calculated the effect estimates and CIs based on available information. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved by 1.8 lines in the optical penalization group and 3.4 lines in the atropine penalization group (MD -0.16 logMAR; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.09 logMAR) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Improvement in vision was greater in the atropine group than the optical penalization group. Visual acuity was 0.2 LogMAR or better (6/9 or 20/30 Snellen equivalent) in the amblyopic eye in 56.3% (18/32) of the optical penalization group and 74.2% (23/31) of the atropine group (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). At six months, 56.3% (18/32) of children treated with optical penalization and 87.1% (27/31) of those treated with atropine gained 2 or more lines of vision in the amblyopic eye from baseline (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); 43.8% (14/32) of the patching group and 12.9% (4/31) of the atropine group had visual acuity within 2 lines of baseline (RR 3.39; 95% CI 1.25 to 9.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); no participant experienced a loss of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye.</P>

<BR/>Thirty-six participants were randomized to receive either full-time occlusion for one week per year of life (18 participants) or 1% atropine sulphate drops instilled daily (18 participants). The primary outcome for the trial was change in acuity of the amblyopic eye at the end of treatment. The treatment interval ranged from two to nine months (mean 4.3 months) for the occlusion group and one to 12 months (mean 7.2 months) for the atropine group.</P>
<P>The trial reported that visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved from baseline to a mean of 0.66 logMAR units in the patching group and 0.5 logMAR in the atropine group. The analyses compared pre and post-treatment visual acuity in each treatment group. No between group comparison was made. Visual acuity was 0.2 LogMAR or better (6/9 or 20/30 Snellen equivalent) in the amblyopic eye in 44.4% (8/18) of the occlusion group and 61.1% (11/18) of the atropine group (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37). Although individual patient outcome data were available, we felt unjustified to calculate the mean difference and the 95% CI for two reasons. First, three different vision charts were used to measure visual acuity (see '<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>'). Second, we were concerned that the visual acuity was measured at different time points for each child. We could draw limited inference from this trial regarding the relative effectiveness of patching versus atropine on visual acuity.<BR/>

<P>As part of the PEDIG trial, the Amblyopia Treatment Index questionnaire was developed to assess the psychosocial impact on the child and family of patching and atropine. The Amblyopia Treatment Index questionnaire asked questions on one of three underlying factors: adverse effects of treatment, difficulties with compliance and social stigma of the treatment. The internal-consistency reliability for the overall scale was 0.89. The results indicated that both atropine and patching treatments were well tolerated by the child and family, although atropine received more favorable scores overall and on all three questionnaire sub-scales. The scores of the patching group were better than might have been anticipated based on the investigators' clinical experience. Patient adherence to the occlusion protocol was documented as excellent in 49% of cases compared to 78% of cases in the atropine group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> assessed compliance to atropine penalization by dynamic retinoscopy, and in the optical penalization group "peeking over top of glasses" was documented by examiners during assessments.

<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> found that at six months a beneficial effect of both patching and atropine was present in all subgroups based on patient characteristics.

The relative treatment effect did not vary with age (P = 0.84), cause of amblyopia (P = 0.68), or baseline amblyopic eye acuity (P = 0.59). Patients with acuity of 20/80 to 20/100 appeared to improve faster when a greater number of hours of patching was prescribed, but by six months, the amount of improvement was not associated with the number of hours of patching initially prescribed.</P>

<P>Visual acuity in the non-amblyopic eye was the primary safety outcome of concern. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> reported that at six months, visual acuity in the sound eye was decreased from baseline by 1 line in 14 participants in the patching group and 30 participants in the atropine group, and by 2 or more lines in three participants and 17 participants, respectively. Altogether, 17 participants experienced mild visual acuity reduction of the sound eye that did not require treatment in the patching group compared to 47 in the atropine group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> 'Harms of treatments at 6 months follow up in PEDIG 2002'). Only one child in the atropine group was actively treated for reduction in visual acuity in the initially sound eye. Many cases of decreased sound eye acuity in the atropine group appeared to be associated with improper refractive correction combined with a residual cycloplegic effect of the atropine (<LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>). This was supported by subsequent follow-up examinations in which 40 out of 45 participants had a same or a better visual acuity than that at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> reported one case of reverse amblyopia for the atropine group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:04:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular visual impairment in both children and young to middle-aged adults (<LINK REF="REF-Attebo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attebo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1996</LINK>). Occlusion therapy with patching of the sound eye has been the mainstay of amblyopia treatment, although the success of occlusion depends heavily on compliance. Occlusion therapy has been prescribed in varying regimens, ranging from a few hours a day to full-time patching, from partial occlusion to total occlusion, as a stand alone therapy, or in conjunction with another therapy. Atropine penalization has been studied in clinical trial settings as an alternative to occlusion therapy for amblyopia. This method involves instillation of atropine sulphate into the sound eye to prevent accommodation and so therefore induces blurred vision for near fixation. The accompanying dilation of the pupil also enhances this image degradation. The practical benefit of atropine penalization is its ease of administration, reliable assessment of compliance, and its relative cheapness. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize available RCT evidence with regard to effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic penalization compared to atropine therapy in treating amblyopia.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:04:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>In this systematic review, evidence from three clinical trials (one assessed as having a low risk of bias) suggests both conventional occlusion and atropine penalization produce visual acuity improvement in the amblyopic eye. Atropine penalization appears to be as effective as conventional occlusion, although the magnitude of improvement differed among the three trials.</P>
<P>Specifically, <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> found patching and atropine produce improvement in visual acuity of similar magnitude at six and 24 months. At six months, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved from baseline 3.16 lines in the patching group and 2.84 lines in the atropine group, and the difference between treatment groups was small and clinically inconsequential (MD 0.034 logMAR; 95% CI 0.005 to 0.064 logMAR). At 24 months, additional improvement was seen in both treatment groups (3.7 lines in the patching group and 3.6 lines in the atropine group), and there continued to be no difference between groups in mean visual acuity score (MD 0.01 logMAR; 95% CI &#8722;0.02 to 0.04 logMAR). <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> reported atropine to be more effective than optical penalization. At six months, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved 1.8 lines in the patching group and 3.4 lines in the atropine group, and the difference between treatment groups was in favor of atropine (MD -0.16 logMAR; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.09 logMAR). However, it is difficult to compare these two trials directly due to the differing methods used for occlusion. Participants of <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> were prescribed total occlusion where as those in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> were prescribed partial occlusion by means of optical penalization. It is unclear whether the two treatments are as effective as each other. <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> had methodological flaws and we could not draw meaningful inference from the data reported.</P>
<P>Comparing across trials, although atropine was prescribed daily in <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> and twice weekly in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK>, the magnitude of improvement in visual acuity in amblyopic eyes treated by atropine was comparable between these two trials. This was not unexpected. A recent trial (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2004</LINK>) has shown that weekend atropine provides a similar improvement in vision to daily atropine for participants aged between three to seven years with moderate amblyopia. Interestingly, the magnitude of improvement differed substantially in eyes treated by conventional occlusion. The inherent clinical heterogeneity between the two trials may explain some of these observed differences. First, the two trials used different patching protocols. <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK> prescribed a minimum of six hours daily occlusion with 20% participants prescribed 12 hours over the initial six month period. Excellent compliance was documented in 49% of cases. <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> used partial occlusion by positive defocusing of the sound eye. One of the main weaknesses of this study was compliance assessment, which was not easy to address for the partial occlusion because of difficulty in reporting frequency of peeking over glasses. Therefore, it was likely the effects of partial occlusion was compromised by poor compliance. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> lost 10% (7/70) of total participants. The analyses ignored issues arising from missing data. Moreover, these two trials included slightly different study populations. Children in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> were one year older on average. Fifty-one per cent of children in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> had strabismus as the cause of amblyopia, compared to 38% in <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>. Baseline visual acuity in the amblyopic eye was 0.42 logMAR in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 2008</LINK> and 0.51 logMAR in <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>. Older age at commencement of treatment, worse starting visual acuity, and strabismus as the cause of amblyopia have been related to poorer response to amblyopia treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiscox-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiscox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 1994</LINK>). Therefore, these observed differences in the distribution of baseline characteristics may explain to some extent the heterogenous treatment effect observed in the conventional occlusion arm of the two trials.</P>
<P>With regard to binocular function, evidence from this systematic review suggested no difference between patching and atropine penalization in ocular alignment and stereo acuity. Compliance to treatment was better in atropine penalization than conventional occlusion, and both treatments were well tolerated by the child and family. Effect of treatment on visual acuity in the sound eye was comparable between two treatments. Lastly, the cost of the atropine regimen is likely to be less than that of the patching regiment, however, to date no cost-effectiveness has been carried out on the two treatment regimes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of the evidence and limitations</HEADING>
<P>This review systematically synthesized evidence from randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials for the effectiveness and safety of conventional occlusion therapy compared to pharmacological penalization in treating amblyopia. Limitations to our systematic review mainly stemmed from the clinical heterogeneity and the methodological quality of the included studies. Clinical heterogeneity was reflected in differences in the study population, including the age of participants, baseline visual acuity, cause of amblyopia, previous amblyopia treatment, and variations in the treatment regimen. In addition, except for <LINK REF="STD-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEDIG 2002</LINK>, the trials included had some methodological flaws. <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1997</LINK> was assessed as having a high risk of bias because of inadequate random sequence generation and inadequate allocation concealment. Such clinical heterogeneity and methodological limitations made it difficult to pool the effect estimates in a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>This systematic review provided an up-to-date summary of best available evidence for doctors, patients and other decision makers about the effectiveness and safety of conventional occlusion versus atropine penalization for treating amblyopia. Current research suggests that atropine is as effective as conventional occlusion for the treatment of amblyopia and therefore should be used as first line treatment for amblyopia. Evidence from the included trials suggests that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Atropine penalization provides an equal improvement in visual acuity as conventional occlusion for moderate amblyopia in children.</LI>
<LI>Atropine penalization may provide a greater improvement in visual acuity compared to conventional occlusion for moderate amblyopia; however, this result should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample size and methodological limitations of the trial.</LI>
<LI>There is no difference in ocular alignment and stereo acuity between atropine penalization and conventional occlusion.</LI>
<LI>Compliance with treatment appears to be greater for those prescribed atropine penalization as opposed to conventional occlusion.</LI>
<LI>Conventional occlusion and atropine penalization have similar reported rates of adverse event.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:08:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This systematic review identified key gaps in research, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Long-term stability of treated amblyopia and the risk of reoccurrence of amblyopia.</LI>
<LI>Comparision between different methods of occlusion to determine whether they are comparable, such as partial occlusion and total occlusion.</LI>
<LI>Improved methods of documenting compliance to treatment, especially for those undergoing conventional occlusion.</LI>
<LI>Further research into the effect of age, type of amblyopia and density of amblyopia for both atropine and conventional occlusion.</LI>
<LI>Cost-effectiveness analyses comparing atropine penalization and conventional occlusion.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The first two topics are being investigated in ongoing studies. The results from these studies will help to clarify the long-term effectiveness and safety of atropine and occlusion therapy, as well as the relative effectiveness of partial versus total occlusion. We will update our review when results from those studies become available.</P>

Adhesive skin patches provided by the study (Coverlet Eye Occlusors; Beiersdorf-Jobst Inc, Rutherford College, NC) were used unless there was skin allergy or irritation non-responsive to both local treatment with a skin emollient and a change in the brand of patch, in which case a spectacle occluder could be prescribed.</LI>
