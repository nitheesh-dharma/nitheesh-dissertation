<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-19 19:04:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a novel synthetic estrogen receptor (ER) ligand, which may be useful for women with uterine fibroids. Three randomised clinical trials evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of SERMs are included in this review. However, due to the small number of participants in the included studies, inconsistency in findings, and the poor quality of the evidence, the authors were not able to recommend their use or non-use in women with uterine fibroids. No new studies were identified in the updated seach and there are no new findings for this updated review.</P>

<P>Uterine fibroids are benign tumours that arise from individual smooth muscle cells of the uterus. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are estrogen receptor (ER) ligands that act as estrogens in some tissues while blocking estrogen activity in others. There have been many clinical studies of various SERMs for uterine fibroids. However, their effectiveness is controversial.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-19 18:58:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Register of Chinese trials developed by the Chinese Cochrane Centre, and the Chinese Med Database (Chinese Biomedical Disc), VIP, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We handsearched a number of journals and searched reference lists, and searched databases of ongoing trials and the Internet. The searches were conducted in March and April 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-05-09 16:24:13 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Taixiang Wu">
<P>We included randomised controlled studies of selective estrogen receptor modulators versus other forms of medical therapy, placebo or no treatment in women of reproductive age (18 to 45 years old) with confirmed uterine fibroids.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-20 20:25:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar, we did not do a meta-analysis but summarised the data in a narrative format.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-19 19:01:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies involving 215 participants were included, the trial size varied from 25 to 100 women. The SERM in all cases was raloxifene. In one study women in both arms received gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. Comparison interventions included no treatment and placebo. Two of the three included studies found a significant benefit from raloxifene, but the third study found no benefit at three or six-month follow-up. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low. All three studies mentioned adverse reactions but data were limited.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-25 15:20:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no consistent evidence from the limited number of studies that SERMs reduce the size of fibroids or improve clinical outcomes. Further studies are required to establish evidence of benefit of SERMs in treating women with uterine fibroids. This updated review did not find any new study for inclusion.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-19 19:06:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine leiomyomas or myomas, are benign tumours that arise from individual smooth muscle cells of the uterus. Their incidence depends upon the ethnic background of the population examined (<LINK REF="REF-Borgfeldt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borgfeldt 2000</LINK>). In women of reproductive age, the incidence is reported as varying from 5.4% to 77% depending on the method of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2002</LINK>). In spite of their benign neoplastic character, uterine fibroids account for significant morbidity in up to 50% of cases. Prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, urinary disturbances or constipation caused by pressure upon adjacent organs, or problems related to pregnancy such as repeated pregnancy loss and infertility are commonly reported (<LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The initiating factor(s) and the pathogenesis of fibroids are not well established. However, estrogen and progesterone play an important role in tumour growth and maintenance in addition to hormonal cyclic changes (<LINK REF="REF-Farber-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farber 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otubu-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otubu 1982</LINK>). Estradiol and progesterone receptors have been identified in myomatous tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamaya-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamaya 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vollenhoven-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollenhoven 1994</LINK>) and therapeutic hormonal manipulation may be an effective management strategy for fibroids. It is believed that decreased estrogen secretion could lead to reduction in the growth and maintenance of fibroids, or even their regression.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-23 11:39:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In women with symptoms, surgical and medical interventions, including uterine artery embolization, are options for management (<LINK REF="REF-Ravina-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravina 1995</LINK>). Surgical treatment involves either excising the fibroid in an operation called a myomectomy or removing the entire uterus (hysterectomy). Medical treatment usually involves lowering estrogen; gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, danazol or progesterone can all reduce estrogen causing the fibroids to shrink in size (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1992</LINK>). However, these hormonal preparations are not suitable for long term treatment due to deleterious side effects. GnRH is associated with problems including increased loss of bone density (Stewart 1992) and can cause side effects similar to menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, loss of periods and vaginal dryness. In addition, when the drug treatment is stopped the fibroids usually return to their original size (<LINK REF="REF-Matta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matta 1989</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-23 11:40:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>SERMs are estrogen receptor (ER) ligands that act as estrogens in some tissues while blocking estrogen activity in others. Thus, SERMs may exhibit bivariate effects, agonistic or antagonistic depending on the context in which their activity is examined (<LINK REF="REF-Dutertre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutertre 2000</LINK>). Most estrogen effects are mediated by specific receptors of which two subtypes have been identified, ER alpha and ER beta. These are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors (<LINK REF="REF-Gustafsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustafsson 1999</LINK>). Although the exact mechanism of action of SERMs has not yet been fully understood, it has been hypothesized that these agents work by inducing conformational changes in the estrogen receptor, which results in differential expression of specific estrogen-regulated genes in different tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Mitlak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitlak 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The biologic character of an individual SERM is determined by structure; the type of ER to which it binds; and the set of molecules that interact with the ER-SERM complex in a particular cell. This in turn determines whether the SERM is fully agonistic or antagonistic (<LINK REF="REF-Dutertre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutertre 2000</LINK>). For example, raloxifene has the ability to maintain beneficial estrogenic activity on bone and lipids and anti-estrogenic activity on endometrial and breast tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>), while another kind of SERM, tamoxifen, acts as an ER agonist in the uterus and bone and as an antagonist in the mammary gland (<LINK REF="REF-Dutertre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutertre 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Another SERM, raloxifene, is used to treat uterine fibroids because of its distinct lack of proliferative effects on endometrial tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Boss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boss 1997</LINK>). Raloxifene can be rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with an absolute bioavailability of about 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>). Although it experiences extensive systemic biotransformation, it does not appear to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway. It has a prolonged plasma elimination half-life of up to 27 hours which is attributed to the drug's reversible systemic metabolism and significant enterohepatic cycling (<LINK REF="REF-Eli-Lilly-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eli Lilly 1997</LINK>). As raloxifene is eliminated primarily in the faeces and only minimal amounts are found in the urine, dosage adjustments are not required in individuals with renal insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>).<BR/>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-23 11:42:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been many clinical studies of various SERMs for uterine fibroids (<LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jirecek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jirecek 2004</LINK>). However, there is no conclusive evidence so far to support the use of SERMs for uterine fibroids. On the other hand, there is evidence to indicate that SERMs are not risk-free (<LINK REF="REF-Draper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delmas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delmas 1997</LINK>). There are concerns regarding adverse effects such as hot flushes and leg cramps as well as an increased risk of thromboembolic events (<LINK REF="REF-Draper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delmas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delmas 1997</LINK>). Therefore, a systematic evaluatIon of their benefits and harms is needed.</P>

<P>LYD, XLX and CXY independently extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. We extracted data on study characteristics including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We resolved all disagreements by referring to the trial report and through discussion, or by consulting the CMDSG. If data from the trial reports were insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors for additional information.</P>
<P>If possible, we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis (the analysis included all the participants in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned). If the number randomised and the number analysed were inconsistent, we calculated the percentage loss to follow-up and reported this information. For binary outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, for each group we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations. If the data were reported using geometric means, we extracted standard deviations on the log scale. Medians and ranges were extracted and reported in tables.</P>

<P>LYD, XLX and CXY selected the trials to be included in the review. We assessed the methodological risk of bias as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence when provided in sufficient detail to make one of the following judgements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table, computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the process of concealing the allocation when provided in sufficient detail and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed each outcome or class of outcomes for the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported; the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants); reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported; and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We could make these judgements where sufficient information was reported, or it was supplied by the trial authors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias: trials where few dropouts or losses to follow-up were noted and an intention-to-treat analysis is possible;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias: the rate of exclusion was at least 20%, or wide differences in exclusions between groups whatever the intention-to-treat analysis used;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more of the reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<P>A 'risk of bias summary' graph and figure are included (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). We assessed the impact of individual bias domains on study results at both endpoint and study levels.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-08-20 20:19:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For binary outcomes, we used the number of participants experiencing the event in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RRs). For continuous outcomes, for each group we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations. If data were reported using geometric means we planned to extract standard deviations on the log scale. If necessary, we planned to extract medians and ranges and report them in tables. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales, we planned to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD). We planned to treat ordinal data (for example quality of life scores) as continuous data. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.</P>
<P>Where data to calculate RRs or mean differences (MDs) were not available, we planned to utilise the most detailed numerical data available that might facilitate similar analyses of included studies (for example test statistics, P values). We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they are presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-08-23 11:55:39 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As we did not identify a sufficient number of high quality randomised controlled trials, and as outcome measures were reported in various ways that could not easily be converted into a standard measure, we did not undertake a meta-analysis. Data were summarised in a narrative format. Different comparisons were analysed separately.</P>
<P>If there are data available for meta-analysis in future versions of this review, we will proceed as follows. We will analyse the data using Review Manager and a fixed-effect model. We will compare outcome measures for binary data using relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. For continuous data, we will use the mean difference (MD). If continuous data has been reported using geometric means, we will combine the findings on a log scale and report on the original scale. We will report medians and ranges in tables only.</P>
<P>If it is appropriate to pool data and heterogeneity is detected, we will use the random-effects model. We do not intend to combine results of trials with different comparator drugs. Potential bias will be tested for using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants in the studies ranged from 25 to 100. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jirecek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jirecek 2004</LINK>) enrolled premenopausal women with asymptomatic uterine fibroids and regular menstrual bleeding patterns. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2002</LINK>) included healthy premenopausal women with ovulatory menstrual cycles ranging from 26 to 30 days and presence of no more than two asymptomatic uterine fibroids measuring more than 20 mm at transvaginal ultrasonography (TV-USG). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2002a</LINK>) enrolled women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.

<P>We found that the studies examined were of poor quality; and none of them clearly described allocation concealment. The studies did not assess all of the outcome measures we wished to examine. The studies identified used varying dosages of SERMs and different co-interventions, and were therefore not easily comparable. Two studies appear to show a benefit for reducing fibroid size. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jirecek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jirecek 2004</LINK>) was of SERM versus no treatment, however the number of participants was quite small. <LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2002a</LINK> was of SERM plus GNRH agonist (GnRHa) versus GnRHa and concluded that SERM administration induced a greater reduction in fibroid size. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2002</LINK>) showed no difference between low or high-dose SERM versus placebo.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-23 12:09:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were only a small number of studies included in this review, few adhered to the criteria recommended in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>), and they were of marked clinical heterogeneity. One of the studies was very small and lacked a placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Jirecek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jirecek 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focused on SERMs as a means of fibroid treatment. However, raloxifene was the only SERM used in the three included studies. Although it is the most widely used and most practical for use, it may not be suitable for all situations. It may therefore be more useful to compare all the different types of SERMs to give a more complete picture. We intend to do this in a future version of this review if this information becomes available.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events were observed in the included studies. However, leg pain must be taken seriously in women taking raloxifene, as the most serious adverse effect is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Leg cramps were reported by 4% of the women taking raloxifene (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2002</LINK>). In the MORE study, the relative risk for a thromboembolic event was 3.1 (95% CI 1.5 to 6.2) compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Ettingrr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ettingrr 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to conclude that SERMs reduce the size of fibroids or improve clinical outcomes, in view of the questionable quality and small number of included studies. As the safety of SERMs is uncertain due to the limited reporting of adverse reactions, SERMs should be used with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-20 20:50:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More high quality controlled trials (following the CONSORT criteria) are required for assessing the effects of SERMs in comparison to other forms of fibroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>). These studies should also address the question of the most effective dose to be used (under given conditions). Studies should be adequately powered, last at least six months, and include participants of all ages. The outcomes studied should not be restricted to fibroid size and fibroid-related symptoms but should include other outcome measures specified above, such as quality of life and recurrence rate. Special attention should be paid to adverse effects.</P>
