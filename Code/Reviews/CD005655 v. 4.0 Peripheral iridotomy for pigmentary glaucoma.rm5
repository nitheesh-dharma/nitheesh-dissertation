<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>What are the effects of peripheral laser iridotomy compared with other treatments or no treatment for patients with pigment dispersion syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Glaucoma is a chronic eye condition associated with vision loss over time. One of the major risk factors for glaucoma is increased pressure in the eye, known as ocular hypertension. In eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS), particles from the iris (colored part of the eye) break off from the iris and are deposited on other parts within the eye. Sometimes, these particles block the flow of fluid out of the front portion of the eye, leading to ocular hypertension. Pigmentary glaucoma is a specific form of glaucoma that may be found in patients with PDS. Topcial medical therapy is usually the first-line treatment; however, peripheral laser iridotomy has been proposed as an alternate treatment.</P>
<P>Peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that is performed with a laser. A laser light beam is used to burn a small hole in the iris to create an opening for free movement of fluid within the front portion of the eye. The goal of this procedure is to reduce pressure within the eye, thereby reducing the chance of glaucoma and/or vision loss. However, it is unknown whether peripheral iridotomy reduces the development or progression of pigmentary glaucoma in practice.</P>
<P>
<B>Study details</B>
<BR/>We searched different electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of peripheral iridotomy in people with PDS or pigmentary glaucoma. We included five trials with a total of 260 eyes of 195 participants. Searches were up to date as of 2 November 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We found no clear benefit for peripheral laser iridotomy versus no laser in eyes with PDS or pigmentary glaucoma in terms of preventing loss of visual field. Very low-quality evidence suggests that laser iridotomy may be more effective in lowering pressure within the eye when compared with no laser iridotomy for up to 10 years after treatment. Few adverse effects were reported among participants in these trials; the most commonly reported adverse events were mild postoperative inflammation and cataract.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>We graded the quality of evidence as very low as the result of poor reporting of study methods, incomplete information for meaningful analysis of data, and variation in outcomes assessed among trials. In conclusion, evidence is inadequate to support the use of peripheral iridotomy as treatment for pigmentary glaucoma. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of peripheral iridotomy for PDS and pigmentary glaucoma.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-12 03:18:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cell death resulting in damage to the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer. Pigment dispersion syndrome is characterized by a structural disturbance in the iris pigment epithelium (the densely pigmented posterior surface of the iris) that leads to dispersion of the pigment and its deposition on various structures within the eye. Pigmentary glaucoma is a specific form of open-angle glaucoma found in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome.</P>
<P>Topcial medical therapy is usually the first-line treatment; however, peripheral laser iridotomy has been proposed as an alternate treatment. Peripheral laser iridotomy involves creating an opening in the iris tissue to allow drainage of fluid from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber and vice versa. Equalizing the pressure within the eye may help to alleviate the friction that leads to pigment dispersion and prevent visual field deterioration. However, the effectiveness of peripheral laser iridotomy in reducing the development or progression of pigmentary glaucoma is unknown.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:31:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five RCTs (260 eyes of 195 participants) comparing yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser iridotomy versus no laser iridotomy. Three trials included participants with pigmentary glaucoma at baseline, and two trials enrolled participants with pigment dispersion syndrome. Only two trials reported the country of enrollment: one - Italy, the other - United Kingdom. Overall, we assessed trials as having high or unclear risk of bias owing to incomplete or missing data and selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>Data on visual fields were available for one of three trials that included participants with pigmentary glaucoma at baseline. At an average follow-up of 28 months, the risk of progression of visual field damage was uncertain when comparing laser iridotomy with no iridotomy (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.16 to 6.25; 32 eyes; very low-quality evidence). The two trials that enrolled participants with pigment dispersion syndrome at baseline reported the proportion of participants with onset of glaucomatous visual field changes during the study period. At three-year follow-up, one trial reported that the risk ratio for conversion to glaucoma was 2.72 (95% CI 0.76 to 9.68; 42 eyes; very low-quality evidence). At 10-year follow-up, the other trial reported that no eye showed visual field progression.</P>
<P>One trial reported the mean change in intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes with pigmentary glaucoma: At an average of nine months of follow-up, the mean difference in IOP between groups was 2.69 mmHg less in the laser iridotomy group than in the control group (95% CI -6.05 to 0.67; 14 eyes; very low-quality evidence). This trial also reported the mean change in anterior chamber depth at an average of nine months of follow-up and reported no meaningful differences between groups (mean difference 0.04 mm, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.15; 14 eyes; very low-quality evidence). No other trial reported mean change in anterior chamber depth. Two trials reported greater flattening of iris configuration in the laser iridotomy group than in the control group among eyes with pigmentary glaucoma; however, investigators provided insufficient data for analysis. No trial reported data related to mean visual acuity, aqueous melanin granules, costs, or quality of life outcomes.</P>
<P>Two trials assessed the need for additional treatment for control of IOP. One trial that enrolled participants with pigmentary glaucoma reported that more eyes in the laser iridotomy group required additional treatment between six and 23 months of follow-up than eyes in the control group (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.75; 46 eyes); however, the other trial enrolled participants with pigment dispersion syndrome and indicated that the difference between groups at three-year follow-up was uncertain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.17; 105 eyes). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as very low.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Two trials reported that no serious adverse events were observed in either group among eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome. Mild adverse events included postoperative inflammation; two participants required cataract surgery (at 18 and 34 months after baseline), and two participants required a repeat iridotomy.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 22:28:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found insufficient evidence of high quality on the effectiveness of peripheral iridotomy for pigmentary glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. Although adverse events associated with peripheral iridotomy may be minimal, the long-term effects on visual function and other patient-important outcomes have not been established. Future research on this topic should focus on outcomes that are important to patients and the optimal timing of treatment in the disease process (eg, pigment dispersion syndrome with normal IOP, pigment dispersion syndrome with established ocular hypertension, pigmentary glaucoma).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cell death and consequent damage to the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer. Vision loss may occur with development of progressive visual field defects. Intraocular pressure (IOP) higher than eye tissue susceptibility is the main risk factor for glaucoma; elevation of IOP usually results from impairment of aqueous humor drainage. Aqueous humor, a clear fluid that nourishes the eye, is secreted by the ciliary body into the posterior chamber of the eye, passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber, and is drained via the trabecular meshwork.</P>
<P>Several origins have been proposed for elevated IOP associated with glaucoma. Blockage of the aqueous fluid at the trabecular meshwork by the iris is known as angle closure. Glaucoma consequent to angle closure is referred to as angle-closure glaucoma. Glaucoma with no evidence of angle closure on gonioscopy is termed open-angle glaucoma. Pigmentary glaucoma is a specific secondary form of open-angle glaucoma that occurs in eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome. It was first described as a distinct clinical entity in 1949 by Sugar and Barbour (<LINK REF="REF-Sugar-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 1949</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pigment dispersion syndrome is characterized by a structural disturbance in the iris pigment epithelium (the densely pigmented posterior surface of the iris) that leads to dispersion of the iris pigment (melanin granules) and its deposition on various structures within the eye. Friction between the iris and the lens zonules (suspending fibers of the lens) results in mechanical disruption of the iris pigment epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 1993</LINK>). Loss of integrity of the retinal pigment epithelial cell/photoreceptor complex in eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome may contribute to pigment dispersion (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstein 2001</LINK>). The liberated pigment is deposited on lens zonules, anterior and posterior lens surfaces, iris, cornea, and trabecular meshwork. The deposited pigment contributes to damage to the trabecular meshwork over time, impeding the outflow of aqueous humor. This buildup of aqueous humor may lead to elevated IOP and associated glaucomatous optic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarado-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarado 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grant-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1977</LINK>). This process usually occurs bilaterally.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma are prevalent in many parts of the world, although they affect primarily white myopes (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 1993</LINK>). It is estimated that pigmentary glaucoma affects 0.5% to 5% of people with glaucoma in the Western world (<LINK REF="REF-Ritch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2001</LINK>). Pigmentary glaucoma was found in 0.6% of a cohort of 176 people with glaucoma (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01% to 3%) in the Congo (<LINK REF="REF-Kaimbo-Wa-Kaimbo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaimbo Wa Kaimbo 1997</LINK>). The prevalence of pigment dispersion syndrome is higher; in a population screening study of 374 participants in Israel, 5.9% (95% CI 3.7% to 8.8%) had excessive corneal endothelial pigmentation (<LINK REF="REF-Gaton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaton 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pigment dispersion syndrome affects men and women almost equally, with a slight predominance among men. Most people with pigmentary glaucoma are men, and the disease tends to develop at an earlier age among men than among women (<LINK REF="REF-Migliazzo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migliazzo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheie-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheie 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2001</LINK>). Pigmentary glaucoma is diagnosed most commonly in the third and fourth decades of life, although the average age of onset is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Speakman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speakman 1981</LINK>). Young age, male gender, and myopia have been found to be significant risk factors associated with the development of pigmentary glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Migliazzo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migliazzo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richter-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 1986</LINK>). In different retrospective studies, pigmentary glaucoma was reported to occur in 10% to 50% of people with pigment dispersion syndrome within five years of follow-up, and in approximately 15% by 15 years of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Migliazzo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migliazzo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siddiqui-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiqui 2003</LINK>). One prospective study reported pigmentary glaucoma in 18% of participants with pigment dispersion syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is postulated that pigment dispersion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetration (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The classic triad of clinical signs in pigment dispersion syndrome consists of (1) a Krukenberg spindle (pigmented iris cells deposited on the posterior surface of the cornea); (2) slit-like, radial, mid-peripheral iris transillumination defects; and (3) pigment deposition on the trabecular meshwork (<LINK REF="REF-Sugar-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 1949</LINK>).</P>
<P>In eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome, the iris tends to have a concave configuration and often is inserted into the posterior ciliary body band. Mechanical friction between anterior pockets of lens zonules and the peripheral iris during normal pupillary activity results in pigment dispersion from the iris (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1979</LINK>). The iris acts as a flap-valve, allowing flow of aqueous from the posterior to the anterior chamber but not in the reverse direction, causing a reverse pupillary block, which results in posterior bowing of the iris, iris-zonular touch, and consequent pigment release (<LINK REF="REF-Karickhoff-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karickhoff 1992</LINK>). The flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, against the pressure gradient, is assisted by blinking (<LINK REF="REF-Liebmann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebmann 1995</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1995</LINK>), and accommodation (<LINK REF="REF-Pavlin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlin 1996</LINK>). Pigment dispersion syndrome associated with elevated IOP is usually defined as pigmentary ocular hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Niyadurupola-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niyadurupola 2008</LINK>), whereas pigmentary glaucoma presents with typical signs of pigment dispersion syndrome along with characteristics of glaucomatous optic nerve damage (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarado-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarado 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grant-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1977</LINK>). Patients usually have no subjective symptoms until the very late stages of optic atrophy and visual field loss.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-12-21 07:08:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First-line medical therapy for patients with elevated IOP, particularly in the face of diminished trabecular meshwork drainage, consists of prostaglandin therapy. Prostaglandins lower IOP by increasing uveo-scleral outflow, and offer the advantage of once-daily administration. Another common therapy is aqueous suppression with a topical beta-blocker. In theory, parasympathomimetics could decrease relative pupillary block, relieve irido-zonular contact, and diminish pigment liberation; however, strong miotics rarely are tolerated by young individuals because of the associated spasm of accommodation and blurring of vision. Other medical interventions include alpha-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</P>
<P>Alternatives to medications for the management of pigmentary glaucoma include laser procedures, such as argon laser trabeculoplasty and peripheral laser iridotomy. With trabeculoplasty, a laser is used to burn selected areas of the trabecular meshwork to increase aqueous outflow and lower IOP. Peripheral laser iridotomy involves creating an opening in the iris tissue to serve as an alternate conduit for drainage of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber and vice versa.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-12 03:12:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Effects of peripheral laser iridotomy are believed to be due to alleviation of the reverse pupillary block mechanism following equalization of pressure between anterior and posterior chambers. This equalization of pressure may allow the iris to flatten, thereby decreasing irido-zonular contact and friction that lead to pigment dispersion syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Laemmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laemmer 2008</LINK>). Deposition of pigment on the trabecular meshwork would be eliminated or minimized, and aqueous humor drainage could occur unimpeded.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-02 19:24:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of peripheral laser iridotomy in reducing the development or progression of pigmentary glaucoma is unknown. Although alleviating the reverse pupillary block mechanism may result in equalization of pressure between anterior and posterior chambers; exercise and other factors may cause pigment dispersion. Peripheral laser iridotomy does not directly correct underlying anatomical defects such as concavity of the iris or changes to the trabecular meshwork from exposure to pigmentary deposition that occurred before the procedure was performed. A systematic review of the evidence is needed to evaluate the usefulness of peripheral laser iridotomy in pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:11:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The protocol for this review described independent assessment of methodological quality by two review authors, consistent with an earlier version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. When the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> was revised during the review process, we adapted our assessments according to corresponding risk of bias domains. We followed criteria provided in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>) to determine "high," "low," and "unclear" risk of bias within each included trial for each of the following domains: selection bias (sequence generation and allocation concealment before randomization), detection bias (masking of outcome assessors), attrition bias (rates of follow-up and handling of missing data), and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each trial and resolved disagreements through discussion.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We considered any method of allocation concealment (eg, centralized randomization, use of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes) that provided reasonable confidence that the allocation sequence had been concealed from physicians enrolling patients to be adequate and at "low" risk of bias. Whenever the adequacy of allocation concealment was unclear from the trial report, we contacted the trial investigators to request clarification. If they did not respond within two weeks, we categorized the trial on the basis of available information.</LI>
<LI>We assessed masking of visual field and IOP outcome assessors in the included trials. Masking of investigators and participants may not have been possible with the interventions examined and was not assessed.</LI>
<LI>We judged whether missing data had been handled appropriately in the analysis of data from included trials. Our judgements considered rates of follow-up, reasons for loss to follow-up, and analysis by the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT). We assessed whether follow-up rates for treatment and control arms were similar, and whether outcomes from all participants were analyzed and with the group to which they had been randomly assigned.</LI>
<LI>We assessed selective outcome reporting by comparing reported study results versus outcomes specified in protocols, clinical trial registries, and/or published design and methods papers. When no document prespecifying study outcomes was available, we assessed risk of bias for selective outcome reporting as unclear.</LI>

<P>IOP was measured during follow-up by a masked observer in <LINK REF="STD-Gandolfi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gandolfi 1996</LINK>, and by an unmasked observer in <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2011</LINK>; therefore, we judged these trials as having low risk and unclear risk of detection bias, respectively. The remaining three trials did not report information about masking; thus we judged them to have unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>One of three trials that included participants with pigmentary glaucoma at baseline reported the proportion of participants with progression of visual field loss (<LINK REF="STD-Uva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uva 1996</LINK>). At an average follow-up of 28 months (range 12 to 37), 2/16 eyes in the laser group and 2/16 eyes in the control group showed progression of visual field damage and underwent trabeculectomy (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.25).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:59:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found five trials (260 eyes of 195 participants) that had evaluated peripheral iridotomy with yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser compared with no laser iridotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gandolfi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gandolfi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgopoulos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Georgopoulos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uva 1996</LINK>). Data were sparse for outcomes targeted for this systematic review, and too few trials reported outcomes in a similar manner for meta-analysis. Among the included trials, no clear benefit was reported for laser iridotomy compared with no laser in eyes with pigmentary glaucoma for visual field loss or pigment dispersion syndrome in terms of preventing visual field progression. Very low-quality evidence indicates that laser iridotomy may lower intraocular pressure (IOP) for up to 10 years compared with no laser in eyes with pigmentary glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome, and that eyes with pigmentary glaucoma treated with laser iridotomy may show a flatter iris configuration than control eyes. Little to no clinical difference between groups was observed for change in anterior chamber depth or pigment accumulation in the trabecular meshwork in eyes with pigmentary glaucoma. Differences between treatment groups in the need for additional topical medication were inconsistent in the two trials that reported this outcome. Few adverse effects were reported among participants in these trials; the most commonly reported adverse events were mild postoperative inflammation and cataract.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 19:25:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For most outcomes specified for this review, sparse or no data were available for analysis. Information for two of five trials was available only in conference abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Georgopoulos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Georgopoulos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uva 1996</LINK>), which provided limited details on study methods, participant characteristics, and outcome measures. Follow-up times across trials ranged from six months to 10 years, and no two trials assessed the same outcome at the same follow-up time, precluding meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A major issue in the applicability of evidence is the variation in participants' conditions at baseline: Three trials included participants with pigmentary glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgopoulos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Georgopoulos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uva 1996</LINK>), and two trials enrolled participants with documented pigment dispersion syndrome with varying IOP criteria and different levels of risk at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Gandolfi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gandolfi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2011</LINK>). Such heterogeneity limits evidence synthesis and the ability to reach robust conclusions. Along the continuum that leads from pigment dispersion syndrome to pigmentary glaucoma, different pathogenic stages can be recognized. In early stages, dispersed pigment obstructs the trabecular meshwork, and pigment granules are progressively phagocytized by trabecular endothelial cells. Outflow obstruction identified at this early phase may be reversible. At late stages of disease, the trabecular endothelial cells become overloaded with pigment and, subsequently, become necrotic and die. Loss of cells causes trabecular meshwork beam collapse, which may result in a consequential increase in IOP. Trabecular meshwork damage at this stage is probably irreversible. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that treatment with laser peripheral iridotomy may have different success rates at different stages of disease. Such treatment may prevent progression of the disease when pigment dispersion is still the main contributory factor (as at early stages of pigment dispersion syndrome) and may be less effective at advanced stages, when trabecular damage as well as ocular hypertension is already established (as in individuals with pigment dispersion syndrome with elevated IOP or pigmentary glaucoma).</P>
<P>Data also were not available to allow subgroup analyses to assess the effects of other potentially important factors, such as participant age and disease severity at baseline. With aging, pigment dispersion tends to be reduced as a consequence of increased axial length, age-related miosis, and a general reduction in accommodation.</P>

<P>Although risks of laser peripheral iridotomy may be minimal, this systematic review found no high quality evidence for or against the usefulness of iridotomy for improving long-term outcomes of visual field loss in pigmentary glaucoma and visual field progression in pigment dispersion syndrome.Possible reduction in iris concavity and irido-zonular contact with less pigment dispersion may not mitigate existing dysfunction of the trabecular meshwork nor lead to a significant reduction in long-term visual function loss. However, laser peripheral iridotomy may have long-term beneficial effects on IOP in eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome and in eyes at high risk of IOP decompensation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-02 19:25:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on laser peripheral iridotomy versus other treatment or no treatment in eyes with pigmentary glaucoma are needed. Available data are too sparse and scarcely representative of the whole disease continuum to allow for robust conclusions. Improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of this condition could help practitioners to identify which individuals would be more likely to benefit from laser peripheral iridotomy, and could reveal when in the disease process the procedure should be done. Careful differentiation of baseline characteristics (eg, pigment dispersion syndrome with normal IOP, pigment dispersion syndrome with established ocular hypertension, pigmentary glaucoma) seems essential when treatment effects are assessed at different stages of the condition. Furthermore, trials should investigate subgroup analysis for important co-variates such as age and iris concavity.</P>
<P>As with other forms of glaucoma, another important issue for future researchers to consider is the outcome definition. IOP represents a surrogate outcome, which may be indicative of the pathophysiological event occurring in the eye but may not reflect outcomes of greatest importance to patients. Progression of visual field loss and incidence of glaucomatous visual field damage may be outcomes most relevant to assessment of treatment effects with iridotomy. Therefore, long-term follow-up (at least three years) would be important for measuring visual field changes in future studies. Other outcomes associated with IOP changes include the number of melanin granules in the aqueous humor (<LINK REF="REF-Mardin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardin 2000</LINK>). Moreover, use of the opposite eye as a control for participants who have elevated IOP or pigmentary glaucoma in both eyes raises ethical issues. One would be ethically bound to treat any eye with a very high IOP or signs of optic nerve damage.Pigmentary glaucoma, like most glaucomas, tends to be asymmetrical, and so one eye (the worse eye) could be more prone to damage than the other. It is thus more practical to randomly assigned individuals instead of eyes.</P>
