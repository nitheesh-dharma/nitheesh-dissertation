<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-15 12:29:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Modifying fat in our food (replacing some saturated (animal) fats with plant oils and unsaturated spreads) may reduce risk of heart and vascular disease, but it is not clear whether monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats are more beneficial. There are no clear health benefits of replacing saturated fats with starchy foods (reducing the total amount of fat we eat). Heart and vascular disease includes heart attacks, angina, strokes, sudden cardiovascular death and the need for heart surgery. Modifying the fat we eat seems to protect us better if we adhere in doing so for at least two years. It is not clear whether people who are currently healthy benefit as much as those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (people with hypertension, raised serum lipids or diabetes for example) and people who already have heart disease, but the suggestion is that they would all benefit to some extent.</P>

<P>Reduction and modification of dietary fats have differing effects on cardiovascular risk factors (such as serum cholesterol), but their effects on important health outcomes are less clear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-03-29 04:17:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>To assess the effect of reduction and/or modification of dietary fats on mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and individual outcomes including myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer diagnoses in randomised clinical trials of at least 6 months duration.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-05-17 14:54:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>For this review update, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched through to June 2010. References of Included studies and reviews were also checked. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-03-29 04:17:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group, 2) intention to reduce or modify fat or cholesterol intake (excluding exclusively omega-3 fat interventions), 3) not multi factorial, 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease, 5) intervention at least six months, 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-11 18:11:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm were extracted independently in duplicate and random effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, sub-grouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots were performed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-17 15:34:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>This updated review suggested that reducing saturated fat by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96, 24 comparisons, 65,508 participants of whom 7% had a cardiovascular event, I<SUP>2</SUP> 50%). Subgrouping suggested that this reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies of fat modification (not reduction - which related directly to the degree of effect on serum total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), of at least two years duration and in studies of men (not of women). There were no clear effects of dietary fat changes on total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04, 71,790 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, 65,978 participants). This did not alter with sub-grouping or sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Few studies compared reduced with modified fat diets, so direct comparison was not possible.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-23 16:02:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups, should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturates. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-07 04:12:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-17 14:59:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>In 1949 Ryle and Russell in Oxford documented a dramatic increase in coronary heart disease, and the Registrar General&#8217;s Statistical Tables of 1920 to 1955 showed that there had been a 70-fold increase in coronary deaths during this 35 year period (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryle-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryle 1949</LINK>). This sudden surge in coronary heart disease sparked research into its causes. A case control study published in 1953 of 200 post-myocardial infarction patients and age-matched controls established that those with disease had higher LDL cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1953</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meanwhile in 1949 in the US Gofman had separated lipids into lipoprotein classes through ultra centrifugation, describing the low density lipoproteins (LDL) as &#8216;atherosclerogenic&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Gofman-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gofman 1949</LINK>). The following year Keys proposed that the concentration of plasma cholesterol was proportional to dietary saturated fat intake (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1950</LINK>), and this relationship was confirmed in work by Hegsted (<LINK REF="REF-Hegsted-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegsted 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hegsted-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegsted 2000</LINK>) who published an equation explaining the relationship in 1965 and subsequently in 2000, suggesting that dietary saturated fat increases serum cholesterol and so increases cardiovascular risk, while polyunsaturated fats reduce both (this has since been further refined):</P>
<P>&#916; serum cholesterol (in mg/dl) = 2.16 * &#916; dietary saturated fat intake (as percentage of energy) &#8211; 1.65 * &#916; dietary polyunsaturated intake (as percentage of energy) + 6.77 * &#916; dietary cholesterol intake (in units of 100mg/day) &#8211; 0.53</P>
<P>The Seven Countries Study compared CHD mortality in 12000 men aged 40-59 in seven countries and found positive correlations between CHD mortality and total fat intake in 1970, then in 1986 between CHD mortality and saturated fat intake (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thorogood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorogood 1996</LINK>). A migrant study of Japanese men confirmed in 1974 that men in California had the diet richest in saturated fat and cholesterol, and the highest CHD rates, those in Hawaii had intermediate diet and CHD rates, and those in Japan had a diet lowest in saturated fat and cholesterol, and the least CHD (<LINK REF="REF-Kagan-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagan 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1977</LINK>).  However, recent systematic reviews of the observational data have not confirmed these early studies. <LINK REF="REF-Skeaff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeaff 2009</LINK> included 28 US and European cohorts (including 6600 coronary heart disease deaths among 280,000 participants) investigating the effects of total, saturated, monounsaturated, trans and omega-3 fats on coronary heart disease deaths and events. They found no clear relationship between total, saturated or monounsaturated fat intake and coronary heart disease events or deaths. There was evidence that trans fats increased both coronary heart disease events and deaths, and that total polyunsaturated fats and omega-3 fats decreased them. <LINK REF="REF-Siri_x002d_Tarino-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siri-Tarino 2010</LINK> included 21 prospective epidemiologic studies assessing the relationship between saturated fats and coronary heart disease, stroke and cardiovascular disease, finding that saturated fat intake was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease, stroke or cardiovascular disease. Observational studies are potentially powerful at providing associations between dietary factors and cardiovascular risk, but the scale of measurement error is such that detecting such effects may be difficult. Thus intervention studies are needed to clarify cause and effect, to ensure that confounding is not either hiding or generating true relationships. Trials also directly address the issue of whether altering dietary fat in adults is helpful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the general population and in those at high risk. It is essential that intervention trials form the basis of evidence based practice in this area.</P>
<P>Most intervention studies have assessed the effect of dietary interventions on risk factors for heart disease, and separate work ties the effect of altering these risk factors to changes in disease incidence and mortality. Systematic review in this area follows the same pattern, so that there are systematic reviews of the effect of dietary fat advice on serum lipid levels (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brunner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denke 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kodama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kodama 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shafiq-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafiq 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weggemans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weggemans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu_x002d_Poth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu-Poth 1999</LINK>) suggesting that dietary changes cause changes in serum lipids and reviews on the effect of lipid level alterations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Briel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Caterina-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Caterina 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubins 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1995</LINK>), suggesting that changes in lipids do affect cardiovascular risk. Other risk factors dealt with in a similar way are blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2007</LINK>), body weight or fatness (<LINK REF="REF-Astrup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astrup 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hession-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hession 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1996</LINK>), angiographic measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 1994</LINK>), antioxidant intake (<LINK REF="REF-Ness-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ness 1997</LINK>), metabolic profile (<LINK REF="REF-Kodama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kodama 2009</LINK>) and alcohol intake (<LINK REF="REF-Rimm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimm 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A problem with this two-level approach is that any single dietary alteration may have effects over a wide range of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. An example of this is the choice of substitution of saturated fats by carbohydrate, polyunsaturated fats or monounsaturated fats in the diet. This choice may alter lipid profile, and may also affect blood pressure, body weight, oxidative state, rate of cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts, insulin resistance, post-prandial triacylglycerol response, blood clotting factors, and platelet aggregation. There may also be further risk factors of which we are not yet aware. Evidence of beneficial effect on one risk factor does not rule out an opposite effect on another unstudied risk factor, and therefore an overall null (or harmful) effect of intervention. While understanding the effects of dietary advice on intermediate risk factors helps to ensure diets are truly altered by advice, and illuminates mechanisms, the best way of combining the effects on all of these risk factors is to not study risk factors, but to study the effects of dietary change on important outcomes, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and on total mortality.</P>
<P>Substantial randomised controlled trial data on the effects of dietary fat on mortality and morbidity does exist - the first version of this systematic review included over 18,000 participants in trials of at least six months duration, reporting on over 1400 deaths, over 800 cardiovascular deaths, and over 1200 cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2001</LINK>). The review found no clear relationship between fat modification (reduction of saturated fats, including studies that replaced the missing calories with carbohydrates - low fat diets - and studies that replaced the missing calories with other fats - modified fat diets) and total or cardiovascular mortality, but did find that such modification reduced the rate of cardiovascular events by around 16% (rate ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99 compared with usual diet). Since 2000 several important new studies have been published. These include some very large studies that have modified dietary fat intake in women over several years (including the Women's Health Initiative that included over 2000 women with, and over 48,000 women without, cardiovascular disease at baseline for over eight years (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>) and the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study including over 3000 women for 11 years (<LINK REF="STD-WHEL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WHEL 2007</LINK>)) allowing us to add a substantial body of new research on low fat diets (many of the large studies included in the first version of the review were of modified fat diets rather than reduced fat diets), as well as information on the effects of these changes in women (as previous large studies were mainly in men). The results of WHI in particular have raised many questions about both the effects of fat on health and on how we best conduct research to understand the relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Michels-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michels 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yngve-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yngve 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Public health dietary advice on prevention of cardiovascular disease has changed a little over time, with a focus on fat modification during the 1960s and fat reduction during the 1990s. Recent recommendations by the American Heart Association suggest that, among other dietary measures, Americans should "limit intake of saturated fat to 7% of energy, trans fat to 1% of energy, and cholesterol to 300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats" (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>How effective are these alterations in dietary fat at reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality? Should we replace the energy from saturated and trans fats with carbohydrates, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats?</P>
<P>This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of reducing or modifying dietary fat on mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events, as well as on individual cardiovascular outcomes and total cancers, and cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally we used the whole database of studies to use meta-regression to explore effects of changes in total, saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, trans, weight and study duration on the primary outcomes. Finally we included studies that directly compare reduced with modified dietary fats.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-05-17 12:56:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of change in dietary fats, which would be expected to result in lipid lowering, on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials. For this update interventions were classified as low fat, modified fat or combined low and modified fat diets and effects of each type of dietary intervention were assessed.</P>
<P>
<B>Specific questions</B> included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does reducing saturated fat intake, by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat, in the longer term (at least six months) reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (or individual health events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes or cancer)?</LI>
<LI>Does a long term reduced fat diet, compared with usual diet, reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (or individual health events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes or cancer)?</LI>
<LI>Does a long term reduced fat diet alter classic cardiovascular risk factors (weight, body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, serum total, LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglyceride)?</LI>
<LI>Does a long term modified fat diet, compared with usual diet, reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (or individual health events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes or cancer)?</LI>
<LI>Does a long term modified fat diet alter classic cardiovascular risk factors (weight, body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, serum total, LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglyceride)?</LI>
<LI>Does reducing and modifying dietary fat (as a combined intervention) in the longer term reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (or individual health events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes or cancer)?</LI>
<LI>Does a long term reduced and modified fat diet (as a combined intervention) alter classic cardiovascular risk factors (weight, body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, serum total, LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglyceride)?</LI>
<LI>Are effects on mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity moderated by differences in baseline cardiovascular risk, mode of intervention, control group total fat intake, control group saturated fat intake, gender, setting or decade of publication, or changes in total fat intake, saturated fat intake, polyunsaturated fat intake, monounsaturated fat intake, trans fat intake, dietary cholesterol, weight, serum LDL cholesterol, or study duration?</LI>
<LI>Is a long term reduced fat diet or a modified fat diet more effective in reducing mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (or individual effects such as myocardial infarction, stroke or cancer diagnoses)?</LI>
<LI>Is a long term reduced fat diet or a modified fat diet more acceptable to people trying to adhere to these diets?</LI>
<LI>Is a long term reduced fat diet or a modified fat diet more effective in altering classic cardiovascular risk factors (weight, body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, serum total, LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglyceride)?</LI>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-17 15:04:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>All randomised controlled trials of interventions stating an intention to reduce or modify dietary fat or cholesterol, such as would be expected to result in improvement of serum lipid profile, were considered. These included an intention to reduce total fat intake, modify fat intake (while maintaining total fat intake), and reduction and modification of fat intake, all compared to a usual diet type control or modification of dietary fat compared to reduced total fat. The intervention had to be dietary advice, supplementation (of fats, oils or modified or low fat foods) or a provided diet, and the control group usual diet, placebo or a control diet.</P>
<P>A low fat diet was considered to be one that aimed to reduce fat intake to &lt; 30%E from fat, and at least partially replace the energy lost with carbohydrates (simple or complex), protein or fruit and vegetables. A modified fat diet was considered to be one that aimed to include 30% or more energy from total fats, and included higher levels of mono-unsaturated or poly-unsaturated fats than a 'usual' diet.</P>
<P>Interventions excluded (unless they were present in addition to those above) were addition of alpha-linolenic acid, omega-3 fats or fish oils (as the effect of these is dealt with in a separate review), high fibre diets and garlic (as pulses, fruits and vegetables may have various effects other than lipid lowering) or exploration of varying forms of carbohydrate (unless also specifically low in fat or fat modified). Also excluded were all multiple risk factor interventions other than diet or supplementation (unless the effects of diet or supplementation could be separated, as in a factorial design, so the additional intervention was consistent or randomised between the intervention and control groups), and studies that aimed for weight loss in one arm but not the other. Atkins-type diet aiming to increase protein and fat intake were excluded, as were studies where fat was reduced by means of a fat-substitute (like Olestra). Enteral and parenteral feeds were excluded, as were formula weight reducing diets.</P>
<P>Examples: studies that reduced or modified fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with encouraging physical activity in the control were included; studies that reduced or modified fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were excluded; studies that reduced or modified fats and encouraged fruit and vegetables in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were included.</P>

<P>The initial searches were run in March to June 1998 and included <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAB Abstracts, CVRCT Registry, SIGLE, bibliographies and experts. A comprehensive search strategy was developed to search for nutrition based randomised controlled trials with morbidity or mortality outcomes.</P>
<P>MEDLINE on SilverPlatter was searched for randomised controlled trials on diet and cardiovascular disease or mortality from 1966 to May 1998. An additional MEDLINE (SilverPlatter 1966 to June 1998) search strategy was run to collect papers where only lipid outcomes were mentioned (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of both searches). These search strategies were adapted for use on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 2, 1998), EMBASE (Ovid online to May 1998), the CVRCT Registry (May 1998), CAB Abstracts (Ovid online, 1973 to March 1998) and SIGLE (to January 1999). Published systematic reviews addressing diet and heart health were sought as a source of RCTs using similar strategies on MEDLINE (Silver Platter, 1966-March 1998) and <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 1998).</P>
<P>Cochrane Review Groups in areas related to this review include the Diabetes Group (now the Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders Group), Stroke Group, Renal Group, Hypertension Group and Peripheral Vascular Disease Group. The groups were contacted and asked to search their trial registers for relevant trials.</P>
<P>The review authors updated the searches in June 2010, and modified searches were run on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE. Modification was due to altered database accessibility as well as altered recommended RCT filters. The searches for the earlier review were run as a wider search for studies for several reviews (including a variety of dietary factors), the recent searches were focused on dietary fat interventions only. As databases other than these three had not provided any included studies during the first version of the review, and the numbers of titles and abstracts were not feasible to handle for the update, these were the only databases used for this update. The search strategies used for the update search are shown in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-06-07 03:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>We did not include any cluster randomised trials in this review, and cross-over studies (such as the Finnish Mental Hospital study, <LINK REF="STD-Finnish-Mental-Hosp-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Finnish Mental Hosp 1972</LINK>) were excluded as this design would be inappropriate for assessing effects on cardiovascular events or mortality.</P>
<P>Where there was more than one relevant intervention arm but only one control arm the relevant intervention arms were either pooled to create a single pair-wise comparison (where the intervention arms were equivalently appropriate for this review) as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Intervention arms that were not appropriate for this review, or less appropriate than another arm, were excluded. When two arms were appropriate for different subgroups then the control group was used once with each intervention arm, but the subgroups were not pooled overall.</P>
<P>When assessing event data we aimed to avoid counting more than one outcome event for any one individual within any one comparison.

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-01-23 13:06:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the outcomes of our review were often not the planned outcomes of relevant trials (many studies with relevant methods, participants, intervention, control and duration had other primary and secondary outcomes, so mortality and morbidity were reported in many studies only as reasons for dropout, or not reported at all), we tried to contact the authors of all identified studies that were appropriate for inclusion on the basis of participants, intervention, comparison and methodology, to ask about mortality and morbidity, the review's primary and secondary outcomes. This allowed inclusion of many studies that would otherwise have had to be omitted. Studies which were otherwise relevant but where presence or absence of primary outcomes could not be established were retained in the section of studies awaiting classification.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-06-07 03:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>The data within the original review were in the form of rates. Treatment effect was measured as a rate ratio and meta-analysis performed as a weighted average of (ln) rate ratios (as described by <LINK REF="REF-Hasselblad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasselblad 1995</LINK>). For trials with a zero in one arm of the data a small number (0.5) was added to the number of events in both groups.Meta-analysis was performed using random effects methodology (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) within S-PLUS (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 1999</LINK>). For the update of the review we checked that using event data gave similar results to rate data as described above - using the same studies the outcomes of the meta-analysis using Mantel-Haenszel random effects methods were almost identical (presence or absence of statistical significance was never different, and scale of effect size was always similar). For this reason, within the update, numbers of events in each study arm, and total number of participants randomised, were extracted, and Mantel-Haenszel random effects meta-analysis carried out in Review Manager software. Event and continuous outcome data were extracted for the latest time point available within the trial (and always at least six months from inception).</P>
<P>Trials where it was known that there were no events in either intervention group were included in the review for completeness, but were not included in the meta-analysis (where it was stated that no events of particular type occurred this was detailed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). These studies inclusion or otherwise would not influence the results of the review. Where trials ran one control group and more than one included intervention group, data from the intervention group providing the comparison that best assessed the effect of altering dietary fat was used. Where the intervention groups appeared equal in this respect the intervention groups were merged (simply added for dichotomous data, and using the techniques described in the <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> for continuous data). It was planned that if trials randomized by cluster were identified the patient numbers would be reduced to an "effective sample size" (as described by <LINK REF="REF-Hauck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauck 1991</LINK>), however none were identified that were both included and had cardiovascular events or deaths.</P>

In total there were 60 comparisons included in the review.</P>
<P>The main study papers ranged in publication date from 1965 to 2009, and the comparisons were conducted in North America (30), Europe (26), Australia/ New Zealand (3) and the Middle East (1). Ten of the comparisons included only people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, 17 at moderate risk, and 33 at low risk. Sixteen comparisons included only men, 14 only women, and 30 both men and women.</P>
<P>Dietary interventions varied from trials which provided dietary advice (in varying degrees of intensity and duration, 35 studies), provided advice plus some dietary supplementation (such as oils or margarines, nine studies), to studies that provided most food eaten by participants (via institutional provision, meals provided for those living independently or study shops, 16 studies). The setting for most studies was the community (in that participants were living in the community - the actual setting for provision of advice, group work etc was usually unclear, although interventional advice was occasionally clearly in a home or community setting, and occasionally in a primary or secondary healthcare setting), but three studies took place in institutions (<LINK REF="STD-Minnesota-Coron-men-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Minnesota Coron men 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minnesota-Coron-women1989" TYPE="STUDY">Minnesota Coron women1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NDHS-Faribault-1968" TYPE="STUDY">NDHS Faribault 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Admin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Admin 1969</LINK>), and no studies appeared to have been carried out in occupational settings.</P>

A further 36 intended to monitor lipids, blood pressure, weight or other cardiovascular risk factor outcomes, seven aimed to assess effects on cancers or cancer related outcomes such as polyps, two the feasibility of dietary intake, and the remaining three studies aimed to assess bile acid kinetics or diabetic retinopathy. Of the 48 included studies, nine recruited participants with cardiovascular disease (were secondary prevention studies), 12 recruited those at increased risk of CVD (including those recruited on the basis of raised lipids, blood pressure or weight), and 25 recruited people from the general population or without specific CVD risk (primary prevention). A further two studies recruited a mix of participants (at high and lower CVD risk).</P>
<P>Of the 51 comparisons of a modified and/or low fat diet with a control or usual diet, four measured the total fat intake in the control arm as less than 30% of energy (30%E), 18 30% - 34.9%E, 19 35% - 39.9%E, six had a control arm with at least 40%E, and it was unclear what the total fat intake in the control arm was in the remaining four comparisons. Three of the included comparisons had a saturated fat intake in the control group of less than 10% of energy (10%E), 19 10% - 14.9%E, 14 15% - 19.9%E and one comparison 20+%E, while saturated fat intake in the control group was unclear in a further 14 comparisons.</P>
<P>Of the 60 intervention arms only 21 provided data on mortality (including 71,790 participants and 4292 deaths), 16 on cardiovascular mortality (65,978 participants and 1407 cardiovascular deaths), and 23 on combined cardiovascular events (65,508 participants and 4887 events).

<P>Blinding of participants is not easy in dietary studies, as the participants usually have to follow instructions to attain the specific dietary goals. However, it is feasible in some circumstances, including when food is provided via an institutional setting, or meals provided at a central setting and remaining meals packed to take away, through use of a trial shop, where very specific food-based dietary advice is provided for all participants, or where the same dietary advice is provided to both groups but a different supplement (e.g. dietary advice to reduce fats, then provision of different oils or fats) is provided. Where participants are not blinded it is difficult to ensure that study staff, health care providers and outcome assessors are blinded.

<P>Assessing whether incomplete outcome data have been addressed was difficult as the primary outcomes for this review were often seen as dropouts and exclusions from the original studies. When mortality and/or cardiovascular events were noted in any one study it is still feasible that some participants left that study feeling unwell or because the diet was inconvenient (so were simply lost to follow up from the perspective of the study) and later died or experienced a cardiovascular event. However, in some cases studies checked medical records or death registers to ensure that such events were all collected (these 10 studies included <LINK REF="STD-DART-1989" TYPE="STUDY">DART 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NDHS-Faribault-1968" TYPE="STUDY">NDHS Faribault 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-Diet_x002d_Heart-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo Diet-Heart 1966</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PREMIER-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PREMIER 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-Diet_x002d_Heart-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney Diet-Heart 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-THIS-DIET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">THIS DIET 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Admin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Admin 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHEL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WHEL 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WINS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WINS 2006</LINK>).

<P>Assessment of selective reporting is difficult when the outcome of interest is simply a cause of dropouts in most included studies. We tried to contact all of the trialists to ask about deaths and outcome events, but it is possible that some trialists did not reply as they felt that their data did not reflect the expected or hoped for pattern of events. All of the included studies have either reported that the participants did not experience any of our primary outcomes, published their outcome data or have provided the data they did possess.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Total mortality</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear effect of any dietary fat intervention compared to usual or control diet on mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 71,790 participants, 4292 deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.53, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Similarly there was no effect of modified fat vs usual diet (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18, I<SUP>2</SUP> 34%, 11,441 participants, 1120 deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.81), reduced fat vs usual diet (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 58,130 participants, 2936 deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.42), or reduced and modified fat vs usual diet (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 2219 participants, 236 deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.78).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses (using Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects relative risk meta-analysis, Peto odds ratio (fixed effects), removing the largest single study (WHI), removing studies with a systematic difference in care between the intervention and control arms, and removing studies with dietary differences between arms other than in dietary fat intake) did not alter the lack of statistically significant effect overall or for modified fat intake, reduced fat intake or reduced and modified fat intake compared with usual or control diet (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The funnel plot does not suggest severe small study bias, although there may be some smaller studies missing suggesting increased total mortality in the intervention group (so addition of any such studies would further lessen the likelihood of a protective effect of dietary fat modification or reduction on mortality). The funnel plot is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>No important effects of reduced and/or modified fat diets compared to usual or control diets on mortality were seen when studies were subgrouped by duration (mean duration up to two years or over two years), cardiovascular risk (low, moderate or high cardiovascular risk), mode of intervention (dietary advice, advice plus supplementation or diet provided), total fat in the control group (less than 30% of energy from fat, 30% - 34.9%E, 35% - 39.9%E or 40%E and over from fat), saturated fat in the control group (less than 10% of energy from saturated fat, 10% - 14.9%E or 15% - 19.9%E from saturated fat), by gender (studies of men, of women and of men and women combined), by setting (community or residential institution, no studies of workplaces were identified) or by year of first publication of results (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We explored the effects of dietary fats on total mortality, by using meta-regression of the difference between the control and intervention of duration, total fat intake, saturated fat intake, monounsaturated fat intake, polyunsaturated fat intake, trans fat intake (all by percentage of energy), weight (in kg) and serum LDL cholesterol (in mmol/L) achieved in trials. The results of all meta-regressions are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. As only two trials reported trans fat intakes achieved by study arm meta-regression on trans fats could not be carried out, and with only six of the studies reporting serum LDL cholesterol levels achieved the power of this analysis to suggest a result was limited. Because so few studies reported LDL cholesterol, we also ran a post-hoc meta-regression by total serum cholesterol (as a surrogate for LDL cholesterol) achieved in each arm. We did not observe any clear relationships between treatment-control group differences in dietary or serum characteristics and mortality, but power for this analysis was limited.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cardiovascular mortality</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear effect of any dietary fat intervention compared to usual diet on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 65,978 participants, 1407 cardiovascular deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.23), <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>. Again, there was no effect within any dietary fat subgroup: modified fat diet vs usual diet RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.15, I<SUP>2</SUP> 45%, 10,788 participants, 593 cardiovascular deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.46); reduced fat vs usual diet RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.13, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 52,971 participants, 602 cardiovascular deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.65); or reduced and modified fat vs usual diet RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.27, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 2219 participants, 212 cardiovascular deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.88), <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the lack of clear effects of modified fat intake, reduced fat intake, reduced and modified fat intake or all combined compared to usual or control diets on cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgrouping (as above) did not suggest important effects of reduced and/or modified fat diets on cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We explored the effects of dietary fats on cardiovascular mortality in meta-regression (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). There were insufficient studies to explore the effects of trans fats. As only six of the studies reported serum LDL cholesterol levels achieved, we also ran a post-hoc meta-regression by total serum cholesterol (as a surrogate for LDL cholesterol) achieved in each arm. We did not observe any clear relationships between duration, weight, any dietary or serum characteristics and mortality, but power for this analysis was limited.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cardiovascular events </HEADING>
<P>There was a reduction in cardiovascular events for any dietary fat intervention compared with usual diet (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96, I<SUP>2</SUP> 50%, 65,508 participants, 4887 people with cardiovascular events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.007) <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>. Sensitivity analyses, using Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-analysis, Peto fixed effects odds ratio, and removing the largest study comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>) maintained this clear effect of the intervention, while removing studies with a systematic difference in care between the intervention and control arms, or removing studies with dietary differences other than dietary fat differences both removed the statistical significance of the effect (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A funnel plot did not suggest severe small study (or publication) bias, but it is likely that a few small studies with more cardiovascular events in the intervention groups may be missing from the review (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the subgroups of types of dietary fat change showed a clear effect of dietary fat change compared with usual diet in its own right, but the effects in both groups that included modification of fat were of marginal significance: modified fat vs usual fat RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> 61%, 11,660 participants, 855 people with CVD events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.07); reduced and modified fat vs usual diet RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.03, I<SUP>2</SUP> 40%, 3193 participants, 400 people with events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.08). There was no suggestion of an effect on cardiovascular events in studies that compared reduced fat vs usual intake (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> 17%, 50,655 participants, 3632 people with CVD events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.55).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses of the modified fat studies, using Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects relative risk meta-analysis suggested a strong and statistically significant effect of modified fat on cardiovascular events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93, I<SUP>2</SUP> 61%, 11,660 participants, 855 events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.002), as did the Peto odds ratio, and using fixed effects meta-analysis on the reduced and modified fat subgroup suggested risk reduction of 16% and of marginal statistical significance (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00, I<SUP>2</SUP> 40%, 3193 participants, 400 events, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.05, also reiterated by the Peto odds ratio analysis). Removing studies with systematic differences in care between intervention and control groups, or other dietary differences, both removed statistical significance. No sensitivity analyses of the reduced fat intake compared with control or usual diet suggested important or statistically significant effects (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>As multiple analyses were run for sub-grouping, only those subgroups statistically significant to P &lt; 0.01 are reported here (and in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) as being statistically significant. Subgrouping by duration suggested no important effect in studies with duration of two years or less, but a clear and statistically significant effect in studies of more than two years duration. There was little suggestion of different effects of fat modification and/or reduction in those at low, moderate or high cardiovascular risk. Subgrouping suggested a strong effect of dietary advice plus supplementation, only marginal effect in those given dietary advice (without supplementation, but often with high levels of support and encouragement), and no effect in those provided with their food (via shops or group eating). There was no clear effect of baseline total fat intake on cardiovascular events. Many studies did not report saturated fat intakes, and sub-grouping by saturated fat intake in the control group did not result in important effects. Dietary fat intervention reduced cardiovascular events in men, but not in women or in combined studies of men and women, and studies in community settings reduced events, but those in residential institutions did not. Studies published in the 1960s, and in the 1990s, reduced cardiovascular events significantly, but not studies published in other decades (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We explored the effects of dietary fats on cardiovascular events, by using meta-regression of the difference between the control and intervention of total fat intake, saturated fat intake, monounsaturated fat intake, polyunsaturated fat intake, trans fat intake (all by percentage of energy), weight (in kg) and serum LDL cholesterol (in mmol/L) achieved in trials (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Meta-regression of trans fats was not feasible due to lack of trials. As only seven studies reported LDL cholesterol, we also ran a post-hoc meta-regression by total serum cholesterol (as a surrogate for LDL cholesterol) achieved in each arm. As studies of shorter duration appeared to have less effect on events than longer interventions, we also performed a second post-hoc analysis, in which we carried out the meta-regression on duration alongside each dietary or serum factor. We did not observe any clear relationships between any dietary or serum characteristic and cardiovascular events (with or without co-regression on duration), but power for these analyses were limited.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Total myocardial infarction</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear effect of altering dietary fat intakes (compared to usual diet) on myocardial infarction (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> 6%, 64,891 participants, 2068 people with fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarcts, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Neither was there any effect of any of the distinct dietary fat changes: modified fat intake RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.16, I<SUP>2</SUP> 45%, 11,831 participants, 579 people with at least one myocardial infarct, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.46); reduced fat vs usual fat intake RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 50,522 participants, 1203 people having a myocardial infarct, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.54); and reduced and modified fat vs usual intake RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 2538 participants, 286 people with myocardial infarcts, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.32).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stroke</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of an effect of general dietary fat advice (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 59,853 participants, 1140 people with at least one fatal or non-fatal stroke, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.87), or modified, reduced or both vs usual diet on stroke (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). As 95% of the weight of this analysis was due to inclusion of the WHI trial (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>), we also checked the effect of dietary fat advice on stroke excluding both parts of this study, and there was the suggestion of an effect of dietary change on stroke (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 11,018 participants, 64 people with a stroke, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.06).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cancer deaths</HEADING>
<P>There was no effect of altering dietary fat intakes on cancer deaths (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06, I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%, 65724 participants, 2818 cancer deaths, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.66), or of any specific type of fat changes, although there was a marginally significant effect of modified fat intake increasing cancer deaths, although this included only 91 cancer deaths (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cancer diagnoses</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of an effect of altered dietary fat intake on cancer diagnoses (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> 1%, 59,082 participants, 6115 people with at least one cancer diagnosis, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Almost all the evidence on cancer diagnoses come from studies that reduced dietary fat, and only 138 diagnoses were made in studies where modified fat or reduced and modified fat interventions had been undertaken.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Diabetes diagnoses</HEADING>
<P>Most data on diabetes diagnoses came from the WHI study, and neither the study itself, or the combined data set suggested that the intervention reduced the risk of diabetes being diagnosed (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, 49,859 participants, 3367 diabetic diagnoses, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Non-fatal myocardial infarction</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of an effect of reduced and/or modified dietary fat vs usual fat diet on people diagnosed with at least one non-fatal MI, overall or within any subgroup of fat change (overall RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12, I<SUP>2</SUP> 21%, 54,883 participants, 1403 people with at least one infarct, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.55 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Few studies considered quality of life. The Women's Health Initiative assessed quality of life at baseline using the SF-36 tool, but we were unable to find whether quality of life was compared between dietary intervention and control groups during the study. The <LINK REF="STD-Ole-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ole Study 2002</LINK> did not use a formal quality of life tool, but asked participants about their feelings about the diet they were on. They provided a scale of 1 (dislike extremely) to 7 (like extremely). Of the 13 control participants (eating meals 5 days per week in the study centre, with other meals in takeout containers) 6 participants were neutral about the diet (neither like nor dislike, 4 on the scale), and the remaining control participants were a little mor positive, choosing number 5 or 6. Results were very similar in the low fat group, with 5 being neutral, 8 choosing 5 or 6 on the scale, and one choosing 3 (a little on the negative side of neutral).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tertiary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Note that the effects of dietary fat changes on tertiary outcomes discussed below represent a subset of all trials - we have only included assessment of effect of dietary interventions on these outcomes presented in studies that reported on occurrence of deaths and/or cardiovascular events (the review's primary or secondary outcomes). These outcomes are reported here as providing information on the potential mechanisms of any effects of dietary fat changes and also on whether participants adhered appropriately to their allocated interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Weight and Body Mass Index (BMI)</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies, including 99 participants, assessed the effects of modified fat intake compared to usual diet on weight, and did not find any clear effect (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). One of these studies, and an additional study (116 participants in total) assessed the effect of a modified fat diet on BMI, again finding no clear effect (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sixteen studies (11,058 participants) compared reduced fat diets with usual diets and assessed effects on weight, finding a significant reduction in weight in those on low fat diets compared to usual diets (MD -0.83kg, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.30, I<SUP>2</SUP> 54%, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.002). Similarly, the ten comparisons of reduced fat with usual intake found a reduction in BMI in those on the reduced fat diets (MD -0.47kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.23, I<SUP>2</SUP> 51%, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.0002).</P>
<P>No studies assessed the impact of reduced and modified fat intakes compared to usual diets on weight, and only two studies (111 participants) assessed impact on BMI, finding no clear effect (MD -0.20kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.91, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, p<SUB>effect</SUB> 0.73).</P>
<P>In understanding the causative pathway between dietary advice or provision and mortality or morbidity it is useful to understand whether intermediate outcomes are being modified. Within this review this is complicated by the problem that some studies experienced outcomes, but did not report intermediate markers, and other studies experienced no events, but reported intermediate outcomes. For this reason we carried out a post-hoc analysis of the intermediate markers (tertiary outcomes) only for the studies that reported the primary outcomes. These are reported briefly below for weight and BMI, confirming clear and statistically significant reductions in both weight and BMI for those on reduced fat diets compared with control, but with no studies reporting these outcomes for modified or reduced and modified fat diets:</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-17 13:44:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggested that dietary fat manipulation (reduction and/or modification) may be protective of cardiovascular events, reducing them by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96, 24 comparisons, 65,614 participants, with marginal heterogeneity, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This was moderate GRADE evidence (See summary of findings, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Subgrouping suggested that this reduction in cardiovascular events was due to studies of fat modification, or fat modification and reduction (not studies of fat reduction alone), seen in studies of at least two years duration, in studies of men (and not those of women), and in those with moderate or high cardiovascular risk at baseline (not general population groups).</P>
<P>Despite a large number of participants involved in randomised controlled trials of at least six months duration there were no clear effects of dietary fat changes on total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04, 21 comparisons, 71,795 participants, without important heterogeneity, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, 16 comparisons, 65,983 participants, without important heterogeneity, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This did not alter with sub-grouping or sensitivity analysis, and was moderate GRADE evidence (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few studies directly compared reduced fat diets with modified fat diets, and only three trials reported on cardiovascular events, so direct comparison of these two diets in randomised controlled trials was not possible (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The stronger effect of modified fat diets over reduced fat diets in reducing serum lipids may relate to the apparently stronger effect of modified fat diets than reduced fat diets on cardiovascular events. It is not clear from the included studies whether this is due to the greater intrinsic effect of modified fat diets on cardiovascular events, or that modified fat diets are easier to comply with than reduced fat diets.</P>
<P>Meta-regression did not suggest any clear effects of changes in any dietary fat component (total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats) or serum lipids (LDL or total cholesterol) on mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (data on trans fats were not available, and those on LDL cholesterol were very limited, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>No effects of dietary fat manipulation overall, or modifying or reducing dietary fat intake, were seen on risk of myocardial infarction, stroke or cancer diagnosis (GRADE moderate evidence, see <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), nor non-fatal myocardial infarction, diabetes diagnosis or cancer deaths, and little information on the effect of diet on quality of life was found. However, reduced fat diets caused significant reductions in weight, body mass index, LDL and total cholesterol, with no change in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood pressure. Fat modified diets appeared to reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides, but there was no evidence of effects on weight, body mass index, LDL or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure (although few fat modification studies measured or reported these outcomes in ways that allowed meta-analysis). Modification of fat appeared did not alter classic CVD risk factors when directly compared to low fat diets. Studies that aimed to reduce and modify fat intake appeared to reduce total and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, but there was no suggestion of improvements in body mass index or HDL cholesterol and little data on blood pressure.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-11 15:20:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included adult participants at varying levels of risk of cardiovascular disease, men and women, in free-living and institutional settings, and across the past 50 years. Almost all the studies were conducted in industrialised countries, and almost no data were available from developing or transition countries. The effectiveness of reduced fat diets and modified fat diets have been well assessed (trials of at least 6 months included 62,000 and 13,000 participants respectively), but studies of the combined diet (reduced and modified fat) included fewer than 5000 participants. Over 4000 participants in the included trials died, 1400 died of a cardiovascular cause, and almost 5000 experienced at least one cardiovascular event.</P>
<P>Overall the external validity of the review in industrialised countries, men and women, people with low, moderate and high risk of cardiovascular disease was high, but it is not clear how this evidence relates to diets in developing and transition countries.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-05-17 13:45:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All 48 trials and 60 comparisons included were randomised controlled trials, allocation concealment was judged well done in 26 comparisons, and 11 had adequate participant and study personnel blinding (difficult and expensive in dietary trials), see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Ten comparisons ensured compete outcome data through checking of medical records or death registers, and we attempted to contact all trialists to ascertain deaths and cardiovascular events (that were often not important outcomes for the original studies). Just under half of the included comparisons (29) were free of systematic differences in care between study arms, and 39 were free of dietary changes other than those relating to dietary fat.</P>
<P>The lack of blinding in most dietary trials is unlikely to alter outcome assessment when outcomes include death and cardiovascular events, but lack of blinding in the participants may have lead those in the control groups to alter their lifestyle and dietary practices (for example, feeling that they have not been helped to reduce their cardiovascular risk, they may act to reduce their own risk by altering other lifestyle behaviours such as smoking or exercise, leading to a potential lessening of the apparent effect of the dietary intervention). Systematic differences in care between arms may have lead to intervention groups receiving additional support in areas like self-efficacy and gaining support from new social circles, potentially beneficial to health regardless of dietary fat intake, or gaining additional health care professional time, possibly leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment of other risk factors such as raised blood pressure. Additional dietary messages (such as those around fruit and vegetable intake, fibre, alcohol and sugars), present in many studies, may have been protective, or may have diluted the effect and/or attainability of the fat goals.</P>
<P>This suggests that the evidence base for the dietary effects of changes in dietary fats on cardiovascular risk is not ideally valid, although it is large. In light of the uncertainty over allocation concealment, lack of blinding and presence of systematic differences in care and additional dietary differences between arms, the quality of evidence cannot be described as high (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). On the other hand, the scale and consistency of the evidence across studies and across decades, with very different designs and design flaws may make up for these deficits to some extent. For this reason, it is likely that the review provides robust conclusions on the effects of dietary fat modification in industrialised countries.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complex interventions</HEADING>
<P>With complex interventions, such as dietary ones, there are additional questions that need to be asked about included studies. Important issues to consider include defining the intervention, searching for and identifying all relevant studies, selecting studies for inclusion and data synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lenz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheppherd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppherd 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this review we have worked to define the interventions clearly (see Characteristics of studies table), providing information on the type of intervention, stating the study aims and methods for each arm and the assessed total and saturated fat intakes attained within the study. However, while we have characterised the interventions (for example, sub-grouping studies into those that aimed to reduce, modify or reduce and modify dietary fat) no two studies that reduced dietary fat had exactly the same dietary goals for the intervention groups. Methods of attaining the dietary goals varied from providing a whole diet over several years (in studies based in institutions); to providing shops that sold either full or low fat versions of foods depending on the intervention or control status of the participant; to providing advice on diet alongside supplementary foods such as margarines or oils; to providing dietary advice with or without supplementary support in the way of group sessions, cooking classes, shopping tours, feedback, self-efficacy sessions and/or individual counselling. We aimed to use this variety in helping us to understand which dietary fat interventions are more useful, by using sub grouping (by reduced or modified fat aim, and by food provided or dietary advice for example) and meta-regression (on study duration and the difference between intervention and control arms in saturated or monounsaturated fat intake for example).</P>
<P>We addressed identifying all the relevant studies through use of a wide search strategy, that was time consuming. However, we believe that we have included most relevant trials. We also carefully defined acceptable interventions for each arm, so that decisions on inclusion were simpler, and the two independent assessors more often agreed. Data synthesis was augmented by sub-grouping and meta-regression to help us understand the effects of individual elements of dietary fat changes.</P>
<P>A study that sets out to assess the effect of a 30% reduction in saturated fat intake may attain this level of reduction in some participants, exceed it in some and not achieve it at all in others. The actual mean change attained in the intervention group may be less dramatic than that aimed for, and the participants in the control group may also reduce their saturated fat intake by a small amount, reducing the difference in saturated fat between the groups further and so reducing the scale of any outcome. This can be dealt with in the systematic review if we meta-regress the difference in saturated fat intake between the intervention and control group with the scale of the outcome (assuming a linear dose response), still allowing us to understand the effect of altering saturated fat intake. However, there is also a problem of measuring actual saturated fat intake achieved - some trials did not report this (whether because they did not assess it, or did assess it and were embarrassed by the results or simply didn't have space to report this relatively uninteresting outcome), and others did report the results of asking people what they are eating (using a food frequency questionnaire or several 24 hour food recalls). However, there is good evidence to believe that asking people how they are eating may produce somewhat biased information (<LINK REF="REF-Kristal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schatzkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schatzkin 2003</LINK>), and this may be a greater problem where the participant has been recently urged to eat in a particular way, as in a dietary trial.</P>
<P>A better solution to measuring the saturated fat intake achieved individually and as a mean in each study arm may be use of a biomarker of saturated fat intake. Our understanding of the relationship between dietary saturated fat intake and serum cholesterol has been quite clear since Hegsted's work in 1965 (<LINK REF="REF-Hegsted-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegsted 1965</LINK>). Meta-analysis by Mensink and Katan provided even more specific relationships between serum HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and changes in saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats and carbohydrate from highly controlled short term studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>). Unless long term dietary fat changes differ from these short term effects, understanding the changes in serum lipids in the trials included in this systematic review should allow us to understand the dietary fat changes. However, unfortunately few studies that experienced substantial numbers of deaths or cardiovascular events also report HDL, LDL or triglycerides (most older studies do not even report the composite serum total cholesterol). This has made it very difficult to understand whether lack of effect of dietary fat changes on total and cardiovascular mortality was due to minimal differences in fat intake between the control and intervention arms, or because such changes make no difference to mortality.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-23 17:42:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In compiling the included studies we worked hard to locate randomised studies that altered dietary fat for at least 6 months, even when cardiovascular events were not reported in study publications, or where such events were reported incidentally as reasons for participant drop outs. We attempted to contact all authors of potential studies to verify the presence, or not, of our outcomes. In many included studies no outcomes relevant to this review occurred within the participants, and the numbers of events occurring within single studies varied from none to over 2000 deaths, over 500 cardiovascular deaths, and over 3000 cardiovascular events (all within the WHI trial, the largest single study with almost 50,000 participants for many years). The addition of the WHI trial (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>), despite its size, did not alter the results substantially from the previous review, and did not introduce heterogeneity to the review.</P>
<P>The number of cardiovascular deaths was relatively small, so while we can be quite confident in reporting a reduction in cardiovascular events with dietary fat intervention (especially fat modification), and a lack of effect on total mortality, the effect on cardiovascular mortality is less clear. The relative risk of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04) may translate into a small protective effect, however this is unclear. The lack of effect on individual cardiovascular events is harder to explain - there were over 2000 myocardial infarctions, over 1000 strokes and non-fatal MI, almost 3000 cancer deaths, over 3000 diabetes diagnoses and 6000 cancer diagnoses. Lack of clear effects on any of these outcomes is surprising given the effects on total cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>The funnel plots are difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) but there is some suggestion that there may be some trials of reduced fat interventions with higher relative risks missing, and some of modified fat interventions with lower relative risks missing (there are too few studies of reduced and modified interventions to tell). If additional studies of reduced fat diets with higher relative risks were found this would not alter the lack of effect of reduced fat diets on total mortality or cardiovascular events. If further modified fat studies were found these would be unlikely to alter the lack of effect of modified fat on mortality, but may strengthen its preventive effect on cardiovascular events.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-29 18:51:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lee Hooper">
<P>All of the studies included in this review, whether they reduced or modified dietary fat, aimed to reduce saturated fat intake. Overall reduction and/or modification of dietary fat had no effect on total mortality or cardiovascular mortality but did appear to reduce cardiovascular events by 14% (although effects on myocardial infarction and stroke individually were not clear). This result was rather different from those of <LINK REF="REF-Siri_x002d_Tarino-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siri-Tarino 2010</LINK> who systematically reviewed cohort studies that assessed relationships between saturated fat and cardiovascular events. They included 21 studies and did not find statistically significant associations between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11). As with our review they found no relationship between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease (RR 1.07, 95%CI 0.96 to 1.19) or stroke (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.05).</P>
<P>In our review there was no effect of reducing total fat on total or cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events. This was also observed in a systematic review of observational studies. <LINK REF="REF-Skeaff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeaff 2009</LINK> included 28 US and European cohorts (including 6600 coronary heart disease deaths among 280000 participants) finding that total fat intake was not significantly associated with coronary heart disease mortality (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.74 to 1.18) or coronary heart events (RR 1.02, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.05). <LINK REF="REF-Skeaff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeaff 2009</LINK> also partly updated the previous version of this review, adding in the <LINK REF="STD-Finnish-Mental-Hosp-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Finnish Mental Hosp 1972</LINK> studies (excluded from both versions of this review as this was a cluster randomised study with only 2 clusters, and also because it carried out a crossover study, inappropriate in a progressive condition such as cardiovascular disease) and the Women's Health Initiative (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>), the largest of the studies published between the versions of our review. They also found that studies reducing total fat had no effect on cardiovascular mortality or events. They also observed a marginally significant relationship between P/S (polyunsaturated / saturated fat) ratio and cardiovascular events, but no relationship with cardiovascular mortality (similar to our suggestion that modifying dietary fat reduces cardiovascular events by 18%, without an important effect on total or cardiovascular mortality).</P>
<P>While we found in this review that replacing saturated with unsaturated fats appeared to be beneficial in terms of cardiovascular events, it was not clear whether replacing saturated fats by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats, either or both, was beneficial. Meta-regression did not suggest any significant relationship between either polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats and cardiovascular events in this review. A recent review by <LINK REF="REF-Mozaffarian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozaffarian 2010</LINK>, which again included very similar studies to the last version of this review, with the Finnish Mental Hospital study and Women's Health Initiative data added, stated that their findings provided evidence that consuming polyunsaturated fat in place of saturated fat would reduce coronary heart disease. However, their evidence for this was limited and circumstantial, as they found that modifying fat reduced the risk of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death (combined) by 19% (similar to our result). As the mean increase in polyunsaturated fat in these studies was 9.9% of energy they infer an effect of increasing polyunsaturated fat by 5% of energy of 10% reduction in risk of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death. They provided no suggestion or evidence of a relationship between degree of polyunsaturated fat increase and level of risk reduction.</P>
<P>Within the meta-regression we hoped to combine studies that effectively altered saturated fat by different degrees (so that studies that reduced saturated fat very little and studies that reduced it a great deal would all offer data points for the meta-regression against mortality and morbidity endpoints, and similarly for total fat, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and trans fats). Unfortunately many of the included studies did not report data on assessed dietary intake during the trial, reducing the quantity of data available to understand the relationships. Another limitation in understanding effects of individual classes of fatty acids on mortality and morbidity (in both trials and observational studies) was our ability to correctly assess participant's intake. We could overcome this by using biomarkers such as serum LDL cholesterol (differences between the LDL concentration in the intervention and control arms could be seen as a reasonable and independent approximation of saturated fat intake), however as many studies were carried out in the 1960s to 1990s few measured and reported LDL cholesterol. We tried using meta-regression with serum total cholesterol (although this is a composite marker and so less related to saturated fat intake), but although this was available for more studies that LDL it was still not available for all studies. It should be noted that the meta-regression with the smallest P value (less than 0.1) was the effect of difference in serum LDL cholesterol between intervention and control arms and cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>Pooled results of dietary fat trials indicate that reduction or modification of dietary fat intake does significantly reduce the incidence of combined cardiovascular events. The effect is consistent with a benefit as large as a 23% reduction, or as small as a 4% reduction, with a best estimate of 14% reduction in events (the first version of this review suggested an effect of 16% with slightly wider confidence intervals). This effect is seen almost exclusively in those who continue to modify their diet over at least two years. Duration of intervention does appear to be crucial. In the 4S trial (<LINK REF="REF-_x0034_S-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">4S 1994</LINK>) 4,444 participants were followed for roughly 19,339 person-years of observation, a mean of 4.35 years each. The Kaplan-Meier curve for all-cause mortality for the 4S trial only showed a clear separation between the two randomisation groups at roughly two years. For this reason trials within the systematic review were grouped in the first version of this review into those with a mean follow-up of two years or less, and those with mean follow-up of more than two years. In our meta-analysis, studies of at least two years duration reduced the risk of cardiovascular events (by 22%) while studies shorter than 2 years did not (best estimate of effect was a reduction in risk of 5%), Analysis 7.17. The trials with follow-up times from 6 months to 2 years may be diluting the effect of the trials with more than two years follow-up in the overall meta-analysis. Despite this meta-regression of study duration vs. cardiovascular events does not suggest a statically significant relationship. This may be due to confounding effect of the diet being less rigorously adhered to over longer durations, but we have no evidence of this.</P>
<P>Total mortality was examined as it is an important outcome, and there is little likelihood of ascertainment or diagnostic bias which may occur with cause-specific event outcomes. The data follow a similar trend, with no effect in the shorter trials and a suggestion of benefit in the trials of more than two years, but here the trend is not significant (the rate ratio for total mortality was 0.98 overall in the 2000 version of this review, and the relative risk is 0.98 in this version), with a relative risk of 1.05 in trials with mean follow-up of two years or less, 0.97 in trials with a mean follow-up of more than two years). This pattern suggests that the effects of dietary fat modification will take time to manifest themselves, and there is little evidence of immediate effects of fat reduction and/or modification on factors such as thrombosis. The main effects of dietary fat reduction and modification are likely to be on the scale and type of atherosclerotic plaque, but other mechanisms may be operating.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants level of risk</HEADING>
<P>As the rate of events is higher in high risk groups (by definition), it should require smaller sample sizes and shorter follow up to observe an effect of an intervention in a high risk group of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1993</LINK>). There have been suggestions that randomised controlled trials are unsuitable for assessing the effectiveness of interventions with very modest levels of effect in low risk populations, because of the huge numbers of person-years of observation needed to gain sufficient statistical power to avoid Type II errors (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1997</LINK>). However, with the publication of the Women's Health Intervention trial (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-with-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI with CVD 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-without-CVD-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI without CVD 2006</LINK>) we now have data on more cardiovascular events in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease (3408 events) than in people with moderate (143 events) or high risk (1336 events). The same is true for cardiovascular deaths (879, 23 and 505 respectively) and total mortality (3717, 47, and 528 deaths respectively). Given reasonable sized data sets for those at both high and low risk of cardiovascular disease, a similar level of risk reduction of combined cardiovascular events was seen in high and low risk groups (a 7% reduction in risk, or RR 0.93), but this effect only reaches statistical significance in the high risk participants. The reason for this is unclear.</P>
<P>When endpoints such as total mortality are used the situation becomes more difficult as in low risk groups the proportion of deaths which are unrelated to cardiovascular disease (and perhaps unlikely to be influenced by dietary fat changes) rises, again diluting any differences in the numbers of deaths between intervention and control groups. It is more likely that significant changes in cardiovascular deaths will be seen than in total mortality. The trend is certainly in this direction (pooled relative risk for total mortality 0.98, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.04, for cardiovascular mortality 0.94, 95%CI 0.85 to 1.04). Our best estimate is that dietary fat reduction and modification result in a reduction of 6% in deaths due to cardiovascular disease, and a reduction of 2% in total deaths, but the confidence intervals are wide.</P>
<P>The high risk participants in the dietary fat trials all show evidence of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Under current guidelines most high risk participants with raised lipid levels should be on lipid lowering medication (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>). This raises the question of whether there is any additional advantage of adherence to a low or modified fat diet in addition to statin therapy. Little evidence exists at present to answer this question. However, in all parts of the world where drug budgets are restricted and use of lipid lowering medication remains rationed even for those at high risk the use of modified fat diets would appear to be a cost-effective option leading to considerable reductions in cardiovascular events for populations (and so in health budgets) in only a few years.</P>
<P>Low risk participants are unlikely to be on lipid lowering medication under current guidelines. The suggestion of protection of this group from cardiovascular events, with a reduction of roughly 7% of events, by dietary fat modification (even though this does not reach statistical significance, but taking into account our best estimate) would appear to merit continued public health action.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Low fat or modified fat diets</HEADING>
<P>An individuals dietary intake is a complex mixture of foods, each of which is a complex mixture of nutrients. Altering one dietary component leads to unintentional alterations in many others, each of which may have positive or negative effects on several risk factors and, eventually, health.</P>
<P>The fat interventions included in this review were low fat diets (where total fat is reduced, and energy is usually replaced by increasing carbohydrate intake), modified fat diets (where a proportion of saturated fat is replaced by unsaturated fats, and total fat intakes do not alter) and combinations of the two (with some fat reduction and some replacement with unsaturates). Modified fat diets appear to have rather better effects on major cardiovascular risk factors than reduced fat diets in indirect comparison, but not in direct comparisons (where the numbers of studies and participants are small). The indirect comparison data fits with data from <LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>, suggesting that low fat, high carbohydrate diets are likely to result in higher triglyceride and lower HDL cholesterol levels than diets where saturated fats are wholly replaced by unsaturated fats, but direct comparisons will be important in confirming this.</P>
<P>It is important that individuals and populations are receiving clear, evidence-based advice about the types of dietary fat changes which are most effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, as well as ways to achieve those changes. Further research comparing low fat and modified fat changes on cardiovascular disease risk factors would be feasible and helpful.</P>
<P>This review suggests that modified fat intake, or modified and reduced fat intake combined (but not reduced fat intake alone) are protective against combined cardiovascular events. No clear effects of these interventions on total or cardiovascular mortality were seen.</P>

<P>Dietary change to reduce saturated fat and partly replace it with unsaturated fats appears to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, but replacing the saturated fat with carbohydrate (creating a low fat diet) was not clearly protective of cardiovascular events (despite small improvements in weight, body mass index, total and LDL cholesterol). The protective effect was seen almost exclusively in those who continue to modify their diet over at least two years, and in studies of men (not those of women). Dietary advice to those at high risk of cardiovascular disease (particularly where lipid lowering medication may not be available), and probably also to lower risk population groups, should continue to include dietary fat modification, possibly as part of a Mediterranean dietary pattern, and it should be stressed that this is a permanent pattern of eating.</P>
<P>Effects on total and cardiovascular mortality are much less clear. No evidence was found on the long term health effects of altering trans fat intake.</P>

<P>Long term research to help us understand what types of unsaturated fats are most useful in the diet when replacing saturated fats (monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and the relevant specific fatty acids) are urgently needed.</P>
<P>The financial implications (costs and savings) of appropriate advice and legislation to modify fat intake in those at various levels of cardiovascular risk should be assessed and reflected in health policy. Whilst interventions to alter dietary fat intake in individuals at high cardiovascular risk have been fairly successful, such health promotion initiatives in the general population have been less successful. Further work is needed to help high and low risk individuals to make effective changes to dietary fat and to maintain these changes over their lifetimes. Research into the effects of legislation to alter fat contents of foods, improved labelling, pricing initiatives and improved availability of healthier foods, linking food production and processing into the health agenda may yield huge advances in this area.</P>
<P>It is not clear whether there is additional benefit of modifying dietary fat in those at high risk of cardiovascular disease who are on lipid lowering medication. Further research to examine the need for maintenance of dietary fat modification whilst on lipid lowering medication would be useful, but not as useful as understanding specific dietary fat replacements for saturated fat.</P>
<P>No trials assessing the long term health implications of reducing trans fat intake were found, and most trials did not report trans fat intake in intervention and control arms, so the evidence on long term impact of trans fat alteration rests on intermediate outcomes only. Long term trials of reductions in trans fats would be helpful to clarify effects on cardiovascular health and mortality.</P>

Adding all studies within the set of subgroups together occasionally adds to fewer than the total number of studies for that outcome. The reason for this is that sometimes trials cannot be allocated to specific subgroups so have to be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

<BR/>Feedback: Dear Authors,<BR/>
<BR/>Many compliments for the enormous amount of work in putting together the evidence on reducing or modifying fat intake as a dietary change to prevent CVD. However, I am of the opinion that you overstated your conclusions and that the recommendation to change to a non-saturated fat diet is not based on sufficient evidence. My arguments are as follows. First of all you have picked one positive outcome out of a dozen of negative outcomes, in fact all other outcomes, to underpin your recommendation. You do not even discuss how come that only this one is supportive and the rest not. I believe that this does not make a strong case for a preventive effect. You do not explain why a much better defined and also plausible outcome as mortality does not show any effect whereas a quite ill-defined effect such as all cardiovascular events does show an effect. In addition, it is difficult to understand why none of the other cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions, shows an effect. I believe that this points much more strongly to no effect than to the overall positive effect that you have formulated.For a person who should decide to change diet, the figures are not very convincing either. Even though you say that this reduces the risk with 14%, in practice, this means that my CVD risk would change from 7% to 6%. Being totally healthy otherwise, it is probably even much lower than that. That is not a big incentive to start changing something important as your diet.<BR/>I believe that taking these items into account would further improve the review.<BR/>
<BR/>Best wishes<BR/>

<P>Thank you so much for your thoughts, it is great to get feedback!  </P>
<P>We don&#8217;t agree that we have over-stated our conclusions &#8211; we have stated clearly in the abstract that we found no effect on mortality or cardiovascular mortality, but that we did find a small but statistically significant effect on cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>In the abstract we quote the overall effect of reducing or modifying dietary fat on cardiovascular events, but within the review we show that the effect is only seen in longer studies, and in studies that modified fat rather than reducing it.  This means that the effect of modifying fat for at least 2 years is considerably greater than the quoted 14%, as the 14% is diluted by reduced fat studies and short studies.  The actual effect (of the subgroup of studies that were at least 2 years long and modified fat intake) was around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95, p 0.02, I2 67%, 584 events).  However, this was a subgroup analysis and so did not feature in the abstract, and if we had quoted it we would correctly have been challenged for overstating our case. </P>
<P>You worry that there is no supportive evidence of effects on individual cardiovascular events &#8211; but there were very few people who experienced myocardial infarction in the studies of modified fat (only 579, with a RR of 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16) and even fewer people with stroke (51 people, with a RR of 0.70, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.34).  It is quite feasible that reductions in both stroke and MI lead to the reduction in cardiovascular events, but that short term studies diluted the effect seen, and low numbers led to low power, obscuring any effect.  </P>
<P>It is not surprising at all that while we saw reductions in cardiovascular events we did not see similar reductions in mortality &#8211; fortunately most cardiovascular events are not fatal, and many deaths are not cardiovascular in origin, so if modifying fat intake reduces cardiovascular events the effect on cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality will be much less clear. </P>
<P>It is great to hear that your cardiovascular risk is so low &#8211; well done!  Given your risk is only 7% (or less) even a 50% risk reduction would make only a small difference to you.  However, to a person with a larger baseline risk, or for a whole population, a reduction of 14% (or 27% from a long term modified fat diet) is a great help. </P>
<P>With best wishes, Lee and the review team</P>
