<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Asthma is a common illness causing wheezing, coughing and difficulty with breathing in adults and children. Asthma is becoming increasingly common worldwide and this is especially true in higher income countries. There has been a move towards delivery of asthma care via primary care based asthma clinics in such countries. Such clinics comprise organised routine asthma care within a dedicated, regular time slot; these are usually nurse led and supported by doctors. However it is not yet known whether these clinics are effective.</P>
<P>This review aimed to explore this question and included three studies with a total of 466 participants. These studies did not find any overall difference between asthma clinic and usual clinical practice care by a general practitioner for the following outcomes: A&amp;E department visits for asthma, use of reliever or preventer medication for asthma and quality of life measures, but there was considerable uncertainty about these results. One study found that there was a reduction in nocturnal awakening due to asthma in the asthma clinic group compared to control but no difference in other symptom outcomes reported. Given the limited evidence found in this review, we believe that there is a need for further evidence in order to assess the effectiveness of asthma clinics.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Asthma is defined as the presence of variable airflow obstruction with symptoms (more than one of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough). It is becoming increasingly common worldwide and this is especially true in higher income countries. In several of these countries there has been a move towards delivery of asthma care via primary care based asthma clinics. Such clinics deliver proactive asthma care sited within primary care, via regular, dedicated sessions which are usually nurse led and doctor supported. They include organised recall of patients on an asthma register and care usually comprises education, symptom review and guideline-based management. Despite the proliferation of such clinics, especially in countries such as the United Kingdom (UK), there is a paucity of evidence to support their use. This review sets out to look at the evidence for the effectiveness of asthma clinics.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>A total of three studies involving 466 participants were included. There was no statistically significant difference between the asthma clinic group and the control group for most outcomes (primary outcomes: asthma exacerbations leading to hospitalisation or accident and emergency (A&amp;E) visit, use of reliever and preventer medication, quality of life; secondary outcomes: symptoms, time lost from work and withdrawals from the intervention or usual care). However, the confidence intervals were wide for all outcomes and there was substantial heterogeneity between the studies for both A&amp;E visits and time lost from work. One study (101 patients) looked at nocturnal awakenings due to asthma and found a statistically significant reduction in the number of patients reporting this symptom in the asthma clinic group compared to the usual care group (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.77). There were no studies looking at the secondary outcome of exacerbations requiring oral steroids.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Asthma is defined as the presence of variable airflow obstruction and symptoms (more than one of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough) (<LINK REF="REF-British-Guideline-on-the-Management-of-Asthma-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Guideline on the Management of Asthma 2008</LINK>). The global burden of asthma is significant, estimated to affect 300 million people of all ages worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>) with a prevalence which has been increasing over the past 35 years and which is higher in more economically developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>). The monetary costs of asthma are substantial, resulting from both direct medical costs via routine and urgent healthcare, and the costs of work absence. Optimal asthma management aims to control symptoms and morbidity as well as preventing exacerbations and mortality, whilst maintaining normal activity and avoiding medication-related adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>). Almost all such routine asthma management is provided by primary care.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Whilst no specific definition of an asthma clinic exists, for the purposes of this review an asthma clinic describes a pro-active system of care sited in primary care (e.g. GP clinic) which occupies a defined and often regular clinical session for the routine review of patients with asthma. Such clinics tend to be nurse led and doctor supported, with organised recall of patients on an asthma register. The content of sessions may vary but usually includes education drawing on a variety of models, symptom review and ongoing management according to prespecified guidelines. More recently, the use of written action plans and guided self-management have been advocated.</P>
<P>Asthma clinics are increasingly being used as a means to deliver routine asthma care in high income countries such as the UK, USA and Australia. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) emphasises the need for monitoring of asthma control and a multifaceted approach, including education, self-monitoring and possession of a written action plan as part of regular reviews (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>). GINA also acknowledges the differing health priorities that exist in low and middle income countries where other respiratory conditions such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia supercede asthma in terms of public health importance and where resource availability, infrastructure and cultural issues act as barriers to the delivery of routine asthma care. As a result asthma clinics to date have largely taken place in higher income settings, following the lead of dedicated chronic disease management clinics for conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.</P>
<P>Much of the move toward the use of asthma clinics stems historically from the uptake of these in the UK, where they are now almost universal. UK guidance recommends the structured and proactive review of patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-British-Guideline-on-the-Management-of-Asthma-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Guideline on the Management of Asthma 2008</LINK>) and suggests asthma clinics in primary care may be a convenient way of delivering care. In the UK these were introduced in 1990 when funding was made available for health promotion clinics. This was further endorsed by the General Medical Services Contract in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-GMS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GMS 2003</LINK>) which remunerates practices for providing proactive regular reviews for patients with asthma.</P>
<P>Despite the proliferation of primary care based asthma clinics in high income settings, there has been remarkably little published on the effectiveness of this system of care. Whilst guidance acknowledges the benefits to structured proactive review and suggests asthma clinics as a means of delivering this, it also acknowledges that there is limited evidence that asthma clinics themselves improve outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-British-Guideline-on-the-Management-of-Asthma-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Guideline on the Management of Asthma 2008</LINK>). It has been shown that self-management education improves short- and medium-term outcomes such as healthcare utilisation and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002</LINK>), however, there is a paucity of information looking at longer-term outcomes. Much of this data relates to patients with moderate and severe asthma and there remains uncertainty as to how evidence applies to relatively low risk individuals seen more commonly in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Pinnock-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinnock 2010</LINK>). "Guided self-management" (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>) where self-management education is combined with structured review has shown favourable health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002</LINK>) but it can be argued whether these results are applicable to all patients with asthma in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Fay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fay 2000</LINK>) and how much this effect is only true for the interested minority that respond to invitations to participate.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Nine out of ten patients with asthma are treated in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Asthma-UK-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asthma UK 2001</LINK>) and integrated care for patients with moderately severe asthma has been shown to be at least as effective as conventional hospital care (<LINK REF="STD-Drummond-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drummond 1994</LINK>). Whilst there is some evidence looking separately at various components of asthma review, there is little evidence focusing on the structure within which this is delivered. To date there has been one systematic review exploring this question originally published in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>), which contained one study and concluded that there was limited evidence of benefit for primary care based asthma clinics; this is an update of the same review to encompass any new available data.</P>
<P>Despite the limited evidence, asthma clinics have become almost universal in the UK and commonplace in other higher income countries. Although this may offer some pragmatic support for efficacy it also poses challenges in designing future controlled studies. It is still not known how best to manage patients with asthma in primary care: in organised asthma clinics; planned reviews within normal surgery; or opportunistically. It is likely that evidence looking at this question will have important resource and therefore, cost implications. This review sets out to gather evidence on the effectiveness of organised care via asthma clinics in primary care. This is not a review of the effectiveness of various educational processes in asthma care which have been covered in other reviews within the Cochrane Airways Group (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welsh 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Setting and populations</HEADING>
<P>Two studies took place in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>) and one in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>) were carried out in multiple practices, 8 and 11 practices respectively, whereas the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>) took place in one practice only. The studies varied in size from 101 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>) to 195 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>). All the studies recruited participants with a recorded asthma diagnosis but there were slight differences in the recruitment criteria. One study sought consent from all patients attending the practice with asthma during a three-month recruitment period (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>); another study invited all patients who had attended the practices for asthma within the previous nine months (<LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>). The remaining study recruited patients who were registered on the asthma database but had not been seen in the asthma clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>). The mean age was 26.3 years (asthma clinic) and 27.5 years (control) in <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> which included children and adults (5 to 64 years). The other two studies only included adults. In <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> (&gt; 18 years), the mean age was 46.8 years (asthma clinic) and 49.7 years (control). <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> (18 to 55 years) reported a median age of 35.0 years (asthma clinic) and 37.0 years (control). There were comparable proportions of male patients in <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> (42% asthma clinic, 45% control) and <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> (45 % asthma clinic, 48% control), however, there was baseline imbalance in gender in <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> (56% asthma clinic, 33% control).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All included studies looked at nurse led asthma clinics with varying levels of doctor participation. One intervention comprised registered nurses with extensive experience in respiratory care delivering education followed by a general practitioner (GP) consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>). In the second study, participants received assessment, education and management from one of the practice nurses who had been trained in asthma care, with doctors signing prescriptions provided they conformed to British Thoracic Society guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-British-Guideline-on-the-Management-of-Asthma-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Guideline on the Management of Asthma 2008</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>). The remaining study delivered joint care with trained respiratory nurses delivering spirometry, review and education with a GP consultation at the end of initial and follow up visits (<LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>).</P>

In this update,we identified and included two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>). The number of included studies was low and number of participants (466) also small, therefore, the data for analysis were limited. We have presented data in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>There were wide confidence intervals and no statistically significant difference between the asthma clinic group and the control group for the following outcomes: A&amp;E attendances, hospitalisations, use of reliever and preventer medication and quality of life. Of these outcomes, there was there was significant statistical heterogeneity between studies for A&amp;E attendance. One study looked at nocturnal awakenings due to asthma and found a significant reduction in patients reporting this symptom in the asthma clinic group compared with the control group. There was no statistically significant difference and wide confidence intervals between the two groups for other symptom outcomes: morning awakening and symptoms domain scores within differing quality of life instruments. Of the two studies reporting time lost from work/school, one study showed a statistically significant reduction in this outcome for the asthma clinic group compared with control, whereas the other showed no difference between the two groups. All studies reported attrition and showed no statistically significant difference in the number of patients who were lost to follow up between asthma clinic and control groups. None of the included studies reported upon the outcome of exacerbations requiring oral steroids.</P>
<P>Overall, our review demonstrated limited evidence of efficacy or harm for asthma clinics compared to usual care apart from a single study showing some evidence of symptomatic benefit (nocturnal awakening).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies for both A&amp;E attendance and time lost from work. Differences between the studies that may account for the heterogeneity include differences in outcome definitions. <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> reported time off work or school for any reason and all-cause hospitalisations and A&amp;E attendances, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> reported time off work, hospitalisations and A&amp;E attendances due to asthma. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> included children and adults (aged 5 to 65 years) within the study, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> looked at participants over 18 years. Children are more likely to have time off school than adults time off work, which may account for the higher rates of absence in <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>. Both studies excluded participants in retirement, <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> by excluding those over 64, and <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> by including only those in employment in the analyses.</P>
<P>The high attrition rate in <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> may have affected the results for quality of life and symptoms. Many participants in this study did not attend a first appointment and a significant number subsequently dropped out. This may have been because there was a pre-existing asthma clinic in the practice and the trialists had to invite people who had already refused prior invitation to the clinic previously - this means drawing participants from a pool of people who may be poor attenders. We are uncertain why this group are poor attenders and they may not therefore be representative of the general asthmatic population. The high attrition in this study means results are difficult to interpret meaningfully as we do not know what happened to the majority of the participants who enrolled in the study. Furthermore, in the other two studies there was incomplete participation in the full intervention (three asthma clinic visits over the study period). This may have led to a conservative estimation of asthma clinic efficacy although may reflect real-life attrition. The premise for asthma clinics is to optimise asthma control and education within a routine appointment so as to avert urgent care, thus reducing morbidity and cost. Asthma clinics aim to focus on asthma control in dedicated clinician time, rather than opportunistically, where other pressures may compete. However, the poor attendance of asthma clinics may represent issues with feasibility of the intervention as patients may often be asymptomatic and, therefore, may be unwilling to take up appointments when they feel well. There may also be added inconvenience through holding a regular fixed asthma clinic which may not allow as much patient flexibility as when booking routine appointments.</P>
<P>Only one study <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> looked at two of this review's primary outcomes: use of reliever and preventer medication, however, it dichotomised this outcome into "at least weekly" and "less frequently/ never". Whilst this allowed there to be sufficient numbers of participants in each group for analysis, it means the data are less meaningful to interpret. Use of reliever medication at least weekly does not necessarily signify poor control, but will include those with very poor control (e.g. several times daily) in the same category as those with adequate control (e.g. only once a week). Likewise, use of preventer medication at least weekly may represent patients with poor compliance (e.g. only once a week) along with those that use their preventers regularly (e.g. twice daily) as prescribed.</P>
<P>A further limitation of the included studies relates to their length, with studies varying from four to six months in intervention duration. It is difficult to know whether this is a sufficient length of time to observe effect, especially for outcomes where events are rare. Furthermore, as asthma symptoms are affected by seasonal variation in climate and environment, it may be more representative for study periods to run for at least a full year to take account of this. Where event rates are low, larger, as well as longer studies may be able to show whether effects are significant.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>) were set in Australia and <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> was set in the UK. These are both counties which have a significant and growing asthma prevalence. It is known that the rate of asthma increases as communities adopt western lifestyles and become urbanised (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1998</LINK>) and asthma clinics tend to be more concentrated in Western, predominantly high income settings. With the projected increase in the world's urban populations, the burden of asthma is expected to grow. Whilst there is growing recognition of the significant burden of asthma worldwide, it is debatable as to how well methods of asthma care developed in high income settings will transfer to lower income settings. Geography, infrastructure, culture, education and resources will all pose significant barriers to delivery of asthma clinics in alternative settings. Furthermore, asthma care may be seen as a lesser public health priority where other respiratory illnesses e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis, take precedence.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> were of good methodological quality, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> was a "pragmatic" study. This latter study was sited within an existing asthma clinic rather than starting a clinic de novo, hence there were inherent limits in methodology. Participants recruited to the study were adult patients who had not already attended the practice's existing asthma clinic, therefore, may have been previously invited and not attended for unknown reasons, hence these patients may not be representative of the general asthmatic population. Due to the nature of the asthma clinic intervention it was not possible to blind participants or personnel, however, it is not clear that all attempts were made in the studies to conceal allocation of either practice or patient to the intervention or control arm, as this was not adequately described.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kernick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kernick 2002</LINK> were randomised by patient and <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK> randomised by practice which may have created differences between the studies. As <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK> was randomised within the practice, clinicians saw both clinic and control patients, unblinded to their allocation. This may have led to contamination of clinical practice across groups where clinicians having been trained up to deliver asthma care as part of the clinic may also have treated patients with asthma presenting in routine care in a similar way. In <LINK REF="STD-Heard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 1999</LINK>, we used raw data in analysis as we were unable to use calculated odds ratios adjusted for clustering by GP. In <LINK REF="STD-Pilotto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pilotto 2004</LINK>, we were able to use data where clustering for practice had been adjusted for in our analysis. This gave us greater confidence that any difference in the results between the asthma clinic and control groups was not attributable to practice differences. For example, practice differences in A&amp;E attendances may relate to practice processes and practice location (e.g. proximity to secondary care).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-12-19 18:32:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As there was no prior accepted definition of an asthma clinic a pragmatic definition was used for the purposes of this review which is open to criticism. Furthermore, despite attempts to apply a systematic process in selecting studies for inclusion or exclusion, the final decisions are subject to a level of interpretation. We attempted to minimise clinical heterogeneity by excluding trials where the asthma clinic was part of a more complex intervention (e.g. peer leader education alongside an asthma clinic) and where the intervention did not clearly fulfil important aspects of our definition, e.g. dedicated, regular time slot (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>)</P>
<P>The issue of large and/or uneven attrition, as mentioned above, will, even if addressed, possibly introduce bias as there is uncertainty as to how to handle participants for whom no data are available.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We have found no previous reviews addressing the efficacy of asthma clinics but there have been other randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at interventions where proactive, routine asthma care have taken place although not sited within a dedicated asthma clinic. <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2003</LINK> (174 participants) looked at proactive asthma care in childhood whereby a "3+plan" was instituted for participating families. This comprised three or more visits with prespecified content and active recall of patients to optimise attendance. The authors found a non-statistically significant reduction in emergency department attendance rates in the intervention group compared with control (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 1.04) and no statistically significant differences in number of days absent from school or symptom-free day scores. <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2005</LINK> (270 general practitioners and 771 admissions for asthma) evaluated the effect of implementing an asthma clinical pathway for children in general practice where intervention clinicians received training on the protocol-based management of acute and recurrent asthma. The authors found reduced hospital admissions in the intervention group but no evidence of lower morbidity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lozano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 2004</LINK> (638 children) assessed a complex intervention including peer leader education as well as organised care, and found reductions in annual symptom days. We cannot comment on which part of this complex intervention was responsible for observed improvements. Another study focusing on primary care based asthma clinics employed a pre and post experimental study design (<LINK REF="STD-Cave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cave 2001</LINK>, 129 participants). This found a significant fall in the time lost from work/school and nocturnal awakening as well as a significant reduction in the use of oral steroids and rescue bronchodilator use. The design, however, was not randomised and therefore, subject to selection bias. A further Swedish cross-sectional survey (<LINK REF="REF-Lisspers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lisspers 2010</LINK>) compared outcomes for practices with asthma clinics to those without (1477 participants) and found that although the asthma clinic patients had improved knowledge, there was no difference in asthma control and quality of life. Overall, there have been few studies, they have shown inconsistent results when evaluating organised care and it is difficult to tease out the many factors (structural, clinical, educational) factors leading to any observed benefit.</P>
<P>A systematic review has shown that despite comparable asthma frequency between ethnic groups, South Asian and black people had a higher risk of admission for asthma than white people (<LINK REF="REF-Netuveli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Netuveli 2005</LINK>). The aetiology of this effect is unknown, whether this is due to ethnic variations in asthma severity, or whether language or culture impact on health-seeking behaviour and access to healthcare. Certainly further research will need to examine delivery of asthma care with particular attention to these factors.</P>
<P>Few studies have explored reasons for poor attendance at asthma clinics, however <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995</LINK> looked at patients' views of asthma clinics. They reported that patients did not regard attendance at practice-based asthma clinics as being of potential benefit to them, with many reporting that "their" asthma was not deemed to be the variety that "kills". This issue, therefore, needs to be addressed in future research through further exploration of patients' views and reasons for non-attendance as well as looking at more convenient forms of asthma care e.g. telephone or internet-based review, which may increase patient participation.</P>
<P>There have been various computations of organised routine asthma care, some focusing on delivery e.g. via nurse, doctor, pharmacist and lay person, or route e.g. face-to-face, telephone and web-based. These may be explored in other reviews but were felt too heterogenous to fall under the remit of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>There is no conclusive evidence in this review to support or refute primary care based clinics for asthma in terms of exacerbations, symptoms and quality of life, because the evidence was limited by the small number of included studies and number of participants in them. There was also statistical heterogeneity between the studies for some of the outcomes.</P>
<P>The underpinning hypothesis in support of asthma clinics is that routine care, including education and clinical review, leads to better controlled asthma and reduced urgent care need. However, there is cost to consider in delivering asthma clinics as well as the feasibility of such clinics to patients themselves. On balance, it is unclear as to whether asthma clinics are effective, and whilst they do not appear harmful, whether they are cost effective and acceptable.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-20 15:42:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Going forward it will be less feasible to conduct further controlled studies in countries such as the UK and Australia where asthma clinics are already widespread. With the growing burden of asthma worldwide, however, it will be important to explore the delivery of asthma care whether via dedicated asthma clinics or alternative models in different income and cultural settings.</P>
<P>Moreover, further research to tease out the relative effects of structure and content of asthma clinic reviews would bring clarity, as well as further exploration as to the acceptability of such clinics to patients.</P>
