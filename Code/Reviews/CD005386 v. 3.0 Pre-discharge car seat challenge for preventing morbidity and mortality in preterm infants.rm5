<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:07:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that undertaking a pre-discharge "car seat challenge" benefits preterm infants. The "car seat challenge" assesses whether preterm infants who are ready for discharge home are prone to episodes of apnoea (stopping breathing), bradycardia (slow heart rate), or desaturation (low oxygen levels) when seated in their car seat. However, it is not clear whether the level of oxygen desaturation, apnoea, or bradycardia detected in the car seat challenge is actually harmful for preterm infants. Additionally there is concern that the use of the car seat challenge may cause undue parental anxiety about the safety of transporting their infant in a car seat. Despite these uncertainties, and despite the widespread use of the test, we have not identified any randomised controlled trials that assessed whether undertaking a car seat challenge is beneficial or harmful to preterm infants.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Physiological monitoring studies indicate that some preterm infants experience episodes of oxygen desaturation, apnoea, or bradycardia when seated in standard car safety seats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all preterm infants should be assessed for cardiorespiratory stability in their car seat prior to discharge - the "car seat challenge". We aimed to assess the evidence to support this practice, specifically to determine whether the use of the car seat challenge prevents morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials that pre-discharge cardiorespiratory monitoring in a car safety seat prevents morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - September 2005), EMBASE (1980 - September 2005), CINAHL (1982 - September 2005), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared pre-discharge cardiorespiratory monitoring in a car seat versus no monitoring in preterm infants in the week prior to planned discharge from hospital.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We did not find any randomised controlled trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It is unclear whether undertaking a pre-discharge car seat challenge is beneficial or harmful to preterm infants. Further studies are needed to determine whether the car seat challenge accurately predicts the risk of clinically significant adverse events in preterm infants travelling in car seats. If this is shown to be the case then a large randomised controlled trial is needed to provide an unbiased assessment of its utility in pre-discharge assessment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:07:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following hospital discharge, the recommended mode of carriage for neonates and young infants travelling by car is in the semi-upright position in a rear-facing safety seat with a three- or five-point harness (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1999</LINK>). Infants who are involved in collisions as car passengers are less likely to die or be seriously injured if they are restrained in a car seat appropriate for their size (<LINK REF="REF-Scherz-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherz 1976</LINK>). However, standard car safety seats are designed for the "average" term newborn infant. Preterm infants are usually discharged from hospital when they reach a post-conceptional age of about 35 to 37 weeks, typically weighing less than 2.5 kilograms (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). Some infants have a degree of respiratory and neurological immaturity at discharge. A minority has more significant problems; for example, chronic lung disease needing supplemental oxygen therapy. Careful attention to correct positioning in the car seat is essential to provide smaller infants with optimal restraint and protection from impact.</P>
<P>There is also concern that preterm infants may be prone to cardiorespiratory compromise when carried in car seats that are intended for larger term infants. Observational studies undertaken in the United States in the 1980s first highlighted the problems that preterm infants may face when using standard infant car safety seats. Bull and Stroup found that a range of standard car safety seats provided sub-optimal postural support for infants weighing about two kilograms because the strap distances from the seat bottom to the lowest shoulder strap and seat back to crotch strap were too long (<LINK REF="REF-Bull-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bull 1985</LINK>). Willett and colleagues hypothesised that the tendency for infants carried in these seats to slouch would compromise respiration. In physiological monitoring studies, these investigators found that 30% to 60% of preterm infants who were otherwise ready for hospital discharge (average weight 2.3 kilograms) had frequent episodes of hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than 85%) during a 90 minutes observation period (<LINK REF="REF-Willett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1989</LINK>). The incidence of hypoxia was inversely related to birth weight and gestational age at birth. Preterm infants who had a previous history of apnoea were more prone to have episodes of apnoea and bradycardia. Randomly selected term infants (average weight 3.4 kilograms) did not become hypoxic or bradycardic during the same test period.</P>
<P>Largely because for these findings, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended in 1991 (updated 1996, 1999) that preterm infants should be observed and monitored for apnoea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation in their car safety seat before hospital discharge - the "car seat challenge" (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1999</LINK>). The guidelines advised that infants who experienced episodes of apnoea for more than 20 seconds, bradycardia (less than 80 beats per minute) or oxygen desaturation (less than 90%) should not travel in the car safety seat. In the United States the car-seat challenge is recommended not only for those preterm infants who have had respiratory problems, but also for infants born "near-term" at 35 to 36 weeks' gestation. Most of these infants are likely to have had no respiratory problems. In support of this very broad inclusion criterion, Merchant and colleagues have reported that about one quarter of "near-term" infants did not fit securely into standard car safety seats. One in eight healthy "near-term" infants had apnoeic or bradycardic events in their car seats (<LINK REF="REF-Merchant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merchant 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most neonatal units in North America have incorporated car seat challenges into their routine discharge assessment for preterm infants. In other countries, for example in Europe, use of pre-discharge car seat challenge in standard clinical practice is less established. Even in the United States, however, there is wide variation between units in the way that the test is used. Neonatal units differ in their indications for testing, the duration of observation and monitoring, and the criteria for "passing" the test (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2005</LINK>). Evidence exists that neonatal unit-to-unit variation in the timing of hospital discharge for healthy preterm infants may be partly explained by differences in criteria for determining cardiorespiratory stability while in a car seat (<LINK REF="REF-Eichenwald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichenwald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merritt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merritt 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also variation in the recommended course of action for infants who "fail" the car seat challenge (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). The alternatives include:<BR/>1. Delaying hospital discharge and re-testing the infant at a later date.<BR/>2. Modifying the seat with blanket rolls or inserts to provide sufficient postural support for the infant to pass the test.<BR/>3. Positioning the car safety seat at about 30 degrees rather than 45 degrees to reduce slouching and respiratory obstruction. It is not clear whether this position provides optimal restraint in the event of a collision.<BR/>4. Transporting the infant in a fully supine or prone position in a carry cot with restraint straps. However, standard carry cots are not designed to withstand the forces generated in a collision. Recumbent car beds and seats that are as effective as conventional car seats in limiting collision impact have been developed recently, but availability and cost has limited their use.<BR/>5. Giving the infant a respiratory stimulant such as theophylline.</P>
<P>The car seat challenge has been introduced on the assumption that the test will identify infants who are at risk of avoidable adverse events while in a car safety seat. However, there is little evidence that the degree and duration of episodes of desaturation, bradycardia, or apnoea that are seen in preterm infants who "fail" the car seat challenge are of clinical importance. Preterm infants who are otherwise ready for discharge commonly have self-limiting episodes of obstructive apnoea when not in car seats (often related to feeding) but the existing data indicate that the severity of these episodes is not related to the risk of acute life threatening events in early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cote-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cote 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eichenwald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichenwald 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In common with other screening procedures, it is necessary to consider the effect of using the car seat challenge on all of the infants and families who are tested. Informing parents that their infant has evidence of cardiorespiratory instability during the car seat challenge may increase parental concern about their infant's general health. Even for those infants who "pass" the car seat challenge, but still have some episodes of desaturation or bradycardia while in the car seat, parents may not be fully reassured that their child is not at risk of adverse events in the car seat. It is possible, on the basis of a car seat challenge result, that parents may opt to carry their infants in their or other passengers' arms rather than in a car seat. It may also be important to consider whether the use of the car seat challenge in discharge assessments of all preterm infants has cost implications for health services. Undertaking cardiorespiratory monitoring for all preterm infants will occupy a substantial proportion of nursing time. Delaying hospital discharge for the infants who "fail" the test could have major effects on cot occupancy and availability in neonatal units. This may have consequences on intensive care availability resulting in more inter-hospital or inter-region transfers of preterm or unwell infants.</P>

<B>Primary:</B>
<BR/>1. All-cause mortality from randomisation until 12 months post-term.<BR/>2. All cases of death while in a car from randomisation until 12 months post-term.<BR/>3. All cases of "acute life-threatening events" while in a car (acute cardiorespiratory or neurological compromise that necessitates cardiorespiratory resuscitation (efforts to clear airway, promote pulmonary air entry, or support cardiac output)) from randomisation until 12 months post-term.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:07:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group including electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - September 2005), EMBASE (1980 - September 2005), and CINAHL (1982 - September 2005). The search strategy used the following text words and MeSH terms: Infant, Newborn OR Infant, Premature OR Infant, Low Birth Weight, OR Premature Birth, OR preterm OR low birth weight OR LBW OR premature; AND Patient Discharge OR Infant Equipment/ OR car seat OR safety seat. We limited the search outputs with the relevant filters for clinical trials. We did not apply any language restriction.</P>
<P>We undertook Science Citation Index "forward searches" for the physiological monitoring studies that first highlighted concerns about the cardiorespiratory stability of preterm infants in standard car safety seats (<LINK REF="REF-Bull-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bull 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1989</LINK>), and of the AAP publications that recommended use of the car seat challenge in pre-discharge assessments (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1999</LINK>).</P>

Elizabeth Pilley (EP) and William McGuire (WM) re-assessed independently the full text of these reports and excluded those studies that did not meet all of the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>2. If eligible trials were found, EP and WM planned to use the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess independently the methodological quality of these trials in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents or carers and assessors to intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. </P>
<P>3. EP and WM planned to extract any relevant information and data from each included study independently.</P>
<P>4. We planned to present outcomes for categorical data as relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to treat, with respective 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we planned to use the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval. </P>
<P>5. We planned to estimate the treatment effects of individual trials and examine heterogeneity between trial results by inspecting the forest plots and quantify the impact of heterogeneity in any meta-analysis using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (I- squared statistic). If we detected any statistical heterogeneity, we planned to explore the possible causes (for example, differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, or outcome assessments) using post hoc sub group analyses. We planned to use a fixed effects model for meta-analyses. </P>
<P>6. Cluster or group trials: We planned to use the inverse variance method to analyse the effect estimate from each individual cluster randomised trial for entry into meta-analyses (Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook). We planned to seek professional statistical advice to ensure that the trial was correctly analysed (for example, the cluster was the unit of analysis). We did not plan to undertake combined meta-analyses of cluster and non-cluster trials.</P>

<P>We did not find any randomised controlled trials that assessed the diagnostic utility of the car seat challenge in discharge assessment of preterm infants. Although it is plausible that pre-discharge cardiorespiratory monitoring might identify preterm infants who are prone to cardiorespiratory compromise while seated in a standard car seat, there are not yet any data to indicate whether the use of the test prevents mortality and morbidity. In deciding whether to use the car seat challenge in discharge assessment, it should be acknowledged that apparent cardiorespiratory abnormalities in infants born preterm, are common at the time of hospital discharge and that there are no monitoring criteria that predict an increased risk of sudden and unexpected death in infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Southall-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southall 1982</LINK>). Staff in neonatal units and parents of preterm infants who are planning to use the test in discharge planning should also consider whether there are possible adverse consequences of the use of the car seat challenge in hospital discharge assessments.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>It is unclear whether undertaking a car seat challenge is beneficial or indeed whether it causes harm. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Test validity and diagnostic accuracy: The degree to which the car seat challenge accurately predicts whether an infant will experience clinically important adverse events in a car seat after hospital discharge is not yet established. A study of diagnostic accuracy of this test may, however, be very difficult to undertake. This would require follow up of a large cohort of preterm infants, all of whom have a car seat challenge the findings of which are not known to any parents, carers, and clinicians. Applying the criterion standard would need a method of ascertaining all "clinically important" events (death, acute life-threatening events) for several months following hospital discharge. As a preliminary to such a study (if this was considered appropriate and feasible), it may be possible to determine in a population-based study, how commonly preterm infants experience serious adverse events in car safety seats. </P>
<P>2. Test clinical utility: The least biased assessment of whether the use of the car seat challenge prevents mortality or morbidity (including long term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes), or causes harm would require a very large randomised controlled trial. It may be useful to determine whether such a trial would be supported by parents and carers. As well as determining the effect of the test on mortality, development and growth, it is important to assess parental satisfaction and health service costs. Qualitative research exploring parental perceptions and concerns might help to determine whether the car seat challenge alleviates or increases parental anxiety and may aid in identifying potential consequences of this.</P>
