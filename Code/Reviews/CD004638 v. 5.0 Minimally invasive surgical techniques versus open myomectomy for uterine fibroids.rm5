<P>
<B>Review question: </B>In this Cochrane review, we compared surgical results after myomectomy by open surgery versus myomectomy by laparoscopy and hysteroscopy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Fibroids are common benign tumours arising in the uterus. Sometimes they cause problems such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain and difficulty passing urine and bowel motions. Fibroids can be removed by an operation called myomectomy, which is performed traditionally by cutting into the abdomen (laparotomy). In this procedure, the fibroid is removed and the uterus is conserved. Myomectomy can also be performed by using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy and hysteroscopy). Laparoscopic myomectomy involves small cuts in the abdomen (three or four, about 1 cm long) followed by removal of the fibroid using a telescopic rod lens system and long laparoscopic instruments. The fibroids are then taken out by a procedure called <I>morcellation</I>, in which they are shaved into smaller pieces. Hysteroscopy is useful for fibroids, which are mostly inside the cavity of the uterus, and does not require any cut to the abdomen .</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>Nine studies including 808 premenopausal women with uterine fibroids compared various methods of myomectomy. These studies were conducted in Italy (seven studies), Austria and China. The evidence is current to July 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>Myomectomy by laparoscopy is a less painful procedure compared with open surgery. Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be.' Results show that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the mean pain score at six hours (mean difference (MD) -2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.88 to -1.92) and at 48 hours (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00) would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. Results of our analysis regarding pain score at 24 hours were uncertain (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.12). Risk of fever after the operation was reduced by 50% in women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77). Drop in haemoglobin level (indicating reduced blood loss) could not be compared because results of the analysis were not conclusive because of differences in results with even the same surgical techniques. Risk of injury to intestines and other organs could not be determined in this meta-analysis. No evidence was found of increased risk of recurrence of fibroids after laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.99).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Some outcomes involved small numbers of participants, poor information about blinding in included studies and very wide confidence intervals.</P>

<P>Fibroids are common benign tumours arising in the uterus. Myomectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for women with symptomatic fibroids who prefer or want uterine conservation.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-22 23:42:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (inception to July 2014), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (inception to July 2014), MEDLINE(R) (inception to July 2014), EMBASE (inception to July 2014), PsycINFO (inception to July 2014) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (inception to July 2014) to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched trial registers and references from selected relevant trials and review articles. We applied no language restriction in these searches.</P>

<P>All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing myomectomy via laparotomy, mini-laparotomy or laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy versus laparoscopy or hysteroscopy in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids diagnosed by clinical and ultrasound examination were included in the meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-22 23:42:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted study selection and extracted data in duplicate. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain, reported in six studies, and in-hospital adverse events, reported in eight studies. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, reported in four studies, operating time, reported in eight studies and recurrence of fibroids, reported in three studies. Each of the other secondary outcomes&#8212;improvement in menstrual symptoms, change in quality of life, repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later date&#8212;was reported in a single study. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and data combined using the fixed-effect model. The quality of evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-22 23:46:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 23 potentially relevant trials, of which nine were eligible for inclusion in this review. The nine trials included in our meta-analysis had a total of 808 women. The overall risk of bias of included studies was low, as most studies properly reported their methods.</P>
<P>Postoperative pain: Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be.' Postoperative pain was significantly less, as determined by subjectively assessed pain score at six hours (MD -2.40, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.92, one study, 148 women, moderate-quality evidence) and 48 hours postoperatively (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00, two studies, 80 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with the open myomectomy group. This means that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, mean pain score at six hours and 48 hours would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. No significant difference in postoperative pain score was noted between the laparoscopic and open myomectomy groups at 24 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.12, four studies, 232 women, I² = 43%, moderate-quality evidence). The overall quality of these findings is moderate; therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>In-hospital adverse events: No evidence suggested a difference in unscheduled return to theatre (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86, two studies, 188 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) and laparoconversion (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.83, eight studies, 756 women, I² = 53%, moderate-quality evidence) when open myomectomy was compared with laparoscopic myomectomy. Only one study including 148 women reported injury to pelvic organs (no events were described in other studies), and no significant difference was noted between laparoscopic myomectomy and laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy myomectomy (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86). Significantly lower risk of postoperative fever was observed in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with groups treated with all types of open myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77, I² = 0%, six studies, 635 women). This indicates that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the risk of postoperative fever is 50% lower than among those treated with open surgery. No studies reported immediate hysterectomy, uterine rupture, thromboembolism or mortality. Six studies including 549 women reported haemoglobin drop, but these studies were not pooled because of extreme heterogeneity (I² = 97%) and therefore could not be included in the analysis.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-16 22:50:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Laparoscopic myomectomy is a procedure associated with less subjectively reported postoperative pain, lower postoperative fever and shorter hospital stay compared with all types of open myomectomy. No evidence suggested a difference in recurrence risk between laparoscopic and open myomectomy. More studies are needed to assess rates of uterine rupture, occurrence of thromboembolism, need for repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later stage.</P>

<P>Fibroids (leiomyomas or myomas) are benign tumours that arise from individual smooth muscle cells. Fibroids can form wherever there is smooth muscle, but they are usually found in the uterus and constitute the most common benign tumours among women. They are found clinically in 25% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1981</LINK>). However, their true prevalence is higher, given that a large number of fibroids do not cause symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Okolo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okolo 2008</LINK>); <LINK REF="REF-Cramer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramer 1990</LINK> found myomas in 77% of hysterectomy specimens. The prevalence of fibroids during reproductive age varies with different methods of diagnosis and is estimated to be between 5.4% and 77% (<LINK REF="REF-Drinville-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drinville 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2002</LINK>). It is known that prevalence rates vary amongst racial groups, with a lifetime risk of 70% for white women and greater than 80% for black women (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of fibroids is not fully understood. Factors that have been implicated include ovarian steroid hormones (oestrogen and progesterone), genetic predisposition (e.g. the genes <I>HMGIC</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Mine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 2001</LINK>) and <I>MED12</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Makinen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makinen 2011</LINK>)), growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) (<LINK REF="REF-Gentry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentry 2000</LINK>) and transforming growth factor (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>)) and up-regulation of type I and type III collagen and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (<LINK REF="REF-Senturk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senturk 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although fibroids are asymptomatic in most women, they are symptomatic in others. Symptoms commonly associated with fibroids include heavy uterine bleeding, pressure-related symptoms (e.g. on the bladder) and infertility; they can cause severe pain and complications in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Bajekal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajekal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallach 2004</LINK>). Uterine fibroids also have a significant negative impact on quality of life and work productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Downes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downes 2010</LINK>). Few data are available on the non-medical or outpatient costs associated with symptomatic fibroids; however, the estimated average inpatient cost of uterine fibroid treatment in the USA in 2004 was USD 15,405 (<LINK REF="REF-Viswanathan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viswanathan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of symptomatic fibroids has traditionally been surgical; however medical therapies have been tried, and, more recently, uterine artery embolisation was developed as an alternative to surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravina-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravina 1995</LINK>). Medical therapy with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) appears useful in the short term, but side effects limit their long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Golan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2001</LINK>). Both mifepristone (a progesterone antagonist) and asoprisnil (a selective progesterone receptor modulator) are promising, but neither has shown long-term efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for women with large or symptomatic fibroids. In the USA, one-third of all hysterectomies are performed as the result of uterine fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Merill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merill 2008</LINK>). Myomectomy&#8212;surgical removal of fibroids with conservation of the uterus&#8212;may be the preferred option for several reasons, including retention of fertility.</P>
<P>The site, size and number of fibroids determine the surgical route employed. Although intracavitary fibroids can be removed hysteroscopically, intramural and subserosal fibroids are most commonly removed through the abdominal wall by myomectomy. Open myomectomy (laparotomy), once popularised by Victor Bonney (<LINK REF="REF-Bonney-1931" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonney 1931</LINK>), involves surgical removal of the fibroids through an incision in the abdominal wall, closure of the resulting uterine dead space and reconstitution of the remaining uterus. Decisions about choosing to proceed with myomectomy vary between gynaecologists, which may reflect the skill of the surgeon or differences among the women treated.</P>
<P>Open myomectomy is associated with blood loss both during the operation and afterwards. Some case series have reported transfusion rates of up to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-LaMorte-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaMorte 1993</LINK>), and approximately 1% of women who undergo a myomectomy may require hysterectomy during surgery or in the first 24 hours after surgery because of uncontrollable bleeding.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-22 23:54:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Myomectomy is the traditional primary choice amongst surgical options for the removal of symptomatic fibroids that cannot be removed hysteroscopically among women who wish to remain fertile. Since 1979, various minimal access surgical techniques have been developed as alternatives to open myomectomy (
<LINK REF="REF-Semm-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semm 1979</LINK>
). These include hysteroscopic or laparoscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic myolysis (in situ destruction of the fibroid through diathermy or laser) and laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy. For the purposes of this review, we have included both laparoscopic and hysteroscopic myomectomy; however we are including laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy and mini-laparotomy in the open myomectomy category, as these procedures involve dissection of the fibroid through a 5-cm incision in the abdomen. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the removal of fibroids via a diathermy incision of the uterus, often assisted by morcellation, with small keyhole incisions in the abdominal wall through which instruments under telescopic control are passed (<LINK REF="REF-Semm-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semm 1979</LINK>). Hysteroscopic resection of fibroids (or myomectomy) is the preferred method when fibroids are submucosal, or when most of an intramural fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity. This technique involves removal of fibroids through the cervix and is generally limited to fibroids smaller than 4 cm in diameter amongst women seeking fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Pritts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritts 2009</LINK>). Laparoscopic myomectomy differs from open myomectomy, in which a large (approximately 12-cm) transverse incision is made along the abdomen, the fibroid excised, large sutures tied and abdominal layers closed (usually a minimum of rectus sheath and skin layers).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-22 23:55:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale of endoscopic techniques is that when a surgical incision is smaller, it causes less of an insult to the abdominal wall; therefore the woman will recover and will be pain free and mobilise more quickly after surgery. The overall aim is to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality. Better visualisation of deep pelvic structures and increased accuracy of surgery may lessen the blood loss associated with myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2009</LINK>). Other indications suggest that smaller incisions and less tissue damage may lead to reduced postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2009</LINK>). Postoperative pain is usually measured by the standardised measurement instrument called a visual analogue scale (VAS), with which patients rate their pain using numbers from zero to 10, with zero indicating complete freedom from pain and 10 representing the worst pain one can imagine. However, it should be remembered that although the incisions may be minor, this is still major surgery. In addition, minimal access techniques may be associated with complications that are not associated with open surgery, for example, visceral injury at trocar insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Querleu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querleu 1993</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-22 13:52:13 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the past 20 years, gynaecological surgery has progressed to include minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic myomectomy. Evidence suggests that laparoscopic myomectomy is associated with reduced morbidity compared with open myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Dubuisson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubuisson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2009</LINK>); some studies have reported reduced blood loss, better recovery and a shorter hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Frishman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frishman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2009</LINK>). These studies have also reported comparable rates of pregnancy, fibroid recurrence and operative complications when the two surgical methods were compared. However, the evidence presented in these studies is limited by the rather small numbers of study participants. Another point of concern with endoscopic surgery is the potential for uterine rupture; however the level of risk is currently unclear. Several case reports have described uterine rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Dubuisson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubuisson 2000</LINK>); one review suggested that rupture is less frequent following laparoscopic myomectomy compared with the open approach (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2000</LINK>). A systematic review examining all relevant outcomes among a larger number of women is needed to enable women and their surgeons to make informed choices about which route of surgery is best.</P>

<P>Dichotomous data were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and were combined for meta-analysis using Review Manager (RevMan) software. Increased odds of a particular outcome are displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line, and decreased odds of an outcome are displayed graphically to the left of the centre-line. Continuous data were combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. If only medians and ranges were given, a descriptive analysis was undertaken. We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We will treat ordinal data (e.g. quality of life scores) as continuous data. We will present 95% CIs for all outcomes. When data needed to calculate ORs or MDs are not available, we will utilise the most detailed available numerical data, which may facilitate similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values). We will compare the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies versus how they are presented in the review, while taking account of legitimate differences.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laparoscopic myomectomy versus open myomectomy</HEADING>
<P>Laparoscopic myomectomy is a less painful procedure compared with all types of open myomectomy, as indicated by lower pain VAS scores at six hours and at 48 hours. However, no evidence of a difference in pain scores was noted on the VAS at 24 hours after surgery between laparoscopic myomectomy and all types of open myomectomy. Moderate heterogeneity (43%) for this comparison could be explained by the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK>, which included laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy myomectomy, in which laparoscopy is used for fibroid enucleation and dissection, and specimen removal and suturing are done through a small abdominal incision. This might reduce tissue damage and operating time compared with open myomectomy and may skew the results of pain scores. The overall level of evidence for postoperative pain is moderate, which means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The sensitivity analysis that we performed showed that results for postoperative pain are stable when a random-effects model was used, or when the summary effect was measured by risk ratio rather than odds ratio.</P>
<P>Risk of visceral injury and unscheduled return to theatre could not be estimated because of their low incidence in the included studies. No evidence suggested a difference in the need for laparoconversion between laparoscopic myomectomy and all types of open myomectomy. However, the incidence of laparoconversion is low, and the number of women included in the trials was not sufficient to result in a stable conclusion. Furthermore, heterogeneity for this outcome is mild, which can be explained by the different operating techniques used for open myomectomy. Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2007</LINK> showed an unusually high incidence of laparoconversion in the open myomectomy group, and the study had a high impact on the overall results of this outcome. Therefore, larger studies are needed before a definitive answer can be provided regarding perioperative in-hospital adverse events.</P>
<P>Results of our analysis have shown that postoperative febrile morbidity is less common in laparoscopic myomectomy than in all types of open myomectomy. The power of the evidence for these results seems to be moderate, indicating that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). No heterogeneity was noted for this outcome (I² = 0%).</P>
<P>When laparoscopic myomectomy was compared with open myomectomy, a reduced haemoglobin drop was noted postoperatively, indicating decreased intraoperative blood loss in laparoscopic myomectomy. However, heterogeneity was substantial (I² = 97%) in our analysis, which can be explained by different surgical techniques, different surgery protocols, different operating room settings or different skilled surgeons.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane review has shown that many women choose minimally invasive surgery because of benefits such as shorter postoperative recovery time and reduced risk of infection for laparoscopic hysterectomy or myomectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Nieboer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieboer 2009</LINK>). However, an important aspect of safety associated with laparoscopic hysterectomy or myomectomy is discussed in the recently published Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication about laparoscopic uterine power morcellation in hysterectomy and myomectomy. Authors of this report state that the prevalence of unsuspected uterine sarcoma among patients undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy for presumed benign leiomyoma is one in 352, and the prevalence of unsuspected uterine leiomyosarcoma is one in 498. Therefore the FDA concludes that when "using power morcellation in women with unsuspected uterine sarcoma, there would be a risk that the procedure will spread the cancerous tissue within the abdomen and pelvis, significantly worsening the patient's likelihood of long-term survival. For this reason, and because there is no reliable method for predicting whether a woman with fibroids may have a uterine sarcoma, the FDA discourages the use of laparoscopic power morcellation during hysterectomy or myomectomy for uterine fibroids" (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2014</LINK>). Nevertheless, more specific studies and a detailed analysis are needed before an evidence-based decision can be made about whether morcellation should be used and which patient characteristics might increase or lower the risk of spread of a malignant type of cancer.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-23 00:19:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled clinical trials comparing laparoscopic versus open myomectomy for uterine fibroids are included in this review. Our primary outcomes&#8212;postoperative pain and perioperative and postoperative morbidity&#8212;were reported in included trials. Because of insufficient data, we could not conduct the subgroup analyses planned in our protocol. Another limitation of our analysis is that unfortunately no trials reported on uterine rupture; therefore our analysis includes no results on this outcome.</P>
<P>All included trials treated participants with myomas measuring no larger than 10 cm. For this reason, trials do not provide outcome data for women with fibroids of diameter larger then 10 cm.</P>
<P>None of the studies used GnRH pretreatment, so we cannot provide conclusions for women using GnRH pretreatment.</P>
<P>Repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later time were reported in only one study. The study population and the numbers of events for these outcomes were too small to show evidence of a difference between the two study groups.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we were not able to perform subgroup analyses because reporting of group characteristics was insufficient.</P>
<P>No studies compared hysteroscopic myomectomy versus open myomectomy.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-06 17:32:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We included nine studies with a total of 808 women. The quality of evidence varied for different analyses. We stated in our protocol that we would perform different subgroup analyses on size of myomas, number of myomas and GnRH pretreatment. Because data were insufficient, we could not perform these analyses. We included a small number of studies, so we did not make a funnel plot. Our conclusions for different outcomes are unstable, and additional studies are most likely to have an impact on our results. This is so because a high number of studies described unclear allocation concealment and only small subgroups of the included studies reported different outcomes. Therefore, our different analyses included rather small study populations. Additionally, only one of our studies blinded both participants and outcome assessors, and the other included studies were not double blind, or it was unclear whether any blinding was provided. The consistency of pooled estimates for our different outcomes when we have pooled data was good, as an overall low percentage of heterogeneity was reported. Our analyses of the outcomes haemoglobin drop and operating time showed substantial heterogeneity; therefore we have chosen to not pool the data for these outcomes. In conclusion, additional studies are very likely to have an impact on our results and might change the estimate. </P>

<P>Laparoscopic myomectomy is associated with less postoperative pain, lower incidence of postoperative febrile morbidity and a shorter hospital stay. Results on drop in haemoglobin level were not conclusive. The incidence of visceral injuries could not be estimated because of their low prevalence in this meta-analysis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-09-23 00:24:48 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one trial addressed changes in quality of life and menstrual symptoms after myomectomy. Further research is needed to address changes in quality of life after open or laparoscopic myomectomy performed with well-validated instruments. Future trials should include longer follow-up to assess the need for repeat surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy) among women undergoing myomectomy laparoscopically or by laparotomy.</P>
<P>The prevalence of visceral injury was low in studies included in the meta-analysis. However, studies with larger sample sizes are needed to detect differences between laparoscopic and open myomectomy.</P>
<P>With technical advances, better electrical morcellators have shortened the time required for removal of specimens and thus have reduced total operating time for laparoscopic myomectomy. Our review suggests that laparoscopic myomectomy requires significantly longer operative time, but more recent trials might report contrary findings as the result of better experience with laparoscopy and use of better instruments.</P>
<P>More studies are needed to evaluate laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy myomectomy compared with open and laparoscopic myomectomy. This procedure is less challenging technically, and it avoids endo suturing and morcellation.</P>
<P>No studies have compared hysteroscopic myomectomy versus open myomectomy. No studies have looked at uterine rupture, which is an important concern associated with myomectomy. More studies are needed to compare improvement in menstrual symptoms and changes in quality of life after myomectomy by laparoscopy versus open myomectomy.</P>

All participants had drains inserted for 24 hours after surgery in the lateral port or at the possible site of a lateral port in open surgery. For analgesia, we offered a patient-controlled system (PCA) for 24 hours after the operation. Participants were allowed a maximum of 4 doses of piritramide (0.05 mg · kg BW1 · h1). The numbers of doses of piritramide were recorded for each participants. After 24 h after surgery, subcutaneous injections of 7.5 mg of piritramide were given if requested by the participant.

By contrast, no more than 20% of patients were usually analgesic-free on day 2, discharged from the hospital by day 3, and feeling fully recuperated on day 15 after abdominal myomectomy. This sample size provides a power of 90% to detect such differences in comparing the two proportions at the 5% level. Moreover, the same sample size provides a power higher than 90% to detect a difference between group means as small as 1.7 cm of the visual analogue scale by use of two-factor analysis of variance for repeated measures at the 5% level"</P>

<P>Laparoscopic myomectomy (n = 68) versus mini-laparotomic myomectomy (n = 68)</P>
<P>
<B>Laparoscopic myomectomy:</B> In the laparoscopic group, procedures were performed using a 10-mm scope with 2 or 3 ancillary ports. A longitudinal incision, using a unipolar hook scissor, was performed close to the midline. After cleavage plane identification, the leiomyoma was enucleated by means of adequate traction with a myoma drill or a strong grasper and countertraction maneuvers with Manhes forceps or scissors, or a hydrodissection technique. Myometrium was sutured in 1 or 2 layers, according to the depth of the uterine defect, with interrupted figure-8 sutures, using intracorporeal knots. Morcellation was done with a 12-mm Steiner automatic morcellator</P>
<P>
<B>Mini-laparotomic myomectomy </B>(n = 68): A 4- to 7-cm transverse incision was made for mini-laparotomy access. To avoid extension of the mini-laparotomies, 2 double sutures were made at the ends of the skin incisions. The anterior rectus fascia was incised vertically, and the muscular fibers were dissected. The parietal peritoneum was exposed and incised vertically. The hysterotomy was performed with a monopolar knife on the most prominent part of each tumour, and the myoma was enucleated; interrupted figure-8 sutures in 1 or 2 layers were used to repair the uterus. Progressive morcellement of the leiomyomas was performed with a cold knife scalpel if the tumour was larger than the skin incision</P>
<P>
<B>Both groups: </B>Immediately before surgery, each participant received 2 g of IV cephalosporin as antibiotic prophylaxis. In both groups (laparoscopic and minilaparotomy), haemostasis was attained by bipolar coagulation of the tissue and vessels around the fibroids. A manipulator probe was used in both groups. Infiltration of the serosa or myometrium overlying the leiomyoma was performed before the uterine incision was made, with a solution of 50 mL of bupivacaine cloridrate 0.25% and 0.5 mL of epinephrine (0.5 vial of 1 mg/mL) in all cases. The uterine incision was performed using the same electrosurgical device with a cutting current of 70 W. At the end of each intervention, the pelvis was washed with saline solution. After the intervention, all participants received an IV bolus of tramadol (100 mg), followed by patient-controlled analgesia (tramadol 200 mg [2 vials] in 500 mL of saline solution). Postoperative analgesia was administered during the first 12 hours after surgery</P>
