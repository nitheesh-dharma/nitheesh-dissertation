<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:03:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many countries place emphasis on providing mental health services in the least restrictive setting, recognizing that some children will need to be admitted to hospital.  As a result there are a range of mental health services to manage young people with serious mental health problems in community or outpatient settings who are at risk of being admitted to hospital.</P>
<P>This review found seven studies which evaluated whether these other services helped children and young people with mental health problems.  This review did not find any studies about intensive day treatment (where children attend treatment programmes during the day for a short period of time), intensive case management (health care professionals coordinate services and support for the children), therapeutic foster care (children live with specially trained foster parents) or residential care with inpatient care (children live in a residence, but not a hospital, which provides mental health care services).</P>
<P>The studies evaluated four different types of services.  In <B>Multisystemic therapy (MST) at home</B>, therapists provide therapy to the child and the family together in their home.  Some behaviours in the children, improved with MST.  They also spent fewer days out of school and in hospital. <B>Intensive home treatment</B> provides children with therapy in their home to solve problems with the way they interact with other people in the home and to improve their psychological symptoms.  Children who received this type of service did not improve any more than children who did not.  <B>Intensive home based crisis intervention</B> (Homebuilders model for crisis intervention), focuses on the child and family to learn skills in relationship building, reframing problems, anger management, communication, and cognitive behavioural therapy.  Children with this service had small improvements. <B>Specialist outpatient services</B> are provided by a range of health care professionals in clinics.  Children who received this service did not improve any more than children who did not.</P>
<P>The quality of some of the studies was not high and most did not have enough people to evaluate the true effect of the services.  The evidence we now have provides very little guidance for the development of these types of services.</P>

<P>Current policy in the UK and elsewhere places emphasis on the provision of mental health services in the least restrictive setting, whilst also recognising that some children will require inpatient care. As a result, there are a range of mental health services to manage young people with serious mental health problems who are at risk of being admitted to an inpatient unit in community or outpatient settings.</P>

<P>1. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and cost of mental health services that provide an alternative to inpatient care for children and young people.<BR/>2.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-13 06:56:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our search included the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), EMBASE (1982 to 2006), the British Nursing Index (1994 to 2006), RCN database (1985 to 1996), CINAHL (1982 to 2006) and PsycInfo (1972 to 2007).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-11 05:01:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of mental health services providing specialist care, beyond the scope of generic outpatient provision, as an alternative to inpatient mental health care, for children or adolescents aged from five to 18 years who have a serious mental health condition requiring specialist services beyond the capacity of generic outpatient provision. The control group received mental health services in an inpatient or equivalent setting.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-11 05:03:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We grouped studies according to the intervention type but did not pool data because of differences in the interventions and measures of outcome. Where data were available we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between groups at follow up. We also calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for each outcome in terms of mean change from baseline to follow up using the follow-up SDs. We calculated SMDs (taking into account the direction of change and the scoring of each instrument) so that negative SMDs indicate results that favour treatment and positive SMDs favour the control group. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 08:06:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven randomised controlled trials (recruiting a total of 799 participants) evaluating four distinct models of care: multi-systemic therapy (MST) at home, specialist outpatient service, intensive home treatment and intensive home-based crisis intervention ('Homebuilders' model for crisis intervention). Young people receiving home-based MST experienced some improved functioning in terms of externalising symptoms and they spent fewer days out of school and out-of-home placement. At short term follow up the control group had a greater improvement in terms of adaptability and cohesion; this was not sustained at four months follow up. There were small, significant patient improvements reported in both groups in the trial evaluating the intensive home-based crisis intervention using the 'Homebuilders' model. No differences at follow up were reported in the two trials evaluating intensive home treatment, or in the trials evaluating specialist outpatient services.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 08:11:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence base currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. If randomised controlled trials are not feasible then consideration should be given to alternative study designs, such as prospective systems of audit conducted across several centres, as this has the potential to improve the current level of evidence. These studies should include baseline measurement at admission along with demographic data, and outcomes measured using a few standardised robust instruments. <BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-13 07:23:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 2100 young people in England and Wales are admitted to specialist child and adolescent mental health units each year (<LINK REF="REF-Worrall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worrall 2004</LINK>). The main users of these services are those with eating (25%), mood (approximately 17%) and psychotic disorders (approximately 17%) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Herlihy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Herlihy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Herlihy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Herlihy 2005</LINK>). Although the actual number of young people being admitted is relatively small, the impact of these conditions on the young person can be severe and prolonged, and the accompanying use of resources high, particularly for 16 to 17 year olds (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2005</LINK>). This has implications for a system where there is a shortage of specialised beds (<LINK REF="REF-Gowers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowers 2005</LINK>), with young people being admitted to general psychiatric or paediatric wards when specialist care is not available (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worrall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worrall 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although methods of case definition and ascertainment vary, the problems faced by other countries are broadly similar. In France, the emphasis is on providing services outside the hospital, however for those using the hospital for mental health services, 19% of inpatient psychiatric beds and 26% of day hospital places for young people are not in psychiatric hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Provost-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Provost 2001</LINK>). In the United States, where the health system is fragmented by multiple providers, children with serious mental health problems receive care in a range of different settings which include the education and social services sectors (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A range of mental health services, in the community or in an outpatient setting, have been developed to manage young people with serious mental health problems who are at high risk of being admitted to an inpatient unit (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF 2004</LINK>). These alternative services may prevent young people from developing a dependency on the hospital environment or from being stigmatised. In addition, they may facilitate the transfer of any therapeutic gains to the young person's everyday environment, thus maximising the potential for sustaining improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2004</LINK>) and for educational attainments to be less severely affected (<LINK REF="REF-Milin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milin 2000</LINK>). Examples include early intervention services in the community for young people with first episode psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-McGorry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 2002</LINK>), assertive outreach (<LINK REF="REF-McGorry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 2002</LINK>), dialectical behaviour therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>), family therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 2005</LINK>) and multi-family therapy for anorexia nervosa (<LINK REF="STD-Scholz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Scholz 2001</LINK>). The way services are organised also differs. Service configurations include the provision of multi-agency integrated home care (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>), therapeutic units based in a day unit, or multi-agency services providing intensive specialist outpatient therapy for young people with severe mental health problems (<LINK REF="REF-Street-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Street 2003</LINK>).</P>

<OL>
<LI>To classify and describe the different organisational structures and therapeutic approaches described in the literature as alternatives to inpatient mental health services for children and young people.</LI>
<LI>To determine the effectiveness, acceptability and cost of alternatives to inpatient care for children and young people.</LI>

<P>Two reviwers (LB and SS) read all the abstracts identified from the electronic search to identify publications that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. As a first step, because case definition can vary between countries and over time, we relied on the place of care being described as an alternative to inpatient care (or an equivalent). The same two reviewers (LB and SS) independently read selected full publications and they selected studies for inclusion according to the pre-specified inclusion criteria. One author (SS) read the abstracts and full publications from the updated search in August 2007. Two child and adolescent psychiatrists (SG and TJ) read a sample of these publications (n = 20) to check the inclusion criteria were applied consistently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We contacted principal investigators if information was missing and to clarify the relevance of non-English language studies. If the authors of non-English papers could not be contacted we translated the relevant parts of the paper.</P>

<P>During the data extraction process two authors independently assessed the internal validity of each included randomised controlled trial with the following criteria: concealment of allocation, baseline measurement, follow up of professionals, follow up of patients or episodes of care, baseline measurement, blind assessment of primary outcome(s), standardised measurement of outcome, reliable primary outcome measure(s) and protection against contamination (see <A HREF="http://www.epoc.cochrane.org/en/index.html">http://www.epoc.cochrane.org/en/index.html</A> for full details) (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-Module-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC Module 2007</LINK>). In essence, we assessed studies for selection bias (how groups were assigned to the intervention or control), baseline assessment (did the groups differ in fundamental ways), performance bias (were any co-interventions reported in one group and not the other ) and attrition bias (which was documented and described).</P>

<P>We planned to categorise studies and pool data by the type of intervention (organisational characteristics of the service and therapeutic approach) and study population.

</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 07:26:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have grouped studies according to the intervention type. Combining the data from the different studies was not possible as the interventions and measures of outcome differed. Empirical study outcomes are presented in summary tables. If follow-up data were available we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between groups to describe any differences in outcomes. These CIs reflect differences at outcome between groups without taking into account baseline group differences. This is because, while the studies generally presented baseline and follow-up scores, they did not usually present actual mean and standard deviation (SD) changes for each study group; it was therefore not possible to calculate the statistical significance of any group differences in terms of change from baseline. Moreover, different outcome measures were used across studies and thus the calculated 95% CIs cannot be directly compared.</P>
<P>To overcome both of these problems we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for each outcome in terms of the mean change from baseline to follow-up using the follow-up SDs. This method of using the follow-up SDs when the standard deviations of the change are not available (as in this review) was the method used by Gotzsche et al in their review of meta-analyses using SMDs (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2007</LINK>). In each case we calculated the SMDs (taking into account the direction of change and the scoring of each instrument) so that negative SMDs indicate results that favour treatment and positive SMDs favour the control group. We presented the SMDs and 95% CIs in a forest plot for each study.</P>

<P>Multi-systemic therapy (MST) follows a standard protocol and is a family-centred, ecologically orientated therapy targeting individual, family, peer and environmental aspects of psychopathology in the community (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>), and includes the development of aftercare plans (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>). Family therapy, behavioural therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are used (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2005</LINK>). Comprehensive crisis plans are developed jointly by the therapist and the child psychiatrist and focus on mobilising the problem-solving skills within the family and community (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Families are required to participate with the MST treatment programme through direct participation in both the assessment and family therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>). Family factors contributing to youth psychopathology are addressed as part of the intervention. Therapists work with families (three families per therapist) to design interventions that emphasise family empowerment and use family strengths as levers for change.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Operational characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The MST service is available 24 hours a day, seven days per week (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>). Therapists work with the young people within their own homes, in collaboration with their primary care givers. However, if psychiatric hospitalisation is required then therapists continue to provide services in these clinical settings. The workload of each therapist was three families to one provider, and the reported duration of treatment was a mean of 123 days (SD 29 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>). A standard protocol is used but the intensity of treatment is determined by the needs of the youth and their family; there was a mean of 97.1 hours of contact time (SD 57 hours) by one provider over 123 days (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>) compared with 12.07 hours per month (SD 4.62 hours) by another (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2005</LINK>).

<P>Gowers et al assessed the cost-effectiveness of a specialist outpatient service as an alternative to inpatient care, and compared this type of care with inpatient care or generic outpatient care for adolescents with anorexia nervosa in the United Kingdom. At two-year follow up no statistically significant differences were observed between the inpatient group and the specialist outpatient group in terms of the number of post-discharge nights spent at an inpatient facility, outpatient appointments or day patient contacts. Clinical costs of care per patient over two years based on their use of inpatient, outpatient, day hospital and Accident &amp; Emergency (A&amp;E) services did not differ. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of overall cost of care per patient when clinical, educational and community services were combined. Those allocated to general outpatients used more resources compared with the other two groups, which is reflected by an increased, though non-significant, cost. The control group had significantly fewer A&amp;E contacts, though this translates to a mean of 1 (SD 2) contacts in the specialist outpatient group, compared with a mean of 0 (SD 1) contacts in the other two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gowers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gowers 2007</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 09:00:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified eight distinct models of care providing an alternative to inpatient mental health care for children and adolescents: multi-systemic therapy (MST), intensive home-based crisis intervention ('Homebuilders' model for crisis intervention), intensive outpatient services (which could include rapid outreach and crisis intervention), intensive home treatment, day hospitals, case management, therapeutic foster care and short-term residential care. No randomised evidence was identified comparing intensive day treatment, intensive case management, therapeutic foster care or residential care with inpatient care or another alternative type of care.</P>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials evaluated the effectiveness of MST in the community as an alternative to inpatient or intensive community treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2005</LINK>). In both trials a number of different outcomes were measured using self, care giver and teacher reported data. The majority of differences were not significant. Henggeler et al reported improved functioning in terms of externalising symptoms for young people receiving home based MST. They also spent fewer days out of school and reported greater consumer satisfaction with their treatment programme. At short-term follow up the control group had a greater improvement in terms of adaptability and cohesion, though this was not sustained at four months follow up. Rowland et al reported fewer days spent in out-of-home placement for the MST group. A Cochrane Review of intensive MST for families and youth with social, emotional and behavioural problems across a range of settings found no evidence to support the use of this type of treatment compared with other interventions. However, this reflects the poor quality of the research evidence rather than the actual effectiveness of individual alternative services (<LINK REF="REF-Littell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littell 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence for intensive home based crisis intervention using the 'Homebuilders' model for crisis intervention as an alternative to inpatient care came from one randomised controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2003</LINK>). Although no differences were observed in either group for number of days in out-of-home placement, small improvements favouring the control group were reported at short-term follow up for behaviour, and favouring those receiving the enhanced 'Homebuilders' service in terms of adaptability and cohesion. At six-month follow up this group also had a greater improvement in social competency compared with the control group. However, the control group had a greater improvement in self concept.</P>
<P>Evidence for intensive home treatment came from two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Mattejat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mattejat 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winsberg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winsberg 1980</LINK>), with no differences between groups at follow up. These findings do not differ from a systematic review of home treatment for people with mental health problems, where the majority of participants were over the age of 18 years, which concluded that the evidence base for the effectiveness of this service was weak (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two RCTs evaluated the effectiveness of intensive specialist outpatient services and both reported no differences in behavioural or psychological outcomes for those receiving this form of care compared with children receiving no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Silberstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Silberstein 1968</LINK>), inpatient care or generic outpatient care (<LINK REF="STD-Gowers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gowers 2007</LINK>). Gowers et al concluded that specialist outpatient services for young people with anorexia nervosa are as effective as inpatient care.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cost effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>An analysis of costs was attempted by one of the trials evaluating intensive home-based MST as an alternative to inpatient treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>). However, the costs of the MST intervention and any outliers were omitted, therefore limiting the degree to which these results can be generalised. A second trial, reporting the results of the first economic evaluation of specialist outpatient care versus inpatient care versus generic outpatient care for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, reported no difference in costs between the three groups at two-year follow up. Interestingly, observed non-significant differences were due to the length of time spent in hospital, with the general outpatient group spending almost as much time in hospital as the inpatient group (<LINK REF="STD-Gowers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gowers 2007</LINK>). This lack of evidence on cost effectiveness is consistent with a recent report on the limited evidence from economic evaluations of early intervention services for psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-McCrone-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrone 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological issues</HEADING>
<P>Methodological limitations and a lack of evidence restrict the extent to which data from randomised studies can inform decision making. The quality of the studies included in this review was variable and most studies were under powered. Only one trial reported adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Gowers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gowers 2007</LINK>). Multiple testing was a problem for all studies with the risk of reporting a significant result by chance. In some studies up to 30 statistical tests were conducted with no adjustment for repeated testing. Many studies failed to report key features of the intervention, such as the duration or intensity of treatment, the staff involved or specific training requirements. This has important implications for replicating these interventions in future research, assessing treatment fidelity across studies, and for the development and implementation of evidence-based research programmes. Although obvious differences between the interventions can be identified, it is not possible to define the active ingredient within these interventions as each comprises a number of elements. Defining the precise therapeutic elements is also complex, including as they do the removal of the young person from their home in addition to prescribed therapies or drugs. Furthermore, standardising inpatient care is not possible as programmes differ in the make up of the multi-disciplinary teams they employ and the use of various therapies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Defining the intervention and control</HEADING>
<P>Over the last three decades the emphasis in several countries has been on the provision of mental health services for children in the least restrictive setting. In some cases this is a drive to control costs, but more often it reflects the policy of providing flexible and local child and adolescent mental health services that are perceived to confer a therapeutic advantage. For the purpose of this review the move towards alternative models that avoid inpatient care created some difficulties in selecting eligible studies as the type of care received by the control group was not always inpatient care but another community based alternative. In addition, it was sometimes difficult to disentangle services which aimed ultimately to avoid hospital admission through the provision of an innovative service as data were not provided to ascertain if this was achieved. A further complicating factor is the threshold for admission which tends to be broader for these alternative services compared with inpatient care, albeit recognising that thresholds will vary across inpatient services. As a result some patients admitted to these alternative services may not have been admitted to inpatient care. Of note, the expectation for some of the models providing an alternative to inpatient care was that the service would be provided for longer than the inpatient equivalent (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Extrapolating from a mainly North American evidence base to make recommendations about practice has some difficulties due to the multi-payer system of health care, variation in the way young people access and use mental health care services and the large number of uninsured children who do not qualify for public sector services. However, despite these difficulties there are some marked similarities regarding the policy focus across countries of providing flexible, local care for these young people in the least restrictive setting (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). The profile of young people admitted to these alternative services, the availability of local inpatient treatment, developing a systems approach to forge links between different agencies providing services (for example, exploring how mental health services operate within welfare and secure settings) and engaging families in treatment are all factors that need to be considered when developing these alternative services.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-13 09:05:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the current concerns about the scale and management of mental health problems in children and adolescents, a high priority should be attached to improvements in the quality of the evidence base which currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. The evidence highlights the need to move beyond monitoring and identifying variation in the types of services that are delivered, to the collection of robust data on the profile and outcomes of users of these alternative services. We suggest studies should be designed to compare different models of alternative services in terms of effectiveness and cost, focusing on those services that are most prevalent. For example, comparing intensive day treatment with home treatment or intensive outpatient treatment. It might be simpler in the first instance to design studies for services of specific disorders or symptoms (e.g. eating disorders, early onset psychosis) in order to compare data across sites. It may not be feasible to conduct a randomised controlled trial of these interventions due to difficulties in obtaining consent when one of the alternatives is inpatient care and problems with treatment fidelity. Implementing prospective comparative systems of audit are an alternative. By this we mean the prospective collection of data across several centres, which will include baseline measurement at admission along with demographic data. Outcomes should be measured using a few standardised robust instruments, for example the HoNOSCA system which has both clinical (<LINK REF="REF-Gowers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowers 1999</LINK>) and user rated versions (<LINK REF="REF-Gowers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowers 2002</LINK>). This would allow comparisons to be made of the differential effect of these services for children compared with adolescents, and between the different diagnostic categories.</P>
<P>Interestingly, few of the studies included in the review mentioned whether they consulted with service users and their parents, or the professionals treating them. This has made it difficult to establish the acceptability of the various alternative interventions included in this systematic review. Only two randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Henggeler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henggeler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winsberg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winsberg 1980</LINK>) included any measure of patient or care giver satisfaction. This has important implications for understanding the compliance and attrition problems associated with the delivery of mental health interventions. The evidence base would be improved by obtaining service users' views on any alternative service through qualitative research.</P>

<P>Family preservation service: the focus is on the identification of family and individual psychosocial, cultural, community and welfare needs. Components include relationship building, reframing problems, anger management, communication, setting treatment goals and cognitive behavioural therapy. The aim is to prevent an out-of-home placement for children at high risk. Short-term out-of-home placement from 3 days is permitted for respite care purposes in some cases. Services can respond 24 hours a day and are time limited, ranging from 6 to 12 weeks, with 2 families per therapist. Therapists are supervised by a child psychiatrist, who also provides consultation and referral services. Registered nurses and social workers also provide care.</P>

<P>Excluded because the intervention was a brief (5 sessions) family intervention delivered by child psychiatric social workers, with the first session being held in the hospital or home, and subsequent sessions at home. The control group received outpatient care by a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse, this was less intensive than that described by Rowland and was not considered equivalent to inpatient care. We also looked at the economic evaluation of the Harrington trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gowers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gowers 2007</LINK> to assess the intensity of care in the control group, to ensure our decision to exclude this trial was consistent with the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
