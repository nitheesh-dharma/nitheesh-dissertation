<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-09-15 09:57:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention where physical activity or exercise was considered to be the main or active ingredient with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:26:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, quality assessed and data extracted. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. We synthesised non-skewed data from valid scales using a weighted mean difference (WMD).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-10 13:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials assessed the effects of exercise on physical and mental health. Overall numbers leaving the trials were similar. Two trials compared exercise to standard care and both found exercise to significantly improve negative symptoms of mental state (Mental Health Inventory Depression:1RCT, n=10, MD 17.50 CI 6.70 to 28.30, PANSS negative: 1RCT, n=10, MD -8.50 CI -11.11 to -5.89). No absolute effects were found for positive symptoms of mental state. Physical health improved significantly in the exercise group compared to those in standard care (1RCT, n=13, MD 79.50 CI 33.82 to 125.18), but no effect on peoples' weight/BMI was apparent. One trial compared exercise with yoga and found that yoga had a better outcome for mental state (PANSS total: 1RCT, n=41, MD 14.95 CI 2.60 to 27.30). The same trial also found those in the yoga group had significantly better quality of life scores (WHOQOL Physical: 1RCT, n=41, MD -9.22 CI -18.86 to 0.42). Adverse effects (AIMS total scores) were, however, similar.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-10 09:39:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of this Cochrane review are similar to existing reviews that have examined the health benefits of exercise in this population. Although studies included in this review are small and used various measures of physical and mental health, results indicated that regular exercise programmes are possible in this population, and that they can have healthful effects on both the physical and mental health and well-being of individuals with schizophrenia. Larger randomised studies are required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-14 12:18:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For people with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, improvement in quality of life tends to enhance the individual&#8217;s ability to cope with and manage their disorder. As such, physical activity has the potential to improve quality of life for people with mental health disorders through two routes: physical and psychological (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2006</LINK>). In terms of physical health, individuals with mental health disorders have the same physical health needs as the general population. Individuals with serious mental illness are more likely to be sedentary than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamove-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamove 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2001</LINK>) and are consequently at high risk for chronic medical conditions associated with inactivity. For example, much of the increase in chronic medical illness among individuals with serious mental illness may be attributed to the increased prevalence of obesity in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Goff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goff 2005</LINK>) and physical inactivity likely contributes to this increased prevalence. In terms of mental health, positive psychological effects from physical activity in clinical populations have been reported even among those individuals who experience no objective diagnostic improvement. Improved quality of life is particularly important for individuals with severe and enduring mental health problems when complete remission may be unrealistic (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 1999</LINK>). For example, there is a potential role for exercise in the treatment of schizophrenia, <LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005</LINK> concludes that exercise may alleviate secondary symptoms of schizophrenia such as depression, low self-esteem and social withdrawal. </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-15 10:22:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is characterised by (1) psychotic positive symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech and thinking, (2) behavioural negative symptoms such as avolition, alogia, blunted or flattened affect and (3) serious neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 1994</LINK>). Individuals who live with schizophrenia experience distortions of reality, changes in thinking and perceptions, difficulties in social situations, and problems with daily functions. Based on current estimates from epidemiological studies, approximately 15.2 in 100,000 individuals develop schizophrenia annually with a lifetime prevalence of 4 in 1,000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-06-03 17:15:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physical activity is a term that describes any bodily movement that is produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure above rest (<LINK REF="REF-Caspersen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caspersen 1985</LINK>). Exercise is a form of physical activity that is "planned, structured, repetitive, and purposive in the sense that improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is an objective." (<LINK REF="REF-Caspersen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caspersen 1985</LINK>, p.128).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-12-17 22:03:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In terms of physical activity, no single mechanism has yet been found to adequately explain the diverse range of mental health effects possible through physical activity participation. At present, the plausible mechanisms for psychological change through physical activity and exercise fall into one of three broad perspectives: (1) biochemical changes such as increased levels of neurotransmitters (e.g. endorphins or serotonin), (2) physiological changes such as improved cardiovascular and muscle function, thermogenesis and, (3) psychological changes such as social support, sense of autonomy, improved perceptions of competence, enhanced body image, self-efficacy and distraction (<LINK REF="REF-Mutrie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutrie 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-09-15 10:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a growing recognition that physical activity can enhance mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005b</LINK>). With regard to the effects of exercise on schizophrenia, there is limited evidence to suggest that such benefits are also reported in populations characterised by serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Studies tend to consist mostly of case reports but some group studies do exist (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005</LINK>). Based on this evidence, there is some tentative support that participating in exercise is associated with an alleviation of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as depression, low self esteem and social withdrawal. There is less evidence that exercise may be a useful coping strategy for dealing with positive symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005</LINK>). These conclusions are drawn primarily from studies of pre-experimental design. The purpose of this review is to focus specifically on methodologically rigorous trials in updating current consensus concerning the potential role of exercise in improving the mental health of individuals with schizophrenia.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-09-22 13:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PG and GF independently assessed the methodological quality of all relevant studies. Criteria in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) was used to evaluate the quality of each trial on the following items:</P>
<P>1. sequence generation;</P>
<P>2. allocation concealment;</P>
<P>3. blinding;</P>
<P>4. incomplete outcome data;</P>
<P>5. selective reporting of the results;</P>
<P>6. any other biases identified.</P>
<P>Each item was rated on level of bias. A 'YES' rating identified that there was a low risk of bias while a 'NO' rating meant there was a high risk of bias. Where a risk of bias could not be determined, the item was given a rating of 'UNCLEAR.' Due to the small number of identified trials, all studies that were identified as randomised were included in the review, regardless of how many total biases they possessed.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:28:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For statistically significant results we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using <A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">Visual Rx</A> taking account of the event rate in the control group. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect.<BR/>
<BR/>1.2 Binary outcomes from scale data<BR/>Continuous outcome measures were not converted to binary data by identifying specific cut-off points on rating scales. Binary data were only used if they were clearly identified as dichotomous outcomes.</P>
<P>2. Continuous data<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in mental health trials are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to all endpoint data derived from continuous measures. The criteria were used before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means had to be obtainable; and, for finite scores, such as endpoint measures on rating scales, (b) the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by 2 had to be less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>Skewed endpoint data from studies with less the 200 participants were not shown graphically, but were added to 'Other data' tables and briefly commented on in the text. However, skewed endpoint data from larger studies (=/&gt;200 participants) pose less of a problem and we entered the data for analysis.</P>
<P>For continuous mean change data (endpoint minus baseline) the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if change data are skewed. The RevMan meta-analyses of continuous data are based on the assumption that the data are, at least to a reasonable degree, normally distributed. Therefore we included such data, unless endpoint data were also reported from the same scale.</P>
<P>2.1 Intention-to-treat analysis<BR/>For dichotomous data a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' approach was taken and it was assumed that all those lost to follow-up had relapsed. For continuous data a 'last-observation-carried-forward' (LOCF) approach, which maintains the sample size, was used in this review.<BR/>
<BR/>2.2 Summary statistics<BR/>In the case of continuous outcome measurement, a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again if evidence of heterogeneity was found a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>2.3 Scale derived data<BR/>Data obtained using a scale were only included if its psychometric properties (i.e. concerning reliability and validity) were reported in a peer reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Furthermore these data were only included if the scale was either self-report or completed by an independent rater or a relative and not the therapist or provider of the intervention.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-10-20 11:52:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This can cause Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over trials<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=FD696D0582E26AA20087011CF1CB5330%26format=REVMAN#REF-Elbourne-2002">Elbourne 2002</A>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we will only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>

<P>1. Overall loss of credibility<BR/>At some degree of loss to follow up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2007</LINK>). Since there is no evidence as to the degree of attrition which makes a reasonable analysis of the data possible, we included all trials in the main analysis. If, for a given outcome, more than 50% of the total numbers randomised were not accounted for we did not present results as such data will be impossible to interpret with authority.</P>
<P>2. Binary<BR/>Where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0 and 50%, and outcomes of these individuals are described, we included these data in our analysis.</P>

<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects.

For this reason we favour using the fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>We included three randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>). All studies have been published since 2005 which possibly illustrates growing attention to the role of exercise as a form of adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia. One study investigated the effects of an exercise programme that included both aerobic and strength training components (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>). This programme was 12 weeks in length, included a warm up session, 30-60 minutes of aerobic fitness, 15-20 minutes of strength training, and 5-10 minutes of cool down. Participants in this trial met twice a week. The other two studies evaluated the effects of a walking programme (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>) and a light exercise programme (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> study, researchers evaluated the effects of a 16 week walking programme where participants met for 10-30 minutes three times per week. In the <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK> study, researchers evaluated the effects of a 16 week light exercise programme that consisted of light walking, jogging, stretching, and relaxation techniques. Participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK> study met for one hour five times per week.</P>
<P>1. Methods<BR/>All trials were randomised and two were single-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).

<P>2. Participants<BR/>All trials included people diagnosed with schizophrenia using DSM-IV criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>). Two studies included both in- and outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>), while one concentrated solely on outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>). Approximately 96 participants were initially recruited into the studies and there were more male than female participants included. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 63 years with a mean age of 32.4 years.</P>
<P>3. Setting<BR/>Two studies were conducted in hospital settings that offered in- and outpatient services (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>). One study was conducted in a community centre (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Study size<BR/>All studies utilised small samples and ranged in size from from 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>) to 61 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).

<P>5. Interventions<BR/>5.1 Exercise: The experimental conditions identified in each of the included studies differed in exercise duration and intensity. The exercise programme in the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> study included 3 exercise sessions per week that consisted of a 10 minute warm-up and walking on a treadmill. Over the course of the study, participants increased their walking time from 5 minutes on the first day to 30 minutes.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK> study, the programme consisted of brisk walking, jogging, exercises in standing and sitting postures and relaxation. Participants underwent three weeks of training and then continued with the programme for the remaining three months. Participants met for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> study, the programme consisted of a 10 minute warm-up, 20 minutes of resistance weight training, 60 minutes of aerobic training, and a 5 minute cool-down. Participants met twice a week for 12 weeks. Each session was 90 minutes in length. Participants were encouraged to exercise one additional time per week independently.<BR/>
<BR/>All exercise programmes were in addition to participants usual care.</P>
<P>5.2. Control interventions<BR/>5.2.1 Standard care: In the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> study, participants continued with their usual treatment but told they were on a waiting list for the exercise therapy. At the conclusion of this study, those in the standard care group were given the opportunity to take part in the experimental treatment. Participants in the control group of the <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> study continued with treatment as usual.<BR/>
<BR/>5.2.2 Other treatment: Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK> study took part in yoga classes five times per week that lasted one hour in length. Again participation in yoga classes was in addition to usual care.<BR/>

<P>6.1.1 Mental state (with particular reference to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia)<BR/>6.1.1.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A lower score indicates lesser severity. Two studies reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.1.1.2 Mental Health Inventory (MHI) (<LINK REF="REF-Veit-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veit 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1998</LINK>)<BR/>This self-report scale has 18 items that measure anxiety, depression, behavioural control, and positive affect. It offers a total mental health score as well as sub scores for each of the subscales. Each item on the scale has six response options, with higher values indicating better mental health. The <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> study reversed the presentation and subsequent analysis of the depression subscale for easier comprehension of results. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.1.2 General functioning<BR/>6.1.2.1 Social and Occupational Functioning Scale - SOFS (<LINK REF="REF-Saraswat-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saraswat 2006</LINK>)<BR/>This scale has 14 items, each of which can be defined on a 5-point scale where 1= no impairment and 5 = extreme impairment. This scale examines bathing and grooming, dressing, eating, neatness, conversational skills, social appropriateness, social engagement, money management, orientation/mobility, social skills, recreation, work relationships, respect for property and independence. Higher scores on the SOFS indicate greater social impairment. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.1.3 Adverse effects<BR/>6.1.3.1 Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This 10-item scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.1.3.2 Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Munetz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munetz 1988</LINK>)<BR/>AIMS is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dystonia and chronic akathisia, as well as 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in three main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>6.1.4 Quality of life<BR/>6.1.4.1 World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF Version, WHOQOL-BREF (<LINK REF="REF-Skevington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skevington 2004</LINK>)<BR/>This scale is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assessment. The scale assesses physical health, psychological, social relations and the environment on a five-point scale where 1 = poor QofL and 5 = good QofL. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2 Other outcomes<BR/>6.2.1 Physical fitness<BR/>6.2.1.1 Six Minute Walk Test (<LINK REF="REF-Enright-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enright 1998</LINK>)<BR/>This test measures level of aerobic fitness.

Two studies reported data using this test (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.1.2 Maximal Strength<BR/>Maximal strength was measured by one repetition maximum test on the bicep curl exercise. One study reported data using this test (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.2 Cardiovascular measures<BR/>One study reported data on resting blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.3 Weight<BR/>6.2.3.1 Body Mass Index<BR/>Height and weight were captured using calibrated and standardized measurements (e.g., stadiometer, balance-beam scale). BMI = weight in kg/height in meters squared. Two studies reported pre and post measures of BMI of their participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.3.2 Percentage Body Fat<BR/>Participants' percentage body fat was obtained through skinfold callipers. A three site method was used to measure the triceps, abdominal, and suprailiac skin folds (American College of Sports Medicine, 1995). One study reported data on percentage body fat (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.3.3 Waist and hip circumference<BR/>Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus and hip circumference was measured at the largest circumference of the hips. One study reported waist circumference (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Two studies reported a loss of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>), but all three studies reported detailed information on the number of participants throughout their studies.</P>

<P>The included studies varied considerably in the designs of their respective exercise programmes and what variables they measured. Two of the included studies examined aspects of both physical and mental health (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>), and one study only looked at improvements in mental health (<LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>). In general, all included studies showed positive mental and physical health effects associated with exercise participation.</P>
<P>1. COMPARISON 1. EXERCISE versus STANDARD CARE<BR/>Although two studies compared exercise to standard care, results could only be pooled for one outcome, leaving the study early.<BR/>
</P>
<P>1.1 Mental State<BR/>1.1.1 Mental Health Inventory (MHI)<BR/>During the 12 week <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> trial scale ratings of mental health increased from a baseline M=56.3(SD 10.5) to endpoint M=65.5 (SD 9.0) (p&lt; .03) in the exercise group, but these scores were not significantly different to those found in the standard care group (n=10, MD 7.40 CI -2.46 to 17.26). There were significant differences observed between groups for depression (n=10, MD 17.50 CI 6.70 to 28.30) and anxiety scores (n=10, MD 8.00 CI 0.80 to 15.20). No significant differences were observed for positive affect (n=10, MD 3.30 CI -23.66 to 30.26) and behavioural scores (n=10, MD -5.40 CI -21.28 to 10.48).<BR/>
<BR/>1.1.2 PANSS scores<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> found those in the exercise group had significantly better PANSS negative scores than those in standard care (n=10, MD -8.5 CI -11.11 to -5.89). A similar favourable effect for exercise was found for positive scores, this result was just significant (n=10, MD -2.5 CI -4.73 to -0.27).</P>
<P>
<BR/>1.2 Physical fitness<BR/>1.2.1 Six Minute Walking Distance<BR/>Two studies examined the distance participants could walk in six minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>). Data from <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> could not be used in the analysis as no SD were provided. Although both studies observed increases in the distance covered by their respective exercise groups, only participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> increased their distance travelled significantly (n=13, MD 79.50 CI 33.82 to 125.18).</P>
<P>1.2.2 Maximal Strength<BR/>One study reported on maximal strength (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>). Participants in the exercise group reported a significant increase in strength (n=13, MD 2.00 CI 0.55 to 3.45).</P>
<P>1.2.3 Cardiovascular measures<BR/>One study reported on cardiovascular measures. The <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> study reported on data on resting blood pressure and revealed no significant improvements (n=13, MD -1.00 CI -8.05 to 6.05).</P>

<P>1.3.2 Percentage Body Fat<BR/>One study examined changes in percentage body fat (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>). Participants in the exercise group reduced their body fat by 3.7% which was significantly larger than the 0.02% reduction experienced by those in the control group (p&lt; .03), however, standard deviations were not provided for the <LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK> study and so data are not analysed in this review, the authors have been contacted.</P>
<P>1.3.3 Waist and hip circumference<BR/>One study reported data on waist and hip circumferences and noted no effect (<LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK>) (n=13, MD 0.01 CI -0.02 to 0.04).</P>

<P>2. COMPARISON 2. EXERCISE versus OTHER TREATMENT<BR/>One study (n=61) provided data for this comparison <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>. The other treatment for this trial were regular sessions of yoga.<BR/>
</P>
<P>2.1 Mental State<BR/>2.1.1 PANSS Total<BR/>Participants in the yoga group reported a significantly lower overall Total PANSS score than those in the exercise group (n=41, MD 14.95 CI 2.60 to 27.30).</P>
<P>2.1.1.1 PANSS Depression<BR/>When reporting PANSS Depression score, those in the yoga group had more favourable scores, the difference between groups was just significant (n=41, MD 2.89 CI 0.86 to 4.92).</P>
<P>2.1.1.2 PANSS Anergia<BR/>Those practising yoga reported a just significantly lower PANSS Anergia score than those in the exercise group (n=41, MD 2.40 CI 0.47 to 4.33).</P>

<P>The Searches</P>
<P>Electronic searching produced 442 electronic reports, 21 of which were selected for further examination. Overall, three studies were included given they met the eligibility criteria for this review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:31:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were included in this review. Overall, these studies showed that exercise therapy can have an impact on mental health outcomes like mental state and general functioning with no adverse effects and a limited effect on physical health outcomes such as weight. The included studies illustrate that randomised controlled trials that examine the mental health effects of physical activity are possible to conduct with individuals with schizophrenia although they are characterised by their short-term nature and small samples. Importantly, attrition rates were similar in the trials with no significant differences between groups. All of the included studies have been conducted within the last four years which suggests that researchers have responded to calls for greater methodological rigour (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005</LINK>). Although these studies have been conducted recently and are more methodologically rigorous than those conducted in the past, it was not possible to combine their findings to calculate weighted mean difference or risk ratios. Results have been stratified below according to mental health and physical health outcomes.</P>
<P>1. Mental Health<BR/>
</P>
<P>Overall, findings show that exercise improves mental health measures, specifically negative symptoms, compared to standard care, but when exercise is compared to other types of exercise, such as yoga, the benefits of exercise are not as profound. Findings should be viewed with caution as results are based on a limited number of trials that had small sample sizes.</P>
<P>2. Physical Health<BR/>Several physical health measures were examined in this review. Although participants in the exercise arm of <LINK REF="STD-Marzaloni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marzaloni 2008</LINK> study improved their physical fitness, overall, studies did not find significant changes in physical health outcomes that measured BMI, waist to hip ratio, final weight, or resting blood pressure. This may reflect the relatively short nature of the described intervention studies, or a lack of adherence to the exercise intervention. Given that individuals with schizophrenia live with various co-morbidities which often stem from overweight or obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2003</LINK>), this review reinforces the need for further research examining how to get this population physically active in order to receive physical health benefit.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-08 22:09:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, several results from the three included studies show that mental health and physical fitness improves with exercise; however, given the small number of included studies, and the use of various instruments used to measure different aspects of mental and physical health, these findings must be viewed with caution. Furthermore, a wide variety of physical health outcomes such as BMI, waist to hip ratio, final weight, and resting blood pressure, did not improve significantly.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-14 12:58:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the included studies data reporting was inconsistent. All future studies should respect standards of measuring outcomes and of reporting data in order to enhance the comparability of study results (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to strengthen the quality of future randomised controlled trials, researchers should attempt to limit the number of study biases. These biases include selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting. In this Cochrane review, selection biases were observed in all three included studies. Only two studies utilised methods of generating a sequence of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>) and none of the studies concealed their group allocations. Failure to conceal group allocations may indicate an inability to adhere to the randomly generated results of group allocation. Future studies should utilise some form of sequence generation such as a random number generator or a randomisation schedule and conceal their randomisation results by placing them in sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although researchers may not blind participants to behavioural interventions to remove threats of performance biases, every attempt should be made to collect study data in a blind manner. In this review, only two of the included studies were single blind (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>). Researchers conducting future studies should at least blind study personnel to group allocation in order to guard against detection biases in order to minimise any exaggeration of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lastly, adherence is a great concern for researchers that conduct studies that include individuals with schizophrenia. Future research should address issues of programme adherence and researchers should pay careful attention to barriers that prevent regular exercise.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-09-03 22:25:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although a thorough and extensive search and review was undertaken, potential biases may still exist. Throughout this review process, we found very few randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. Publication bias may exist and may threaten the results given that all research studies do not get published in major journals that may be identified through CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Additionally, language may present an additional challenge as a great deal of research is not being published in English. Several steps are being taken to translate numerous studies, evaluate them, and determine if they should be included in the next stage of this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-06-03 17:48:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two other reviews have identified and reviewed existing research studies that used exercise as a form of adjunct therapy for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2007</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2005</LINK>). These reviews examined various forms of research methods including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Their results are in line with this review. Both reviews indicated that exercise can improve physical and psychological health and social well-being in this population. Additionally, both reviews stressed the need for more methodologically rigorous research to be conducted given that most studies had used pre-experimental designs. This review suggests such calls are starting to be addressed.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:04:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:02:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>The results of this review indicate that there are various benefits to exercise. Individuals with schizophrenia can improve components of mental health by participating in regular exercise. However, clear guidance regarding what dose of exercise works best for improving mental health is limited by the small number of studies and the variability of the interventions themselves as well as their intensity and duration. People with schizophrenia should ask their clinician for support and advice regarding getting more physically active. Current guidelines for lifestyle activity and exercise appear just as acceptable to individuals with schizophrenia in terms of potential mental health benefit. That is, accumulating 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most or all days of the week remains a good guideline. In terms of short term goals, sedentary individuals could be encouraged to participate in two thirty-minute sessions of moderate activity a week. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Given the physical, mental, and social benefits of regular exercise, clinicians should ensure their clients are becoming and staying active. Although research shows that the physical health of clients may be neglected by health care practitioners and systems (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2003</LINK>), multidisciplinary approaches need to be taken to provide clients with information about and opportunities to take part in regular exercise. Both psychiatrists and general physicians need to take responsibility for both the physical and mental well-being of their clients. Additionally, all physicians should take into consideration the negative symptoms of schizophrenia when prescribing any exercise programme. Although exercise has been shown to improve negative symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Beebe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beebe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duraiswamy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Duraiswamy 2007</LINK>), clients may at first be too unmotivated to begin an exercise programme. Not only do the health and social benefits of exercise need to be emphasised, but careful attention needs to be paid to various barriers that prevent clients from exercise. Before recommending any exercise programme, clinicians could pay specific attention to and address mental illness symptoms, medication side effects, safety concerns, stigma, and structural barriers (e.g., transportation, social economic status). In addition to addressing barriers to exercise, clinicians should structure programmes to be informative, flexible, allow clients to progress at their own pace, and offer motivational leadership.</P>
<P>3. For policy makers<BR/>Individuals with schizophrenia have an increased chance of having one or more morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2003</LINK>). Clinicians need to carefully screen clients for both physical and mental health conditions and pay attention to the health needs of clients (<LINK REF="REF-Lykouras-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lykouras 2008</LINK>). Research has shown that multidisciplinary approaches to health care can have a profound positive impact on the health and well-being of clients and address issues such as helping clients maintain regular appointments and assisting them with communication difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2003</LINK>). Also research has shown that through multidisciplinary approaches, clinicians spend more time with clients and address more of their health needs. Through these types of treatment approaches, clinicians may be able to offer more information to clients about the importance of exercise as an adjunct treatment for schizophrenia and be able to address specific barriers clients may have that prevent them from participating and adhering to regular exercise. Policy makers should consider the implementation of such multidisciplinary programmes within their respective treatment facilities.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-14 13:04:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>All future studies should respect standards of measuring outcomes and of reporting data in order to enhance the comparability of study results (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). In the included studies data reporting was inconsistent.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>In future research, the exact nature of the exercise programme must be clearly defined with the duration, frequency, and intensity of exercise reported. Adherence must also be clearly reported. Changes in fitness levels should also be documented as well as the incorporation of follow-up measures in research designs. The participants should be clearly described in terms of their age, sex, diagnosis, duration of illness, and medication regimen. Outcome measures should include measures relevant to schizophrenia-related symptomatology, particularly the negative symptoms, and consider broader clinical outcomes such as use of health services, medication compliance, and rate of relapse. </P>
<P>Although the included studies in this Cochrane review described their exercise programmes in detail, all the studies neglected to disclose specific behavioural theories and aspects of exercise intensity, duration, and frequency. In order to examine the full physical and mental health effects of exercise, researchers should consider proposing specific theories and defining and measuring specific aspects of the exercise conducted by participants. Specifically, we need to know how best to get this population engaged in exercise programmes and continuing participation. All of the identified studies did not describe the theoretical basis for how behaviour change was being facilitated. Comparison of lifestyle and structured interventions to increase physical activity should also be conducted as we do not know whether less structured interventions can work with this population. Their flexibility, lower cost, and easy integration into daily schedules might be particularly appealing to individuals with schizophrenia. </P>
