<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection.</P>
<P>Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods:</P>
<P>&#8226; simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants);</P>
<P>&#8226; medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants);</P>
<P>&#8226; anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants);</P>
<P>&#8226; keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises.</P>
<P>Researchers found no evidence that corticosteroid injection was effective in improving symptoms of UNE.</P>
<P>We were able to combine results from three trials comparing two surgical techniques: simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve (subcutaneous or submuscular). We found no important difference in symptom scores between the techniques at 6 to 12 months. Decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. Trialists found no clinical differences between surgical techniques in the other surgical trials. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma (an abnormal collection of blood) after surgery.</P>
<P>Evidence was insufficient for us to choose the best treatment for UNE. However, we did find that in mild cases, information on movements and positions to avoid may reduce discomfort. Moreover, the combined results from three surgical trials provided moderate-quality evidence that simple decompression surgery and decompression with transposition may be equally effective, but that decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to 31 May 2016.</P>

<P>Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012.</P>

<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether:</P>
<P>- surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function;</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-14 13:35:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-19 16:07:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:20:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:20:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta-analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison.</P>
<P>We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate-quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI -0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes.</P>
<P>In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function.</P>
<P>One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low-quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement.</P>
<P>One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow-up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:21:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta-analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate-quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Its mean annual crude incidence is 24.7 cases per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Mondelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mondelli 2005</LINK>). One of the sites of entrapment is the cubital tunnel. The tunnel is defined by Osbourne's ligament, the medial collateral ligament of the elbow, the elbow joint capsule, and the olecranon (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2010</LINK>). The clinical picture is typically characterised by paraesthesias involving the fourth and fifth finger, pain at the elbow, sensory symptoms with prolonged flexion of the elbow, and in severe cases motor deficit of the ulnar innervated hand muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Dellon-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellon 1989</LINK>). Diagnosis is based on signs, symptoms, and electrodiagnostic studies (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2005</LINK>). Imaging, particularly ultrasound, in <LINK REF="REF-Beekman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beekman 2004</LINK>, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in <LINK REF="REF-Bordalo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordalo 2004</LINK>, is gaining more attention as a sensitive diagnostic tool. Provocative clinical tests are not reliable or useful in the diagnosis of UNE (<LINK REF="REF-Beekman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beekman 2009</LINK>). Electrodiagnostic examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, quantify the severity, and identify the exact site of ulnar nerve compression (<LINK REF="REF-AAEM-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAEM 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padua-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padua 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-19 16:07:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Treatment of UNE may be conservative (splint device, physical therapy, rehabilitation) or surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Bartels-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartels 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartels-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartels 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK>). The goal of conservative treatment is to eliminate or reduce the frequency of external compression on the nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Dellon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2005</LINK>). Regarding surgical therapy, many procedures are employed for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome, including simple decompression, anterior transposition (subcutaneous, submuscular, and intramuscular), and medial epicondylectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Eaton-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaton 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuschner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The basis for choosing a surgical technique must relate to the pathophysiology of the compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, an understanding of the aetiology of the ulnar nerve compression in a particular case, and the potential drawbacks of the various operative procedures. Despite the different options for treating UNE, optimal management remains controversial. This review was first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:22:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We assessed clinical heterogeneity by comparing the distribution of important participant factors between trials (age, gender, clinical impairment, neurophysiological impairment, and associated diseases) and trial factors (randomisation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, losses to follow-up, treatment type, and co-interventions). We assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, a quantity which approximately describes the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. In addition, we planned to employ a Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test to determine the strength of the evidence that heterogeneity was genuine.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:41:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In order to detect potential publication bias, we would plot RRs and 95% CIs against standard errors in each study (funnel plots). Asymmetry in such plots could be due to publication bias, but could also be due to a relationship between trial size and effect size.

<P>To evaluate the clinical outcome we included three studies in the meta-analysis: <LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK> (152 participants; 5 lost to follow-up), <LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK> (70 participants), and <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK> (44 participants). The three studies compared simple decompression with transposition of the ulnar nerve. In two studies the latter was a submuscular transposition (<LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK>), and in one study, it was anterior subcutaneous transposition (<LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK>). A total of 131 participants were treated by simple decompression, and a total of 130 participants were treated by transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous). In all three studies the participants had clinical and electrophysiological evidence of ulnar nerve impairment.</P>
<P>We performed two different evaluations to assess the effectiveness of surgery. In the first, we compared simple decompression with subcutaneous transposition (<LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK>), and in the second analysis, we compared simple decompression with submuscular transposition (<LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK> used clinical scores to assess changes after surgical treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK> used a clinical score and a neurophysiological evaluation. The clinical outcome measures in the three studies varied. <LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK> used a clinical scale that included a combination of historical and physical findings (evaluation of sensation and muscular strength); <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK> used the McGowan score and Louisiana State University Medical Center (LSUMC) score, both of which graded the sensory and muscular deficits; and <LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK> evaluated the clinical picture preoperatively by Dellon&#8217;s classification and postoperatively by the Bishop score. Dellon&#8217;s staging system includes the assessment of sensory and motor function and the response to provocative tests. The Bishop score assesses objective and subjective parameters: grip strength, sensory measurement of static two-point discrimination, severity of residual symptoms, subjective improvement compared with the preoperative period, and preoperative and postoperative work status.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2005</LINK> performed a clinical follow-up at one year after surgery; <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 2006</LINK> at six weeks and six months after surgery; and <LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK> at six months after surgery (clinical and neurophysiological assessment). At the six-month follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK> performed a neurophysiological assessment in all the participants in both groups. These investigators also performed a second clinical follow-up (the mean duration of the second follow-up was 47 months for the simple decompression group and 46.9 months for the anterior submuscular transposition group).</P>
<P>We also performed a meta-analysis of neurophysiological outcome, including two papers (<LINK REF="STD-Gervasio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gervasio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2005</LINK> (66 participants) compared two surgical procedures: subcutaneous anterior transposition and decompression without transposition. Thirty-two participants underwent simple nerve decompression, and 34 had subcutaneous transposition. All participants had clinical and electrophysiological evidence of ulnar neuropathy. The main outcome measure was motor conduction velocity across the elbow, although the trialists also assessed muscular strength of ulnar innervated muscles pre- and postoperatively. All the participants in both groups underwent neurophysiological assessment. The investigators performed follow-up examinations at three months and nine months after surgery.</P>
<P>We included five other studies in the review but not in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Geutjens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Geutjens 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svernlov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svernlov 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zarezadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zarezadeh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanVeen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">vanVeen 2015</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Geutjens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Geutjens 1996</LINK> (47 participants) compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition in people with clinical and electrophysiological evidence of ulnar neuropathy. The authors measured the clinical outcome by:</P>

<LI>evaluation of sensation by light touch and static two-point discrimination; and</LI>
<LI>assessment of pain in the hand by a non-validated five-item scale.</LI>

<P>The neurophysiological outcome was measured by ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity in all the participants in both groups. All the evaluations were performed before treatment and at 12 months. Participant satisfaction was assessed by a non-validated tool.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Svernlov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Svernlov 2009</LINK> (51 participants) compared three groups treated conservatively with:</P>
<OL>
<LI>night splinting for three months and "written information of the anatomy of the ulnar nerve, an explanation of the probable pathomechanics and the regimen regarding the avoidance of movements and positions provoking the symptoms";</LI>
<LI>nerve gliding exercises and the same written information;</LI>
<LI>written information only.</LI>
</OL>
<P>All the participants had clinically mild or moderate UNE, classified with the Dellon&#8217;s staging system. All participants underwent electrophysiological assessment preoperatively, but only 12 participants had abnormal findings. The clinical outcome measures were: (1) evaluation of fifth-digit and grip strength, measured by two different dynamometers; and (2) the VAS. Electrophysiological outcomes were ulnar motor and sensory nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Participants assessed their symptoms according to the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The COPM is a 10-point scale that measures the person&#8217;s own opinion of his or her ability to perform occupational activities and satisfaction with performance. The investigators evaluated the participants in the three groups before the treatment and at six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zarezadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zarezadeh 2012</LINK> (48 participants) compared anterior subcutaneous transposition with anterior submuscular transposition in participants with clinical and electrophysiological evidence of ulnar neuropathy.

<LI>subjective evaluation of muscle atrophy;</LI>
<LI>Yale Sensory Scale; and</LI>
<LI>VAS.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The authors measured the neurophysiological outcome by ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity in all participants but did not report the findings. All the evaluations were performed before treatment and at 12 months. The clinical outcome was assessed by a total score based on the results of the four outcome measures; however, no information was provided on the score generation process.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2014</LINK> (54 participants with 56 ulnar entrapments) compared endoscopic surgery with open decompression in people with clinical, neurophysiological, and ultrasonographic findings of ulnar neuropathy. The clinical outcome was measured by a modified Bishop scale, and the neurophysiological outcome by ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity. The trialists performed clinical and neurophysiological evaluations before surgery, during an early follow-up (a mean of 16 weeks), and a long-term follow-up (a mean of 16.8 months).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-vanVeen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">vanVeen 2015</LINK> (63 participants enrolled, 55 participants analysed) compared an ultrasound-guided injection of a 1 mL injection containing 40 mg methylprednisolone acetate and 10 mg lidocaine hydrochloride with a placebo injection. The trialists measured the clinical outcome by two subjective scales evaluating change in symptoms and severity of symptoms. Moreover, the trial authors evaluated the neurophysiological outcome by ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity and the utrasonographic outcome by measuring the ulnar nerve cross-section in a segment of 4 cm across the medial epicondyle.</P>

<P>We excluded two studies from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK> compared two groups of participants. In the first group, participants "were immobilized with the plaster slab for an external fixation for 3 weeks" after operation; in the second group, they "began an immediate range of motion on the 2nd day after operation". It seems that both groups were comprised of participants who underwent ulnar neurolysis or nerve anterior transposition. We excluded the study because the authors did not compare different therapeutic approaches, but rather two management approaches after surgery. From the translation it was difficult to evaluate the quality of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2011</LINK> compared two groups of participants treated surgically. Participants in the first group were treated with subcutaneous transposition, and in the second group with submuscular transposition. The main outcome measures were the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the ulnar nerve at the elbow and neurophysiological parameters. The authors concluded that submuscular transposition produced greater improvement than subcutaneous transposition in severe cases. The preoperative values of CSA and of neurophysiological parameters were identical for the two compared groups in the report (even the same decimal values); since this is statistically improbable, we had serious concerns about the methodological quality of the work and therefore excluded it.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Participants who underwent surgical procedures in the included studies had, in the majority of cases, improved symptoms and nerve function, but there were no studies comparing surgical treatment to conservative management to support this in a controlled trial environment.  </P>
<P>The available evidence suggests that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in the treatment of the clinical and neurophysiological impairment of the ulnar nerve. Transposition is associated with a greater possibility of deep wound infections. In 2005, Bartels and colleagues performed a cost analysis in the Netherlands and found that the total median costs per patient were EUR 1124 for simple decompression and EUR 2730 for anterior subcutaneous transposition. This difference was mainly due to the costs related to sick leave, which was shorter for simple decompression (<LINK REF="REF-Bartels-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartels 2005b</LINK>). In 2012, Song and colleagues performed a cost analysis and compared simple decompression, anterior subcutaneous transposition, anterior submuscular transposition, and medial epicondylectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2012</LINK>). They found that simple decompression yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of less than USD 2027 per quality-adjusted life-year, and as a result was the most cost-effective treatment. Endoscopic and open decompression are equally effective in improving clinical function, but a significantly higher rate of postoperative haematoma occurred with the endoscopic approach.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In clinically mild or moderate UNE, instructions to avoid movements or positions provoking the symptoms were sufficient to improve subjective discomfort, but the quality of the evidence was very poor (some bias, small numbers, electrophysiologically unconfirmed UNE in most cases, dropouts). Corticosteroid injection does not improve symptoms of UNE.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The available evidence is insufficient to identify the best treatment based on clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We did not think there was enough evidence to justify a multiple-treatment meta-analysis. Only two RCTs were available on the effectiveness of conservative treatments, and in one of these studies only 24% of participants had neurophysiological evidence of UNE. No RCT compared a surgically treated UNE group and an untreated or conservatively treated group. Currently, the most common practice is to treat patients with mild symptoms and without muscular weakness conservatively, while surgery is reserved for cases that do not show benefit after conservative treatments or with severe neurological symptoms and signs (persistent paraesthesia, objective motor weakness, or muscular atrophy). Our meta-analysis suggests that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in people with severe UNE, but simple decompression is associated with a lower rate of complications (wound infections and scar area sensory loss) than decompression with transposition. Not all studies measured adverse events.</P>
<P>No evidence was available on the effects of surgery on quality of life and imaging characteristics of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>None of the studies identified and included in our meta-analysis was at an overall high risk of bias. All were small. All the studies were RCTs, which permitted evaluation of a group of participants with clinical and electrophysiological evidence of ulnar nerve impairment who were sufficiently representative of the UNE population. All degrees of severity of nerve impairment were considered, and the number of participants was high (261 participants for the clinical outcomes and 101 participants for the neurophysiological outcome). The follow-up rate was very high (only eight participants were lost to follow-up). The method used to generate the allocation sequence was adequate in three of the four RCTs included in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>We observed no significant heterogeneity among studies, which allowed good precision of the estimated intervention effect. Some methodological problems must be highlighted. The four most important methodological weaknesses were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>an unblinded observer in one study (in two studies it was unclear whether the examiner was blinded);</LI>
<LI>inadequate sequence generation and unclear allocation concealment method in one study;</LI>
<LI>unclear allocation concealment method in two studies; and</LI>
<LI>no clear definition of the hypothesis being tested in all the studies.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Moreover, in all seven trials the authors neither specified whether the study was designed to be a non-inferiority or a superiority trial, nor did they calculate sample size.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We believe the present review has a low likelihood of language or location bias. Indeed, we searched in different databases without any language limitations. We obtained translations of articles written in languages other than English. We cannot exclude publication bias due to a higher rate of publication among studies with statistically significant effects, or time lag bias due to research findings published after our analysis of the literature.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In a previous review on the surgical treatment of UNE (<LINK REF="REF-Zlowodzki-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlowodzki 2007</LINK>), the authors identified the same RCTs that we included in our meta-analysis up to that point. However, the authors used a different statistical approach. Zlowodzki and colleagues analysed the clinical scores as continuous variables and, because different scoring systems were used in each study, they applied a conversion of effect sizes (standardised mean difference). In accordance with our protocol, we dichotomised the primary outcome measure into improvement or no improvement, regardless of differences between the tools used. Despite the difference in statistical evaluation, Zlowodzki and colleagues concluded that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective. In their review, two different and not entirely comparable surgical techniques (submuscular and subcutaneous transposition) were considered together in the meta-analysis. We also performed a meta-analysis comparing submuscular transposition and simple decompression, and found no difference between the procedures. Macadam and colleagues used a similar approach in their review, but the they also introduced non-randomised trials into the meta-analysis, with a higher likelihood of selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Macadam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macadam 2008</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The available evidence is insufficient to identify the best treatment for idiopathic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with UNE conservatively or surgically. However, the results of our meta-analysis provide moderate-quality evidence that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe, but decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. In mild cases, evidence from one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that providing information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Future research in this area should include RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of conservative treatments. These RCTs should use validated disease-specific clinical outcome measures, validated patient-oriented tools, neurophysiological measurements, and neuroimaging. Participants with homogeneous inclusion characteristics need to be included to adequately power the study.</P>
<P>An effort should be made to improve the methodology of RCTs examining surgical treatments. The most important aspects to include in future RCTs are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the presence of a blinded examiner;</LI>
<LI>a clear description of the allocation concealment method;</LI>
<LI>validated disease-specific clinical outcome measures; and</LI>
<LI>a definition of the hypothesis the study is testing (is the study designed to be a non-inferiority or a superiority trial?).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Moreover, there is a need for a trial comparing conservative and surgical treatment.</P>
