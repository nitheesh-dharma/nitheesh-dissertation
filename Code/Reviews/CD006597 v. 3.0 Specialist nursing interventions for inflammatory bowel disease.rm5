<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-06-11 08:37:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The number and type of gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease specialist nurses is increasing, along with the variety of roles performed in patient care and management. This review included one low quality trial of a specialist nurse counselling intervention compared with routine outpatient clinic follow up. No data were reported on remission outcomes. Counselling by a specialist nurse might improve mental health related quality of life for some IBD patients in the short term. However, the poor quality of the one included study does not allow for any definitive conclusions regarding the impact of the nurse-led counselling program. Better designed studies are needed to assess the impact of specialist nursing interventions on the care and management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The number, type and roles of specialist nurses dedicated to the care and management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is increasing. Despite this increase, there has been little evidence to date to demonstrate the effectiveness of specialist nursing interventions. This review aims to identify and evaluate the impact of specialist nursing interventions on management of inflammatory bowel disease, access to treatment, remission, morbidity and quality of life.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:48:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>A comprehensive search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and British Nursing Index was carried out to identify trials. References from relevant papers were searched and hand searching was undertaken of relevant publications including gastroenterology conference proceedings to identify additional trials (date of last search 30 September 2008).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-06-11 08:32:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies of gastroenterology and IBD specialist nurses intending to improve access and outcomes for patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-06-11 08:35:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:08:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>One randomised controlled trial of 100 IBD patients receiving a specialist nurse delivered counselling package (n = 50) or routine outpatient clinic follow-up (n = 50), with assessments at entry and six and 12 months, was included in this review. This study was of low methodological quality. Disease remission, patient compliance, clinical improvement, utilisation of nurse-led services, patient satisfaction, hospital admission, outpatient attendance, progression to surgery, length of hospital stay and cost effectiveness data were not reported. Pooled mean mental health scores at 6 months were higher in patients who received nurse-led counselling compared to patients who received routine follow-up. However, this difference was not statistically significant (WMD 3.67; 95% CI -0.44 to 7.77; P = 0.08). Other pooled assessments of physical and psychological well-being showed no statistically significant differences. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-11 08:36:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although specialist nurse counselling interventions might provide benefit for IBD patients the one included study was of low quality and the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. Higher quality trials of gastroenterology and IBD specialist nursing interventions are needed to assess the impact of specialist nursing interventions on the care and management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-12 08:13:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a term used to describe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, both of which are chronic, lifelong conditions characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission. The cause or causes of either illness have not yet been identified, however, both genetic factors and environmental triggers are likely to be involved (<LINK REF="REF-NACC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NACC 2005</LINK>). There is a higher incidence of both diseases in the UK, northern Europe and North America compared to central and southern Europe, Asia and the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Loftus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loftus 2004</LINK>). The severity of symptoms fluctuates unpredictably over time with patients likely to experience flare-ups in between intervals of remission or reduced symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-NACC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NACC 2005</LINK>). The treatment of both conditions involves medical management, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgical interventions may also be necessary.</P>
<P>The past decade has seen the emergence of specialist nurses in gastroenterology many of whom have increasingly been involved in managing the care of patients with a variety of conditions in collaboration with their medical colleagues. An advanced level of nurse practitioner has been defined as, "a registered nurse who has acquired the expert knowledge base, complex skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice, the characteristics of which are shaped by the context and/or country in which s/he is credentialed to practice. A Masters degree is recommended for entry level (<LINK REF="REF-ICN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICN 2005</LINK>)." In addition, specialist nurses perform a diverse range of roles and functions perceived as beneficial by IBD patients, including clinic and medication management, patient education, information, counselling, advocacy, help lines and research (<LINK REF="REF-Belling-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belling 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>As the number and type of nurse specialists dedicated to the care and management of patients with IBD is increasing, evidence pertaining to their effectiveness and scope of practice, which explore the strengths and weaknesses of different service models, as well as general efficacy, is needed.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-06-12 08:13:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>STUDY SELECTION<BR/>Two authors (LW, RB) independently examined titles and abstracts generated using the search strategy to determine eligibility based on the inclusion criteria specified above. Where information provided was unclear or insufficient to determine eligibility, the full text of the paper or study was retrieved and scrutinised independently by the two authors. Any studies that did not involve a specialist nurse or advanced nurse practitioner role were excluded at this stage. Any disagreement between the authors was resolved by consensus without recourse to a third reviewer (SM). The full text of papers identified as relevant at this stage were then obtained. Selected studies were checked to ensure duplicate data from more than one report of an individual study were not used. Excluded studies and reasons for exclusion were recorded.</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>Two authors (RB, SM) independently evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. The methodological quality of included trials was documented in terms of the method of randomisation, concealment of allocation and blinding of outcome assessors. The methodological quality of cohort and case control studies was to be assessed using the Downs and Black scale (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). Quasi experimental studies (controlled before-after or interrupted time series) were to be quality assessed using the EPOC quality criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>). Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>). Disagreements were negotiated with a third reviewer (LW).</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into the following three categories (see Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A: All quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B: One or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C: One or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Two authors (LW, RB) independently extracted data from the retrieved studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement between the authors was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Data concerning details of the study population, the intervention and outcomes were extracted using a data extraction form, which included the following information:<BR/>1. General information: title, authors, source, contact address, country, setting (hospital or community based), publication language, sponsoring, published/unpublished.<BR/>2. Study method(s): design, randomisation (and method), allocation concealment, duration.<BR/>3. Intervention(s): nature of intervention (including nurse role), duration, length of follow up.<BR/>4. Participants: sampling, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, numbers, gender, age, ethnicity, baseline measurements (for example blood test results), numbers withdrawing from study, losses to follow up, any subgroups (for example Crohn's or colitis).<BR/>5. Outcomes: as specified in this review's inclusion criteria, how outcomes were assessed, duration of follow up, quality of reporting of outcomes.<BR/>6. Results: for outcomes as specified, intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Where necessary, authors were contacted about missing or unclear information in their trials.</P>
<P>ELECTRONIC SEARCHES<BR/>Journals at Ovid Essential Nursing Collection was not searched as journals duplicated those covered by Medline, CINAHL, British Nursing Index and ScienceDirect.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-06-11 11:49:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>STUDIES IDENTIFIED<BR/>Electronic searches up to 30 September 2008 identified 5099 citations with abstracts. Three potentially relevant studies were identified. Full papers were retrieved for these three studies and independently assessed for inclusion by two authors (LW and RB). No further studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified from hand searching. 
</P>
<P>INTERRATER AGREEMENT<BR/>There were no disagreements on inclusion between the two reviewers.</P>
<P>MISSING DATA<BR/>The corresponding author for <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> was contacted to clarify details of the reported trial.</P>
<P>EXCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>The majority of citations initially identified were excluded because they did not describe or involve interventions by specialist nurses. Of the two excluded studies that did specify a specialist nursing intervention, neither reported control groups. Reasons for excluding studies are given in the characteristics of excluded studies table.</P>
<P>INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria. A full paper of the reported study was acquired and used to extract data. Methodological quality was assessed using the full paper.</P>
<P>STUDY DESIGN<BR/>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>) was a randomised controlled trial of 12 months duration. The reported aim of this study was to examine the effects of a nurse-led counselling service on health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS<BR/>One hundred patients with inflammatory bowel disease took part in the included trial; 50 with long-standing ulcerative colitis, and 50 with Crohn's disease. Gender was distributed unequally between patient groups. Of those with ulcerative colitis, 22 were females. Of those with Crohn's disease, 33 were females. Ages ranged from 17 to 68 years (median 28 years) in those with ulcerative colitis and from 17 to 66 years (median 27 years) in the Crohn's patients. Patients were recruited from a single gastroenterology clinic in a UK general hospital setting.</P>
<P>Diagnosis of IBD in the included study was confirmed in ulcerative colitis patients by rectal biopsy and sigmoidoscopy and in Crohn's disease patients by radiological and endoscopic features. Duration of disease ranged from 6 months to 29 years, median 5 years (ulcerative colitis) and 6 months to 26 years, median 4.5 years (Crohn's disease).</P>
<P>INTERVENTIONS<BR/>Fifty IBD patients were randomised to receive a counselling package (25 with UC and 25 with Crohn's) and 50 IBD patients were randomised to routine follow-up in clinic.</P>
<P>The counselling intervention was provided by a trained IBD nurse counsellor. Specific information about IBD background and experience were not reported. In addition to counselling, the nurse provided general support to patients.</P>
<P>The counselling package consisted of information provision and a psychological intervention. Information was provided in the form of booklets and videos. Topics covered included physical symptoms, drug therapy, diet and surgery. The psychological intervention comprised a stress management programme of relaxation exercises and coping mechanisms, adapted for patients with IBD and implemented using a standardised protocol. The duration of the counselling intervention was 12 months. The total number of counselling sessions was patient determined (mean 3.25 sessions over the one year study period). IBD patients randomised to routine follow-up in clinics were provided with information booklets on request, had their questions on disease answered and received consultations at baseline, three, six and 12 months. Routine follow-up patients were made aware of local patient support groups. No additional psychological support was provided to routine follow-up patients. </P>
<P>OUTCOME MEASURES<BR/>Physical assessment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease activity in <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> was based on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Best-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Best 1976</LINK>). Health related quality of life was measured using the SF-36 Short Form (<LINK REF="REF-Brazier-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazier 1992</LINK>) measuring eight dimensions of physical and psychological well-being. Psychological assessment was conducted using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) (<LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>) and coping strategies using the Styles and Strategies Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Roger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roger 1993</LINK>). With the exception of the Styles and Strategies Questionnaire all of these instruments have established reliability and validity for IBD patients. In addition, population norms have been established for SF-36.</P>
<P>Health-related quality of life, physical and psychological measurements were made after randomisation of IBD patients and subsequently at six and 12 monthly intervals. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-06-11 11:50:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The included randomised controlled trial was classified as having a high risk of bias, with one or more quality criteria not met or undetermined. Inter-rater agreement of trial quality was 0.842. Agreement was reached following discussion without recourse to a third reviewer (LW).</P>
<P>MINIMISATION OF SELECTION BIAS<BR/>Although patient recruitment was sequential from a single gastroenterology clinic, randomisation methods were not described. It is unclear whether allocation to intervention groups was concealed or whether the clinic from which patients were recruited was the only one in existence within the hospital setting. Study groups were not comparable at baseline on the basis of disease activity (modified CDAI) also suggesting selection bias.</P>
<P>MINIMISATION OF ATTRITION BIAS<BR/>No attrition from the study occurred. No losses to follow-up were reported.</P>
<P>MINIMISATION OF DETECTION BIAS<BR/>Details of blinding of outcome assessors were not described. Patients were not blinded. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:08:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> study did not report on the following outcomes: induction and maintenance of remission, patient compliance or adherence, clinical improvement, duration of remission, utilisation of nurse-led services, patient satisfaction, hospital admission, outpatient attendance, progression to surgery, length of hospital stay, and cost effectiveness. Modified mean CDAI scores were significantly different in the treatment and control group with ulcerative colitis at baseline (intervention 96.3 [S.D. 50.1], control 85.8 [S.D. 50.7], P = &lt; 0.05); thus these groups were not comparable after randomisation.</P>
<P>PSYCHO-SOCIAL WELL BEING AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE<BR/>Mental health scores at 6 months for both Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis were higher in patients who received nurse-led counselling compared to patients who received routine follow up.  However, these differences were not statistically significant (Crohn&#8217;s WMD 3.50; 95% CI -2.66 to 9.66; P = 0.27; ulcerative colitis WMD 3.80; 95% CI - 1.71 to 9.31; P = 0.18; See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Pooled mean mental health scores at 6 months were higher in patients who received nurse-led counselling compared to patients who received routine follow-up. Again, this difference was not statistically significant (WMD 3.67; 95% CI -0.44 to 7.77; P = 0.08; See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled mean mental health scores at 12 months (WMD 0.17; 95% CI -4.05 to 4.38; P = 0.94; See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). </P>
<P>At baseline, mean HAD scores for anxiety were significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients than all other groups (P &lt; 0.01). These returned to normal over time in both counselled and routinely followed up patients. There were no statistically significant differences in mean HAD anxiety scores between the counselling or control groups at 6 months (WMD -0.49; 95% CI -1.94 to 0.96; P = 0.51) or 12 months (WMD -1.21; 95% CI -2.65 to 0.23; P = 0.10). </P>
<P>HAD scores for depression remained normal in all groups throughout the study and there were no statistically significant differences between counselling and control groups at 6 (WMD 0.18; 95% CI -1.10 to 1.47; P = 0.78) or 12 months (WMD 0.04; 95% CI -1.25 to 1.34; P = 0.95). </P>
<P>Maladaptive coping strategies present at baseline in Crohn's disease patients declined significantly at six months returning to normal levels. There were no statistically significant differences between the counselling and control groups in emotional, avoidance or maladaptive coping strategies at 6 or 12 months. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:00:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>This systematic review describes a single randomised controlled trial studying the impact of a specialist nurse-led counselling service on quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. No evidence was presented regarding remission data, the main outcome measure for this review. However, results were presented regarding the impact of nurse-led counselling on health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>Pooled mean mental health scores at 6 months were higher in patients who received nurse-led counselling compared to patients who received routine follow-up. However, this difference was not statistically significant (WMD 3.67; 95% CI -0.44 to 7.77; P = 0.08). Other pooled assessments of physical and psychological well-being showed no statistically significant differences. Unfortunately, the high risk of bias in this study, particularly through participant selection, small sample size, low statistical power, and selective reporting of results limit what can be inferred.</P>
<P>In general the lack of controlled trials reported in this area was disappointing. At least one of the excluded studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nightingale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nightingale 2000</LINK>) sought to measure and report the impact of nurse-led interventions on patients in remission, but without controls generalisability of findings is too severely limited to determine.</P>
<P>The one included study has a number of methodological limitations. Although the sample size in the included study was determined using power analysis, based on a medium effect size, the necessary sample size was not achieved. Therefore, study power was probably not sufficient to demonstrate statistically significant changes in the parameters measured. Patients with ulcerative colitis who received nurse-led counselling or routine follow-up were not comparable at baseline on the basis of modified CDAI scores suggesting selection bias. The failure to demonstrate significant differences between counselling and routine follow-up groups may have been attributable to greater attention received from medical and nursing staff in the routine follow-up group, for example through questionnaire completion. The authors did not report whether the nursing staff providing routine follow-up were specialist nurses.  If specialist nurses did provide routine follow-up, then it might be argued that the study did not compare specialist nurses with non-specialist nurses, but counselling with normal care. Taking part in the study may also have increased information seeking behaviours. The stress management programme itself may have been inappropriate for use with IBD patients since it had previously been validated in patients with occupational rather than health-related stress. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's patients in this study had been diagnosed with their conditions for several years prior to commencement of the study (duration of disease ranged from 6 months to 29 years, median 5.5 years) and the possibility cannot be discounted that these patients may have received information and advice on managing stress before entering the study.</P>
<P>The roles of specialist and advanced practice nurses vary considerably in both scope and complexity (<LINK REF="REF-NMC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NMC 2007</LINK>) as do the range of interventions such nurses offer to patients with IBD (<LINK REF="REF-NACC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NACC 2005</LINK>). While the provision of information and advice by specialist nurses is clearly welcomed and valued by many patients (<LINK REF="REF-Belling-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belling 2008</LINK>), the only trial meeting the inclusion criteria reflects only one form of intervention from this broader spectrum of interventions specialist nurses can and do provide.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:00:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although specialist nurse counselling interventions might provide benefit for IBD patients the one included study was of low quality and the results should be interpreted with caution. The high risk of bias in the one included study makes it problematic to draw reliable practice implications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-06-11 13:00:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The general lack of trials of interventions by specialist gastroenterology and IBD nurses was notable. Further research is clearly needed to assess the impact of specialist nursing interventions on the care and management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Methodologically rigorous randomised controlled trials should assess health-related quality of life, nursing leadership, disease management, management of clinics, provision of help lines, patient education and advocacy.</P>
