<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Many people who have a traumatic brain injury experience apathy. Apathy is a decrease in cognitive, behavioural and emotional components of goal-directed activity due to reduced motivation. It is characterised by lessened activity, initiative and concern about working towards and achieving goals. This problem impacts on rehabilitation outcome, independence, work and family burden.</P>
<P>The review authors searched the literature for treatment studies of apathy, or a component of apathy, in people who have had a traumatic brain injury. One randomised controlled trial was found which examined the use of cranial electrotherapy stimulation for inertia, which is a component of apathy. Evidence for the effectiveness of this treatment is particularly restricted by the small number of participants and the lack of statistical analyses to demonstrate that the cranial electrotherapy stimulation treatment was more successful than sham or no treatment. More methodologically rigorous studies need to be conducted to investigate different methods of effectively treating apathy in people with traumatic brain injury.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-12 23:27:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apathy is a deficiency in overt behavioural, emotional and cognitive components of goal-directed behaviour. It is a common occurrence after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with widespread impact. We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for apathy in the TBI population.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-09-15 10:52:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To investigate the effectiveness of interventions for apathy in adults who have sustained a TBI. This was evaluated by changes in behavioural, cognitive and emotional measures of apathy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-09 16:37:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the following databases up to January 2008: CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, Issue 1), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE (1950 to Jan 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2008), PsycINFO (1806 to Jan 2008), CINAHL (1982 Jan 2008), PsycBITE, AMED (1985 to Jan 2008), www.controlled-trials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.actr.org.au.The Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register was searched to Jan 2009. Additionally, we examined key conference proceedings and reference lists of included trials to identify further studies meeting the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions specifically targeting apathy for people with TBI.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-09 16:37:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors (ALB and RLT) independently assessed studies for inclusion. We rated the methodological quality of included studies and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:16:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We identified one trial that satisfied the inclusion criteria for this review. This trial (N = 21) showed that cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) decreased inertia, which is a component of apathy, while no changes were seen in the sham treatment or no treatment control groups. Given that no between-group analysis was reported, it was not possible to determine if the CES treatment group improved significantly more than the control group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:17:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>No evidence was provided to support the use of CES treatment for inertia, a component of apathy. Between-group statistical analyses were not conducted and it was therefore not possible to determine the efficacy of the treatment relative to no treatment or sham treatment. Results regarding the effectiveness of treatment can only be inferred, and this evidence is based on only one trial with a small sample size. More randomised controlled trials evaluating different ways of treating apathy would be valuable. Trials should have larger sample sizes and use rigorous research designs and statistical analyses appropriate for examining between-group differences.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:19:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-01-13 07:12:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apathy is one of the disorders of diminished motivation (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005</LINK>) and is defined as a deficiency in overt behavioural, emotional and cognitive components of goal-directed behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1996</LINK>). This includes deficits in one or all components leading to a goal. Elements of goal-directed behaviour include: a) creation of an intention, b) formation of a plan, c) organisation of behaviour, d) programme of action, including initiation and sustaining activity, e) inspection of performance, f) regulation of behaviour to match the plan, and g) verification of conscious activity and results (<LINK REF="REF-Luria-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luria 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically, the essential feature of apathy is a decrease in goal-directed activity due to reduced motivation (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1996</LINK>). It sits on the continuum of disorders of decreased motivation, with apathy at the end of lesser severity, ranging through abulia (poverty of behaviour and speech) (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005b</LINK>) to akinetic mutism (total absence of speech or movement in the presence of visual tracking) (<LINK REF="REF-American-Congress-of-Rehabilitation-Medicine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine 1995</LINK>) at the most severe end. Apathy is distinguished from abulia by degree of impairment. Apathy is characterised by impaired initiation, activity and diminished concern, generally with intact communication (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005</LINK>). Abulia is characterised by lack of initiation, self-regulation of purposeful behaviour and concern, in conjunction with severely impaired ability to communicate (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1990</LINK>). Apathy is also distinguished from other causes of decreases in goal-directed activity, including diminished level of consciousness, severe intellectual impairment or emotional distress (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1990</LINK>) such as depression (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1998</LINK>). Apathy can be considered as a syndrome consisting of impaired goal-directed behaviour, cognition and emotion, or divided into elements of apathy, such as diminished initiative, time spent in activities or flat affect.</P>
<P>Apathy is a common occurrence after neurological damage. Following traumatic brain injury (TBI) it is reported in 71% of individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Kant-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 1998</LINK>). The impact of apathy is widespread, hampering physical rehabilitation, coping skills (<LINK REF="REF-Finset-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finset 2000</LINK>), vocational outcome, independence in the home (<LINK REF="REF-Prigatano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prigatano 1992</LINK>), and increasing family burden (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:19:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Interventions utilised in the rehabilitation of apathy range from pharmacological to psychological therapy. Pharmacological interventions for apathy often involve treating participants with dopamine agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Kant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 2002</LINK>). There are reports suggesting that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (<LINK REF="STD-Tenovuo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tenovuo 2005</LINK>) and psychostimulants (<LINK REF="REF-Deb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newburn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newburn 2005</LINK>) are also effective in the pharmacological treatment of apathy.</P>
<P>Psychological interventions generally incorporate behavioural or cognitive rehabilitation strategies, or both. They may utilise techniques found in problem solving therapy (for example, <LINK REF="STD-von-Cramon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">von Cramon 1991</LINK>). Problem solving therapy incorporates strategies to assist with goal-directed activity, such as planning of stages, and executing and monitoring of activity (<LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 1997</LINK>). Cognitive interventions, such as external compensation via checklists and paging systems have been shown to increase initiation towards goal-directed activity (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Behavioural therapies have also been observed to reduce apathy. For example, activity therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Politis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Politis 2004</LINK>), multisensory environments (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>) and music therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Purdie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purdie 1997</LINK>) have been shown to reduce apathy in neurological populations. Goal-setting therapy is another type of behavioural intervention that can assist in the rehabilitation of apathy. By definition this type of therapy aims to improve goal-directed activity. This technique is commonly used in rehabilitation centres because it allows treatment to be targeted to individual needs and success to be easily measured (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McMillan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMillan 1999</LINK> describes the process of goal-setting in a neurological population where 78% of their sample achieved long-term goals, indicating goal-directed activity was successfully accomplished.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given that apathy is so common following TBI, with widespread functional consequences, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions available. To the best of our knowledge there is no published systematic review examining interventions for apathy after TBI.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-09 16:38:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for apathy following TBI. Interventions for apathy were compared to no intervention. A secondary objective was to compare different types of interventions, such as pharmacological and psychological, to establish the most effective method for decreasing apathy. Additionally, the occurrence of adverse events was investigated to assist practitioners in making informed choices about interventions used.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-02-09 16:40:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This review included trials of participants of either sex who sustained a TBI after the age of five years. People who sustained a TBI before age five were excluded due to the confound of brain maturation issues.</P>
<P>A TBI is defined as a physiological disruption to normal brain function that has been caused by a traumatic event (such as a blow to the head or a sudden acceleration/deceleration movement). This disruption must result in at least one of the following: a) loss of consciousness, b) alteration of mental state at the time of the injury, c) loss of memory immediately before or after the impact, or d) focal neurological deficits that may or may not be transient (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1993</LINK>). All degrees of severity of injury were included, as defined by length of post-traumatic amnesia, Glasgow Coma Scale score, medical imaging or other standard measure of severity.</P>
<P>This review included trials that investigated interventions targeting apathy. Trials were excluded if the deficit was not the result of the TBI, and thus apathy occurred because of depression, dementia, delirium, stroke or other health conditions were not included. If the trial consisted of a mixed brain injury population, it was included if data for the TBI group were reported separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-12 14:18:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Any type of intervention aimed at treating apathy was included. Interventions may have included any psychological, pharmacological or physical therapy. There was no restriction on duration or frequency of intervention. Studies focusing on apathy or any element(s) of apathy were included (for example, cognitive, behavioural or emotional components). We included studies that included individuals who were concurrently taking medications for medical and psychological illnesses (for example, antidepressant or antiepileptic drugs). If and when more studies are identified in the future, types of interventions will be compared against each other and no intervention.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:23:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Types of outcome measures included in this review were neuropsychological tests, psychological tests, behavioural observation, self or observer report, psychological rating scales and questionnaires.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome measures were measures of behavioural, emotional and cognitive components of apathy. Behavioural components of apathy refer to the person&#8217;s engagement and performance in activities. Measures assess the following: activity, activity level, responsiveness to stimuli, effort and level of engagement in a given activity, productivity, appropriate cessation of activity and social withdrawal. Cognitive components investigated for change include initiation, ability to sustain behaviour, ability to stay on task and ability to generate material. Emotional components that were investigated for change include indifference, lack of concern and flattened affect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Outcome measures of everyday functioning, participation levels (in community settings, rehabilitation settings, activities of daily living and other activities such as hobbies), psychosocial functioning, general aspects of cognition, general aspects of mood and affect, treatment compliance and service usage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were recorded and classified as increased psychological distress, physical adverse outcomes (such as side effects of medication and medical difficulties resulting from increased activity) and other.</P>

<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK>) is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) for males with traumatic closed head injuries living in a sheltered living facility. CES treatment (N = 10) was compared to a sham treatment control (N = 5) and a no treatment control (N = 6). The primary outcome measure was the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The five factors of the POMS were measured as follows: fatigue/inertia, tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility and confusion/bewilderment. This study met the criteria for inclusion because it measured the effect of treatment on inertia, a behavioural element of apathy.

<P>This study sought an alternative to pharmacological treatment and therefore examined cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES). CES was investigated as a method of intervention for closed-head injury patients residing in a sheltered living facility. Participants were randomised into three groups: CES, a sham treatment control and a no treatment control. Statistical analysis to investigate similarity between groups at baseline was not reported. Post-treatment results indicated that the CES group showed a statistically significant improvement in all five factors of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), including fatigue/inertia. The fatigue/inertia domain scale reported a mean decrease from 7.44 to 5.33 (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). No statistically significant changes were found in either the sham treatment or no treatment control groups. Given that between-group statistical analysis was not reported, it was not possible to determine if the CES group improved significantly more than the control groups. A follow-up assessment was not conducted, so evidence for maintenance of improvements is unknown. Number of seizures, a possible adverse event, was recorded during treatment. There was no increase in seizure numbers due to CES. No other adverse events were reported.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-09 16:42:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The aim of this review was to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for apathy following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Only one trial met the criteria for inclusion: the <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK> trial, therefore data could not be pooled for further analysis or interpretation. The <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK> article described results supporting decreases over time in inertia, an element of apathy, with cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment. Sham treatment and no treatment control groups did not show improvements in inertia over time. Given that the study did not report results of between-group statistical analyses, it was not possible to ascertain if the CES group improved significantly more than the control groups. Thus, whether CES treatment improves inertia more than the control treatments is unknown.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-01-12 14:44:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given that only one trial met criteria for this review, there is not robust evidence on which to base practice. This strongly suggests a need for further methodologically rigorous investigations. In the meantime, additional ideas about treatment options could be gained from reviewing trials that investigated interventions for apathy, but did not meet the criteria for this review. A number of trials were found that reported treatments for apathy, or an element of apathy, in the human neurological population. However, they were excluded because they either considered neurological populations other than the TBI population or were not a randomised controlled trial (RCT). These 20 excluded studies are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table. Half of these papers were studies of pharmacological interventions treating components of apathy in the dementia population. There were few studies that treated apathy as a syndrome, instead these trials treated an element of apathy. Only one non-pharmacological randomised controlled trial treated the apathy syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Politis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Politis 2004</LINK>). This trial examined a kit-based activity intervention compared to a time and attention control and found both therapies significantly decreased apathy in the dementia population. In the TBI population there was only one trial that treated the syndrome of apathy rather than a component of apathy (<LINK REF="STD-Newburn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newburn 2005</LINK>). This series of case studies examined the effect of selegiline, a dopamine agent, on the apathy syndrome.</P>
<P>In order to review the applicability of the evidence included in this review, we considered the sample size and clinical characteristics of the participants. The sample size was small, with only 21 participants over three groups. This suggests that the study may not have adequate power. Although all participants were said to have sustained a closed head injury, the report indicated a number of additional injuries such as gas poisoning and cerebral carcinoma. Findings of this review must be viewed in light of, inter alia, the small size and heterogenous characteristics of the sample.</P>
<P>When assessing the evidence, variability within the literature about the term apathy should be considered. First, there is a lack of consistency in the use of terminology in the literature. Some papers use the term apathy (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Politis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Politis 2004</LINK>), whilst others describe motivational deficits (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1996</LINK>) or an amotivational syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-van-Reekum-1995" TYPE="STUDY">van Reekum 1995</LINK>). Second, there is diversity in how apathy has been operationally defined in different trials. <LINK REF="REF-Marin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1991</LINK> defined an apathy syndrome that can be used to operationalise apathy. However, apathy is still described in a number of different ways. For example, it has been operationalised as engagement (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimmons-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimmons 2003</LINK>) or lack of self-initiated action (<LINK REF="REF-Stuss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuss 2000</LINK>). In order to compare treatments and their applicability accurately, standardised terminology and one operational definition is required.</P>
<P>When considering trials of treatments of apathy, difficulties in assessment should be taken into account. Particular difficulties apply to differential diagnosis through assessment. For example, although efforts have been made to develop a psychometrically sound measurement instrument that differentiates apathy from depression (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 1991b</LINK>), other authors argue that within the TBI population this distinction is not always possible (<LINK REF="REF-Glenn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenn 2002</LINK>). Assessment of apathy is further complicated by use of a number of omnibus measures that assess apathy along with a number of other physiological, cognitive and psychological factors, such as fatigue, disinhibition and depressed mood.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK>) is of moderate methodological quality, according to the PEDro scale. This indicates that the trial has taken measures to decrease bias. Furthermore, this trial was awarded PEDro points for items that are traditionally difficult to achieve for a non-pharmacological study (<LINK REF="REF-Perdices-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perdices 2006</LINK>). Namely, both participants and therapists remained blind to treatment group.</P>
<P>However, notwithstanding the moderate PEDro score, there are problems with the interpretation of the results because between-group statistical analyses were not reported. Thus, it is not possible to determine if the treatment group improved more than the control groups; it is only possible to ascertain whether the groups improved over time. Analyses were not undertaken to establish if the groups were similar at baseline, making it difficult to decipher whether changes after treatment were due to treatment effects, or if they were due to pre-treatment group differences. Furthermore, the authors did not state if allocation was concealed or whether participants received the treatment as allocated. An additional potential confound was that inertia was measured in the same variable as fatigue. Thus, the findings of this review must be viewed in light of the potential areas of confound and bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>As far as the authors are aware, there is not another systematic review on interventions for apathy. However, there are non-systematic reviews of treatment options available for apathy (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2007</LINK>). The use of CES treatment is not mentioned within this literature. Treatments described include both pharmacological and psychological methods. Pharmacological methods reported include dopamine agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The psychological methods discussed encompass behavioural interventions, cognitive rehabilitation and the use of external compensation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:26:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This review does not provide support for the effectiveness of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in the treatment of inertia, which is an element of apathy. This conclusion is based on a single trial with a small sample size (N = 21), which did not report results of between-group statistical analyses. More research is needed using larger sample sizes, and reporting between-group statistical analyses, to confirm these findings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-12 14:58:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The limited number of trials included in this review indicates that more controlled trials are required in this area. To allow for meta-analysis and pooling of data in the future, it is necessary for interventions to use either a standardised operational definition of apathy or treat comparable elements of apathy. This review indicates that this is an area of research which has not been examined with methodologically rigorous techniques. Despite the moderate number of trials examining treatments for apathy (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table) there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the traumatic brain injury (TBI) population examining treatment of the apathy syndrome, and only one trial investigating an element of apathy. Additional RCTs are needed, particularly considering the treatment of the apathy syndrome.</P>
<P>The included study must be viewed in the light of its small sample size. Future studies should aim to have larger numbers of participants. Finally, it would be useful to evaluate different types of treatment for the apathy syndrome.</P>
