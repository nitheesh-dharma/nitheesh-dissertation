<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 15:21:20 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been studied as an alternative strategy in the management of HIV-infected patients. STI involve planned, pre-specified cyclical interruptions in ART with an aim to alleviate treatment fatigue, provide possible immunological benefit, reduce drug toxicities and decrease costs of care. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence for use of STI as an alternative strategy in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection. STI is a planned, experimental intervention, and the evidence from 33 available intervention trials has been summarized. Currently, several large STI trials are underway, investigating long-term effects of STI strategies. Their results will be available in a few years. Based on the studies we reviewed, we find that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of STI as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although antiretroviral treatment (ART) has led to a decline in morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected patients in developed countries, it has also presented challenges. These challenges include increases in pill burden; adherence to treatment; development of resistance and treatment failure; development of drug toxicities; and increase in cost of HIV treatment and care. These issues stimulated interest in investigating the short-term and long-term consequences of discontinuing ART, thus providing support for research in structured treatment interruptions (STI). </P>
<P>Structured treatment interruptions of antiretroviral treatment involve taking supervised breaks from ART. STI are defined as one or more planned, timing pre-specified, cyclical interruptions in ART. STI are attempted in monitored clinical settings in eligible participants. STI have generated hopes of reducing drug toxicities, decreasing costs and total time on treatment in HIV-positive patients. The first STI was attempted in the case of a patient in Germany, who later permanently discontinued treatment. This successful anecdotal case report led to several trials on STI worldwide.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection, using all available high-quality studies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Nine databases covering the time period from January 1996 to March 2005 were searched. Bibliographies were scanned and experts contacted in the field to identify unpublished research and ongoing trials. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and evaluated study eligibility and quality. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with a third reviewer. Data from 33 studies were included in the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>STI is a planned, timing pre-specified experimental intervention. In our review, we decided to include all available intervention trials in HIV-infected patients, with or without control groups. We reviewed evidence from 18 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, and 15 single arm trials. Single arm trials were included because these pilot studies made significant contribution to the early development and refutation of hypotheses in STI.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials included in this review varied in study participants, methodology and reported inconsistent measures of effect. Due to this heterogeneity, we did not attempt to meta-analyse them. Results were tabulated and a qualitative systematic review was done</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>For the purpose of this review, STI strategies were classified either as a timed-cycle STI strategy or a CD4-guided STI strategy. </P>
<P>In timed-cycle STI strategy, a predetermined period of fixed duration (e.g. one week, one month) off ART was attempted followed by resumption of ART, while closely monitoring changes in CD4 levels and viral load levels. Predetermined criteria for interruption and resumption were laid out in this strategy. Timed-cycle STI fell out of favor due to reports of development of resistance in many studies. Moreover, there were no significant immunological and virological benefits, and no reduction in toxicities, reported in these studies. </P>
<P>In CD4-guided STI strategy, ART was interrupted for variable durations guided by CD4 levels. Participants with high nadir CD4 levels qualified for this approach. A reduction in costs of ART, a reduction in mutation, and a better tolerability of this CD4-guided STI strategy was reported. However, concerns about long-term safety of this strategy on immunological, virological, and clinical outcomes were also raised.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Timed-cycle STI have not been proven to be safe in the short term. Although CD4-guided STI strategy has reported favorable outcomes in the short term, the long-term safety, efficacy and tolerability of this strategy has not been fully investigated. Based on the studies we reviewed, the evidence to support the use of timed-cycle STI and CD4-guided STI cycles as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection is inconclusive.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>The introduction of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has led to a decline in morbidity and mortality of HIV infection in the developed world. (<LINK REF="REF-Flepp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flepp 2001</LINK>). However, long-term management with ART has presented challenges to patients and providers. These challenges include increased pill burden, adherence to medication, increase in ART toxicities, higher cost of HIV management (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschel-B-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschel B 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lori-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lori 2002</LINK>). Moreover, concerns about development of resistance, treatment failure and treatment fatigue have been raised by providers (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Blankson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankson 2001</LINK>). These concerns stimulated interest in understanding the short-term and long-term consequences of periodically discontinuing the use of antiretroviral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Dybul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dybul 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Havlir-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havlir 2002</LINK>). These intermittent, supervised, periodic breaks in ART have been termed "structured treatment interruptions," or STI (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lori-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lori 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>STI have been defined as "one or more planned, pre-specified, cyclical interruptions in ART," monitored by CD4 T-cell counts or HIV RNA levels. They have been attempted in eligible participants in controlled clinical trial settings.</P>
<P>Researchers have been investigating the effects of STI for several years (<LINK REF="REF-Ananworanich-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananworanich 2005</LINK>). The first success with STI was reported in 1999, in the case of a patient from Germany, in whom, on development of complications from ART, two sporadic interruptions were attempted (<LINK REF="REF-Lisziewicz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lisziewicz 1999</LINK>). This patient developed a strong antiviral HIV-1 specific immune response and subsequently discontinued treatment permanently. This early anecdotal successful case report lead to studies of STI in clinical settings worldwide.<BR/> <BR/>Larger controlled trials investigating STI are currently underway in different parts of the world. (e.g., BASTA, SMART, ISS-PART, TRIVICAN, DART, ANRS 0164; CTN 164, CTN173, CTN 167 (OPTIMA) CTN190 (SMART) ANRS 112, ANRS 100). In United States, NIAID is investigating effects of STI alone or in conjunction with immune-adjuvants (NCT00084032, NCT00100646, NCT0080106, NCT00035893, NCT00013663, NCT00001899, NCT00071890). The trial results are expected in a few years. In this context, the role of STI remains to be determined.</P>
<P>STI have been investigated in three distinct HIV patient populations: </P>
<P>i) acute HIV infection (primary HIV infection), <BR/>ii) chronic HIV infection with suppressed viremia (controlled HIV infection), <BR/>iii) chronic HIV infection with unsuppressed viremia (uncontrolled HIV infection or treatment failure or salvage therapy). </P>
<P>Patients in these three categories of HIV infection (primary HIV, chronic suppressed, chronic unsuppressed) differ immunologically, virologically, and clinically. Therefore, to assess the performance of STI in each category, each category was analyzed separately.</P>
<P>We have summarized the evidence of effects of STI in these three categories of HIV infection in three separate reviews. This is the first review in the series. Patients with chronic suppressed (controlled) HIV infection constitute the majority of patients in clinical practice in the developed world, and the evidence in this review will be of relevance to them. </P>
<P>
<B>Aims and objectives of STI </B>
<BR/>The aims of STI in chronic suppressed HIV infection are:<BR/>i) decrease in exposure to ART with an aim to reduce total time on treatment, and alleviate treatment fatigue;<BR/>ii) decrease in ART toxicity and adverse effects; <BR/>iii) maintenance of treatment efficacy and control of viral rebound on ART resumption;<BR/>iv) investigation of the "auto-immunization hypothesis," i.e. the repeated exposure to autologous virus during off-ART periods, with the hope of enhancement of immune response (<LINK REF="STD-Fagard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fagard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>
<B>Inclusion criteria<BR/>
</B>STI are planned interventions, in monitored settings. We included randomized controlled trials, and non-randomized controlled trials that compared patients on STI with participants on continuous ART. We also included non-randomized controlled trials and single arm intervention trials, because they contributed to the early developments in the field. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>Exclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>Studies investigating unplanned, unstructured treatment interruptions were excluded. (i.e. those with naturally occurring treatment interruptions, drug discontinuations due to drug safety and tolerability). Case reports, case series, editorials, reviews, expert opinions, newsletters, modelling studies, in-vitro studies, and animal studies were excluded. Non-English studies, abstracts, and letters were excluded due to lack of complete peer-reviewed information.</P>

<P>HIV-infected adults with chronic suppressed HIV infection</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>HIV-infected adults on continuous ART</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention strategies:</B>
<BR/>STI strategies were classified into two major categories:<BR/>i) Timed-cycle STI <BR/>ii) CD4-guided STI<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>i. Timed-cycle STI:</B>
<BR/>In this strategy, a timed-cycle STI (a predetermined timed period of fixed duration off ART) has been attempted, followed by resumption of ART. Timed-cycles have been guided by CD4 or viral load (VL) levels. ART is interrupted if CD4 levels are high (&gt;350 cells/ml) or if VL is undetectable (VL&lt;50 copies/ml). ART is resumed when CD4 levels fall (&lt;200 cells/ml) or VL rebounds (500-5000 copies/ml); or, if patients experience adverse effects and are unable to tolerate STI. Criteria for reintroduction of ART and STI duration have been clearly specified in these trials.</P>
<P>
<B>ii. CD4-guided cycle STI: <BR/>
</B>In this strategy, ART is interrupted for variable durations guided by HIV-specific CD4 levels. ART is interrupted when CD4 are high (&gt;350 cells/ml) and resumed if CD4 drops to low levels (&lt;200 cells/ml). Patients with high nadir CD4 400-500 cells/ml qualify for this approach. </P>
<P>
<B>Types of co-intervention<BR/>
</B>In some studies, co-interventions (e.g. immune adjuvants such as interleukin-1, hydroxyurea mycophenolate mofetil) were used in addition to STI.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Classification of study design</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>I. Randomized controlled trials</B>
<BR/>In randomized controlled trial settings, participants on STI were compared to participants on continuous ART, or alternative STI strategies were compared.</P>
<P>
<B>II. Non-randomized controlled trials </B>
<BR/>In non-randomized controlled trial settings, participants on STI were compared to participants on continuous ART.</P>
<P>
<B>III. Single arm intervention studies and uncontrolled trials</B> <BR/>In single arm trials, effects of STI were investigated in participants, with no comparison groups.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>

<B>Databases and sources</B>
<BR/>Nine databases were searched:<BR/>1) Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL)<BR/>2) MEDLINE<BR/>3) EMBASE<BR/>4) BIOSIS<BR/>5) Web of Science<BR/>6) AIDSLINE (via NLM Gateway)<BR/>7) ACTIS (AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service)<BR/>8) Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)<BR/>9) Proceedings and abstracts from AIDS conferences, global meetings (via NLM Gateway)</P>
<P>In addition, bibliographies of included studies and relevant review articles were searched. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify unpublished research and ongoing trials<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Strategy </B>
<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. For the first screen, 3186 potentially relevant articles were identified and screened; 1182 duplicate citations were excluded; 1139 citations were selected for further review. From these, we excluded 951 citations and studies for a variety of reasons (e.g., they were modelling studies, animal studies, case series, case reports, reviews, opinions, news items, or editorials). The remaining 188 articles were identified as relevant. Of these, 60 articles were excluded for several reasons (e.g. they were concerned with basic sciences, or were letters). In the third screen, 128 full-text articles were retrieved. Of these, 72 were excluded for several reasons (e.g. they were non-English-language studies or abstracts). A total of 56 articles were pooled in three categories of HIV infection (acute, chronic HIV suppressed, and chronic HIV unsuppressed). The final data abstraction for this review on chronic suppressed HIV infection was done on 33 studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study eligibility <BR/>In the first screen, two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and evaluated study eligibility. Reviewers were not blinded to the names of the authors, journals, and other publication details. Articles identified as relevant in the first screen were evaluated in greater detail in the second screen using full text reports. Trials meeting inclusion criteria were considered eligible for inclusion. </P>
<P>Qualitative review <BR/>Trials investigated different STI strategies in diverse patient populations worldwide with varying eligibility criteria. Reported outcomes varied across trials. Outcome reporting was inconsistent, with no reporting of measures of effect. Therefore, it was considered inappropriate to combine them together in a meta-analysis. Trial results were tabulated and the evidence was summarized qualitatively.</P>
<P>Data abstraction:<BR/>Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers (NPP, JPT), using a standardized data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus after consultation with a third reviewer (JL). The two reviewers also independently assessed the methodological quality of all the included trials. The inter-rater reliability was high (kappa=0.8)</P>
<P>Extracted data included information on study design, clinical setting, country, patient population, type of trial, eligibility criteria of participants, sample size for STI and control groups, STI strategy, duration and cycles, outcomes, and assessment of quality.</P>

<B>A. Timed-cycle STI:</B>
<BR/> <BR/>
<B>A. Category 1: Randomized controlled trials (refer to table of comparisons)</B>
<BR/>Seven trials were identified in this category. Study sample sizes varied from 12 to 53. Timed-cycle STI of one week to two months durations were attempted. Varied ART regimens for variable durations (6 months to 3 years) were used. Eligibility criteria varied across trials. (e.g. most commonly, age&gt;18 years, CD4 nadir &gt;400, VL&lt;50 cop/ml, no history of opportunistic infections or AIDS defining illness, no history of drug resistance) at baseline. Varying durations of follow up were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>A. Category 2: Non-randomized controlled trials (refer to table of comparisons)</B>
<BR/>Six trials were identified in this category. Study sample sizes ranged from 8-45 participants. Timed-cycle STI of two weeks to three months were attempted. Varying ART regimens for variable durations (exceeding 6 months) were used. Eligibility criteria varied across trials (e.g. undetectable VL at baseline, CD4&gt;350 cells/ml); varying durations of follow up (1 month to 2 months) were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>A. Category 3: Single arm/uncontrolled trials (refer to table of comparisons)</B>
<BR/>Fourteen trials were identified in this category. These early controlled trials were pilot studies with small study sample sizes ranging from 9-20. Timed-cycle STI of varying durations (1-2 months) were attempted. Variable ART durations (6 months to one year) and varying ART regimens were used. Eligibility criteria varied across trials. The largest trial in this category was the Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial (SSITT), with a sample size of 133, in which timed-cycle STI of "two weeks on and eight weeks off" were attempted. These pilot studies were seminal in generating evidence in the field, but were limited by the absence of comparison groups. The study findings were later replicated in large randomized controlled trials</P>

<B>B. CD4-guided STI:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>B. Category 1: Randomized controlled trials (refer to table of comparisons)</B>
<BR/>Four studies reporting on two trials, were identified in this category. Study sample sizes varied from 26 to 150. STI durations were guided by nadir CD4 levels (CD4&lt;400). ART durations varied from 6 months to 4.6 years. Various ART regimens were used (2NRTI + PI, 2NRTI, SQV+RTV, PI+NNRTI+NRTI) were used. Eligibility criteria varied across trials. </P>
<P>
<B>B. Category 2: Non-randomized controlled trials (refer to table of comparisons )</B>
<BR/>In this category, a cohort of participants was assembled at baseline. There was only one trial in this category with a sample size of 71. Two to four cycles of STI of variable durations were attempted. STI were guided by nadir CD4 (i.e. ART stopped when CD4&gt;500, reintroduced when CD4&lt;300); ART duration exceeded 36 months. Variable ART regimens were used. Eligibility criteria included both treatment naïve and treatment experienced participants. The total follow up duration was 28 months.</P>
<P>
<B>B. Category 3: Single arm/uncontrolled trials (refer table of comparisons) </B>
<BR/>The single trial in this category (<LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>) had a sample size of 105. Variable STI durations were attempted; median duration of STI was 114 weeks. ART duration at baseline exceeded 6 months. The objective of the study was to determine best predictors of STI pulse therapy in which "cycles of therapy followed by prolonged interruption" were studied.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials was assessed using two methods:<BR/>1. Jadad's scale, a validated quality assessment instrument <BR/>2. Cochrane method for adequacy of concealment of allocation.</P>
<P>We also referred to the Cochrane Handbook for assessing study quality.</P>
<P>On the Jadad scale, each study was critically appraised for the following criteria and a Jadad score was assigned. Each criterion was assigned a score of 1 on a total of 5 points. </P>
<P>The Jadad scale comprises the following criteria:<BR/>I. Was the study randomized? (1point)<BR/>a. If so, was allocation concealed? (1point)<BR/>II. Was the study double-blinded? (1 point)<BR/>a. If so, were outcome assessors blinded? (1 point)<BR/>III. Was there a complete description of withdrawals and dropouts? (1point)</P>
<P>Concealment of treatment allocation was assessed using the standard Cochrane criteria. Studies were graded based on the following criteria:</P>
<P>Grade A adequate: Centralized, sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, on site computer system allocation, pre-numbered or coded.<BR/>Grade B unclear: If methods were not adequately described<BR/>Grade C inadequate: If sequences such as consecutive series of patients, case record numbers, date of birth, date of admission were used<BR/>Grade D not used/not reported: If methods were not reported</P>

<P>In the timed STI cycle studies we reviewed, there was a pattern of decline in HIV-specific CD4 T-cells in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2000</LINK>). There was no evidence of significant immunological or virological benefit in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK>). Reports of resistance mutations were noticed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK>). There were no improvements in metabolic parameters, nor were there adverse effects in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK>). Only one study that used a co-intervention in addition to STI, i.e. containment of viral rebound and maintenance of stable CD4 during STI, reported different results (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK>). </P>

</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK> attempted a timed-cycle STI in 52 participants. STI cycles of 4 weeks off and 8 weeks on ART were attempted. Eligibility criteria of participants were CD4&gt;300 cells/ml, VL&lt;500 copies/ml. ART duration exceeded six months. As a result of the study, an increase in VL &gt;50 copies/ml was reported in 26% participants in the STI arm and 9% of participants in the control arm. There were no differences between the groups in HIV-specific immune responses (CD4 T-cell counts and CD8 T-cell counts) with no reports of auto-immunization benefit. Reports of resistance were present in 3 of 5 STI (60%) participants. In terms of changes in metabolic parameters, significant differences (p=0.04) in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels reported between groups at week 40, were lost at week 48, thus there were no reductions in adverse effects of ART.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2003</LINK> attempted a timed-cycle STI in 20 participants. Participants were randomized to a control (continuous ART arm) and an intervention (ART plus hydroxyurea arm) for 24 weeks followed by 5 timed STI cycles. Eligibility criteria of participants were CD4 &gt;500 copies/ml, VL&gt;10,000 copies/ml, and ART duration greater than 52 weeks. As a result of the interventions, VL&lt;5000 copies/ml was reported in 8/9 participants in the intervention arm, and 4 of 10 participants in the control arm. The intervention arm reported a better control of viral load with a lower virological setpoint. The authors attributed this result to the cytostatic effect of hydroxyurea on CD4 T cells.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2000</LINK> reported results of a timed-cycle STI in 26 participants. Twelve participants were randomized to an intervention arm of three cycles of STI with use of an interleukin co-intervention; continuous ART was administered in the control arm. Eligibility criteria of participants were HIV-1 asymptomatic adults &gt;2years, two years of viral suppression with ART, HIV-1RNA &lt;50 copies/ml for 24 months, and CD4:CD8 ratio&gt;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_" TYPE="STUDY">1</LINK> for duration greater than six months. In the intervention arm, there were reports of HIV-1RNA rebound in all three STI cycles. No significant change in CD4 and CD8 T cell counts or in memory and naive subpopulations were seen. The authors suggested use of immune-based therapies for restoring HIV specific immune response.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 2003</LINK> reported results from a timed-cycle STI trial with 12 participants. Three cycles of STI (2 cycles of 1 month, followed by a 3-month final interruption) were attempted. Eligibility criteria of participants were CD4&gt;400, VL&lt;50 and duration of HIV 12 years. Pre-ART HIV RNA-level predicted HIV RNA-level during STI. Four of eight participants (50%) maintained stable CD4 T cell counts during STI. In three participants, rash, myalgia and respiratory symptoms were reported. Duration of STI affected CD4 cells. The authors suggested avoidance of STI in patients with high viral loads and high virological setpoints. The study results were limited by small sample size.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK> investigated timed STI cycles of 2 weeks, 4 and 6 weeks (phase I) followed by a one long STI cycle (phase II) in a sample of 42 participants and compared to continuous ART group with a single interruption. Follow up of 81 weeks was reported. Eligibility criteria were CD4&gt;400, CD4 nadir&gt;100 and age&gt;18 years. Primary outcome was defined as time to viral rebound (&gt;5000 copies/ml) at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to time to viral rebound during the open ended TI of 4 weeks [1-8] weeks, and STI group 5 [4-8] weeks, (p=0.36). Secondary outcomes were defined as study-defined safety criteria, viral resistance, therapy failure and retention of immune constitution. There were no differences in secondary outcomes noted between groups. There was no evidence of postulated virological benefit or immune reconstitution, nor was there any reduction in adverse effects of ART. STI failed to confer a clinically signficant virological benefit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK> reported follow up data on 45 participants recruited from two trials, the Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial and a pilot study by Garcia et al. In these trials, STI of "one week on and one week off" were attempted. In the pilot STI trial, a total of five cycles of STI were attempted. At baseline, participants had VL&lt;20 copies/ml for 32 weeks, HAART duration for one year. In patients with nadir CD4&gt;400, increased HIV-1 specific immune response seen; significant decrease in CD4 T cell percentage (p&lt;0.001); and an increase in response to CD8T cell between day 0 and week 52 (p&lt;0.0001) was reported. VL set point during final STI was lower, positively correlated to baseline VL before HAART (p&lt;0.0001). STI did not control viral replication, possibly because boosted cytotoxic cell responses lacked durable, strong and sustained helper T cell response. To reset VL set point, alternative approaches to augment helper T cell response need investigation. Reduction of viral set point after STI was not understood. HIV-1 specific cellular immune responses can be augmented following cycles of therapy interruption in very early stage HIV-1 chronically infected individual.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK> reported long term clinical follow up data for 2 years on 26 of 60 participants of STI trials, who stayed off therapy after STI in 60 participants. Timed-cycle STI of varying durations (2 weeks to 4 months) were attempted. Eligibility criteria of participants were asymptomatic chronic HIV infection, pre STI viral load&lt;20 copies/ml, nadir CD4 &gt;500. Two of four trials used co-interventions hydroxyurea and mycophenolic mofetil in addition to STI. At the end of 2 years, in 11/26 participants, the plasma viral load without ART was significantly lower than pre HAART plasma VL and CD4 cell counts remained stable in all patients. Plasma VL remained lower than the viral set point. 43% patients did not resume therapy long term, and 42% patients had a lower virological setpoint. 18% patients with CD4 &gt;500 were able to maintain a lower pVL for a long time after a period of STI. The authors concluded that STI could benefit a minority of patient population.</P>

<P>In this category, timed-cycle STI of 1-2 months were attempted in eight controlled trials in small samples of patients (n=9-20). As a result of STI, a pattern of a decrease in HIV-specific CD4 T-cell counts and viral rebound was noticed across five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Molto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Molto 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Montes 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2000</LINK>). An increase in CD8 T-cell immune response was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2000</LINK>). In one study, there were no significant changes in metabolic parameters (serum hepatic transaminase, lipid levels as a result of STI (<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2001</LINK>). An increase in interleukin-16 was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Montes 2005</LINK>).

</P>
<P>Ortiz GM 2001 attempted three cycles of STI of one month and three months duration in 12 participants. Eligibility criteria were CD4 counts&gt;400 cells/ml for six months, VL&lt;400 copies/ml for three months, and normal renal, hepatic, and hemopoietic function. In STI participants, a decrease in HIV specific CD4 T-cell counts (p=0.001), an increase in HIV specific CD8 T-cell response (p=0.003), a rebound in VL (viral load) (p=0.34) was noticed. In control participants, stable CD4 cell counts, no increase in CD8 T cell counts and VL were reported. There was no clear benefit accrued to STI in this study. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lori-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lori 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Foli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Foli 2002</LINK> attempted one timed-cycle STI of 8 weeks duration, in 9 participants, the PANDA cohort (treated with hydroxyurea and didanosine), and compared them to a control group (n=7) on continuous ART. Eligibility criteria were CD4 counts of 250-500 cells/microlitre, on hydroxyurea/didanosine, and similar VL and CD4 at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Lori-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lori 2002</LINK>, STI participants (the PANDA trial) reported a significant control of viral rebound (p&lt;0.002), with a median increase in CD4 cells from 444 cells/mm3 to 512 cells/mm3. In comparison, four of seven control participants failed to control VL, with a decrease in CD4 T-cell count. This trial suggested that HIV could be controlled during STI, and that hydroxyurea and didanosine could prove valuable additions to therapy. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Foli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Foli 2002</LINK> also reported on the PANDA cohort. STI participants contained viral rebound during STI, with no significant changes in CD4 counts from a median of 444 cells/mm3 to a median of 512 cells /mm3 at week 8 (p=0.31). In the comparison group, reports of significant decrease in CD4 counts from 428 cells/mm3 to 340 cells/mm3 (p=0.02) were seen. A linear correlation between viral load at baseline and at the end of STI was noted. In comparison, control patients on continuous ART experienced a significant drop in CD4 counts from 428 cells/mm3 to 340 cells/mm3 (p=0.02). At week 40, differences between the STI and the control group were not significant (p=0.14). Foli suggested that the potential of STI to enhance immune response differed from patient to patient, and that hydroxyurea aided in control of virus. <BR/>

<BR/>The largest study in this category was the Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial (SSITT), which recruited 133 patients. Eligibility criteria were baseline median CD4 count of 740/microlitre, and an undetectable viral load. Four fixed cycle STI cycles of "2 weeks off and 8 weeks on" were attempted. This trial generated and refuted a major hypothesis in the field. </P>
<P>The SSITT was reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fagard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fagard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Metzner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Metzner 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oxenius-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oxenius 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oxenius-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Oxenius 2002a</LINK>).<I> </I>

<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2003</LINK> suggested an increased risk of development of resistance in timed-cycle STI. Factors such as pro-viral DNA, cell associated HIV RNA, pretreatment plasma VL predicted viral replication in STI.A small sub group of patients with slower viral rebound could qualify as candidates for STI. <LINK REF="STD-Metzner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Metzner 2003</LINK> reported that variants of HIV-1 virus carrying drug resistant mutations could emerge during periods of HIV-1 replication.

<P>Four trials reported on the novel CD4-guided STI strategy. The first randomized controlled trial to compare alternative STI strategies was the multicentric STACCATO trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ananworanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ananworanich 2003</LINK>). This trial had three arms, a "one week on and one week off" (WOWO) STI arm, a CD4-guided STI arm and a continuous ART arm. It was reported by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ananworanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ananworanich 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cardiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiello 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nuesch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuesch 2005</LINK>)<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Ananworanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ananworanich 2003</LINK> reported results in different arms. The eligibility criteria of participants were CD4&gt;350 copies/ml, and VL&lt;50 copies/ml. In timed-cycle "one week on and one week off " STI arm, virological failure (VL&gt;500 copies/ml) was reported in 53% patients, leading to premature termination of this arm. In comparison to the continuous ART arm, virologic failure was reported in two patients. In the CD4-guided arm, there were no virologic failures. The success of this arm set the trend for future exploration of CD4-guided STI cycles.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cardiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiello 2005</LINK> reported on clinical outcomes in 71 patients from the STACCATO trial. At the end of STI, the median CD4 in the WOWO arm was 582, in the CD4 arm it was 547, and in the control arm it was 637. The VL (log copies/ml) in the WOWO arm was 1.70, in the CD4 arm it was 1.96 and in the control arm it was 1.69. Undetectable viral load was achieved in 72% of participants in the WOWO arm, 45% of participants in the CD4 arm, and 100% of participants in control arm. Grade 3 and Grade 4 events were reported in 46% of participants in the WOWO arm, 65% of participants in the CD4 arm and 44% of participants in the control arm. Treatment failure was reported in 31% participants in the WOWO arm. Comparing time on therapy in the three arms: on continuous ART it was 100%; in the CD4-guided arm it was 87%; and the fixed cycle arm it was 96%. In the CD4-guided arm, participants did very well, although savings in ART and long-term outcomes need to be investigated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Nuesch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuesch 2005</LINK> reported follow up on this trial at 108 weeks. Resistance tests were conducted in 20 of 23 HIV-infected Thai patients. There were reports of one major mutation (T215Y) in the CD4 arm. There were no reports of virological failure at 48 weeks. At 108 weeks, there were reports of one virological failure in the STI arm and one virological failure in the continuous arm. CD4-guided STI appear to be safe in this patient population. Mutations in CD4-guided arm decreased from 36% pre STI, to 6% after STI. <BR/> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maggiolo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maggiolo 2004</LINK> reported on the BASTA study that investigated CD4-guided STI in a sample of 69 patients. Eligibility criteria of participants were age &gt;18 years, CD4&gt;800, VL&lt;50 copies/ml. At baseline, VL was undetectable and CD4 was 1077 copies/ml. Intention to treat analysis was conducted in this study. Follow up duration was reported at 64 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects maintaining a CD4 cell count &gt;400. The secondary endpoint was defined as the dynamic and predictive variables of CD4 cell loss. In the STI group, participants with a CD4 cell count &lt;400 were not statistically different from those in the control group. There were no differences in metabolic parameters between STI and control groups. Two patients developed adverse events. In a multivariate model, the parameter significantly associated with the possibility to stay off therapy and prolong STI was CD4 cell count (B-1.749, p=0.001). The main predictor of decline in CD4 was nadir CD4 (p&lt;0.001). Greater viral rebound and greater cell loss were reported in the low nadir CD4 group. CD4-guided STI were considered safe in patients with fully controlled virus. Overall, pulse therapy seems to be an alternative strategy for a wide variety of chronic-HIV-infected individuals responding to HAART.</P>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK> reported results of CD4-guided STI of variable durations in 71 patients. During follow-up of 28.3 months, 49 patients restarted therapy and 22 remained off therapy. The first interruption median duration was 15 months. The overall reduction of time off therapy was 71%. The variable significantly associated with duration of the first interruption were age HR 1.05 (1.02-1.09), stage of disease HR 5.20 (2.14-12.91) and nadir CD4. Those with low nadir CD4 (&lt;200) reported HR 16.48 (6.2-43.7) and those with nadir CD4 200-349 reported HR 2.58 (1.36-4.8) compared to baseline nadir CD4 (&gt;349). In a multivariate model, nadir CD4 count emerged as a strong predictor of duration of interruption. Nadir CD4 also determined the total time off therapy. Thirty-five percent (35%) had nadir CD4&lt;200, 63% had CD4 200-349, and 81% had CD4&gt;349. Complete virologic suppression was achieved when therapy was reintroduced. The duration of first interruption and the reduction of time on therapy significantly correlated with nadir CD4 cell count. Patients rapidly regained CD4 counts on treatment resumption. If monitored carefully, treatment interruptions guided by CD4 cell were clinically safe in patients with high CD4 cell counts. <BR/>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK> reported results of CD4-guided TI of variable durations in this single arm trial. Compared to patients with CD4&gt;500 cells/mm3, those with a baseline CD4 cell count of &lt;200 were 4.4 times more likely to resume therapy, and those with CD4 counts between 200-350 cells/mm3 were 3 times more likely to resume therapy. The decrease in CD4 count was 159 in those who resumed therapy compared to 80 in those who did not. Viral load was 64,500 in those who resumed therapy compared to 20,000 in those who did not. The best predictor of TI duration was pre treatment CD4 cell count. Participants with low virological set points and high CD4 cell count were able to discontinue therapy. Patients with greatest increase in CD4 post ART experienced the most rapid decline in CD4 cells. </P>

</B>Of 11 randomized controlled trials in this category, a majority were judged to be of moderate quality (3/5) on Jadad's scale. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK>) scored high on quality (4/5). A majority of the studies (&gt;90%) were unclear in reporting of concealment of treatment allocation. An intention to treat analyses, power and sample size calculations were clearly reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maggiolo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maggiolo 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to doubts about nature and safety of the intervention, blinding was not attempted in the trials. However, withdrawals and dropouts were clearly reported in all the trials. The longest follow-up durations (one and two years) were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK>). Primary outcomes were clearly reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maggiolo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maggiolo 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Papasavvas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papasavvas 2004</LINK>).

</B>Of seven controlled trials in this category, a majority were judged to be of moderate to poor quality (2/5 to 1/5) on Jadad's scale. All the trials were non-randomized and blinding was not attempted. Although there was a clear reporting of withdrawals and dropouts, the reported follow up was of short duration but varied considerably across trials (8 weeks-64 weeks). Due to small sample sizes (12-45), there was limited power to detect differences between groups. Although these trials were non-randomized, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>) reported measures of effect.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>A) Methodological limitations of studies</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sample size: </B>Many trials were of small sample size (&lt;100), thus the power of the studies to detect differences was limited. There was a high likelihood of making the type II error with small sample sizes. Moreover, there were no clear descriptions of a priori criteria for expecting a difference between groups, and explanations of calculations of power and sample size were unclear in the majority (&gt;90%) of trials. There was the possibility of erroneous conclusions based on power and sample size alone.<B> </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment: </B>In the majority of trials (&gt;98%), concealment of treatment allocation was inadequate and unclear, raising the possibility of performance bias. </P>
<P>
<B>Follow up: </B>In some studies, follow up of one and two years have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nuesch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuesch 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK>), but in the majority of studies, the follow up durations were less than 6 months. There is insufficient evidence to help assess the long-term safety of STI.</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention designs: </B>STI is an experimental intervention, and should be recognized as such in the studies. </P>
<P>
<B>Eligibility criteria: </B>Patient populations and eligibility criteria varied across trials<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Lack of standardization of outcome: </B>A lack of standardization of outcomes was evident across trials. Lack of definition of primary and secondary endpoints was also evident. Commonly reported outcomes were immunological (CD4, CD8, subset of CD4 cells, CD4:CD8 ratios) and virological (VL, HIV RNA level). Changes in means of outcomes (reported as significant/non-significant with <I>p</I> values) made it difficult to compare across studies. Measures of effect were reported in two trials. Due to inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes, it was difficult to compare the effect of intervention and interpret evidence across trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome reporting bias: </B>In studies where primary and secondary outcomes are not clearly stated, there is the possibility of outcome reporting bias. </P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion of uncontrolled trials: </B>Our objective was to synthesize evidence on STI for all outcomes reported by all trials in the field. We included non-randomized trials that were early pilot studies in the field on STI. The largest single arm trial, Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial, refuted the "auto-immunization hypothesis." This was a major development in the field of STI. The results of this trial were replicated later by randomized controlled trials in the field. </P>
<P>
<B>Bias (selection, detection, attrition, performance bias) </B>In RCT, trials were open due to doubts about nature and safety of intervention, outcome assessors were unblinded to the intervention, thus there is possibility of detection bias. Allocation concealment was inadequately reported in a majority (&gt;95%)of the trials, thus there is a possibility of performance bias. In two trials, co-interventions, such as hydroxyurea, and interleukins, were used in addition to STI. It was difficult to separate the effect of STI from that due to the co-intervention. </P>
<P>
<B>Inconsistent measures of effect: </B> Due to reporting of different outcomes by different trials, and lack of standardization in reporting outcomes, a consistent measure of the intervention could not be evaluated across trials. Hazard ratios (HR) were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>,<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>). HR were estimated for progression to AIDS-defining illness stratified over levels of CD4 in one study. In another study, HR were reported for likelihood of resuming treatment stratified over levels of CD4.</P>
<P>
<B>Varying durations of follow up: </B>A majority of the trials (&gt;90%) reported follow up less than six months. One trial reported on CD4-guided STI at 108 weeks <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Nuesch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuesch 2005</LINK>
<I>),</I> and the results indicated better performance of this trial. The other two fixed cycle STI trials reported follow up for one and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Florence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florence 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plana-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Plana 2004</LINK>). Due to varying durations of follow up, long term safety and efficacy of this strategy could not be assessed. </P>
<P>
<B>Semantics in STI: </B>Semantics in STI are a matter of concern. A variety of terms, such as "on and off cycling," "strategic treatment interruptions," "planned treatment interruptions," "supervised treatment interruptions," "sequential treatment interruptions," "cyclical therapy," "structured intermittent therapy," "supervised intermittent therapy," and "pulse therapy" were all used to describe STI. </P>
<P>
<B>Definition of STI: </B>Although the concept, and hypothesis for STI was clearly stated, the consensus on the definition of STI was clearly lacking in a majority of studies. </P>
<P>
<B>B) Applicability: risks/benefits of STI <BR/>
</B>STI strategies present several challenges. </P>
<P>
<B>Viral rebound: </B>During timed-cycle STI, there is a risk of significant viral rebound, a concern of reseeding viral reservoirs and a risk of transmission of virus (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ortiz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ortiz 2001</LINK>). STI also run the risk of development of resistance and emergence of viral mutations during periods of viral replication. (<LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Picado-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Picado 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martini 2002</LINK>). Factors such as use of ART with greater bioavailability and long intracellular half-lives, presence of suboptimal therapy in the past and adherence to ART also played a role in evolution of resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK>). In CD4-guided STI so far, the viral suppression is achieved after resumption of treatment. (<LINK REF="STD-Ananworanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ananworanich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiello 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>CD4 cells: </B>There is a risk of loss of peripheral CD4 T cells during periods off therapy. Nadir CD4 cell appeared to play an important role as major predictor of STI especially in CD4-guided STI strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>). Although a pattern of decline in CD4 in timed-cycle STI was noticed, pulse therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>) and CD4-guided STI (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>) produced no significant immunological impairment. </P>
<P>
<B>ART regimens: type, duration, cycling of drugs:</B> A major challenge in STI is to interrupt ART regimes without jeopardizing efficacy of the treatment and impairing immune response. It is important to maintain an optimum drug level during STI. The durations of ART regimens both pre-STI and post-STI are also important in determining response to an STI. Varying ART regimens have been considered. Identification of safe regimens to interrupt is a challenging domain for research. It is also important to take into account the patient's immunological and virological profile, ART history (tolerance, safety and compliance), and presence or absence of resistance mutations before attempting STI. Drugs with long half-life and grater bioavailability have the potential for resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Opportunistic infections (OI): </B>The risk of recurrence of OI is always a concern in STI. In some studies, reports of acute retroviral syndrome, cases of oral candidiasis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, were reported during STI (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Montes 2005</LINK>). In CD4-guided STI strategies, there were no reports of AIDS-defining illness (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>) </P>
<P>
<B>ART toxicities: </B>It was thought that STI would lead to reduction in ART toxicities. Two studies investigating timed-cycle STI, however, demonstrated no reduction in metabolic parameters, though follow-up durations were limited to less than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Dybul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dybul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hatano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hatano 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life: </B>It is hoped that STI will provide improvement in quality of life in the long term. Patients found improvement in their quality of life during STI, but faced difficulty in reinitiating treatment after STI (<LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2001</LINK>).<B> </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Factors determining response to STI: </B>To summarize, the factors hypothesized to play a role in determining success of timed-cycle STI were the baseline immunological and virological profile of participants, resistance mutations and suboptimal therapy, and past ART regimens. Predictors such as pro-viral DNA levels, viral levels in reservoirs, rate of drop in CD4 during STI, and the rate of virological control during STI determined response to an STI.( <LINK REF="STD-Fagard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fagard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oxenius-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Oxenius 2002a</LINK>). In CD4-guided STI cycles, nadir CD4 emerged as an important predictor of STI (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maggiolo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maggiolo 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>C) Evolution of research in STI:</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Early pilot studies:</B> The early research in single arm trials explored the "auto-vaccination hypothesis," i.e., that repeated exposure to autologous virus would stimulate immune response. However, this hypothesis was refuted by the results of largest single arm intervention study, the Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fagard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fagard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oxenius-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oxenius 2002</LINK>). The data were corroborated by small uncontrolled trials and several controlled trials in the field. </P>
<P>
<B>Timed-cycle STI: </B>Later, in the setting of randomized controlled trials, various timed-cycle strategies of varying durations were attempted in eligible participants. In all timed-cycle STI trials, a pattern was evident. There was no enhancement of immune benefit, nor was there a significant virological benefit due to STI. This led investigators to lose hope of enhancing immune response. There was a gain in CD8 T-cell- specific response in some studies, but it failed to sustain itself in the long term. In some trials, concerns about development of resistance were raised. There was no reduction in metabolic parameters in the long term, leading us to reject the notion of reduction of antiretroviral drug toxicities.</P>
<P>
<B>CD4-guided STI: </B>In one randomized trial, two STI strategies, a timed-cycle "one week on and one week off" STI and a CD4-guided STI, were attempted (<LINK REF="STD-Ananworanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ananworanich 2003</LINK>). Reports of development of resistance in the timed-cycle STI, and favorable outcomes in the CD4-guided STI cycle arm, set a trend towards investigation of CD4-guided STI trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boschi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschi 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cardiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiello 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggiolo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maggiolo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarwater-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tarwater 2003</LINK>). In these trials, where variable STI durations were attempted, they monitored CD4 levels. Patients with high nadir CD4 (&gt;400-500) qualified for this approach. Although a greater tolerability of this approach was reported in terms of the risk of clinical disease progression, concerns were raised about extent of immunological impairment due to long periods off treatment, and sustainability of this approach over longer durations of time. Moreover, hypothesized reductions in ART side effects and toxicities were not adequately investigated. A reduction in costs of ART and mutations however, was demonstrated by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cardiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiello 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuesch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuesch 2005</LINK>). Trials are currently underway investigating long-term effects of this approach (e.g. SMART, BASTA). Results of these trials are expected in a few years. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>D) Limitations of the review: <BR/>
</B>We used a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies. We attempted to contact authors for additional information regarding trials. We were unable to include non-English-language studies, abstracts, letters, and unpublished data, due to a lack of peer-reviewed material. Given the rapid evolution of research in this field, there is a possibility of having missed a few studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on our review, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of timed-cycle and CD4-guided STI cycles in patients with chronic suppressed HIV infection. Further research is warranted to comment on the efficacy of STI over long periods of time. Timed-cycle STI provided no clear evidence of immunological and virologic benefit. Development of resistance, and no reduction in ART toxicities were reported. In comparison, CD4 cycle STI strategy reported favorable outcomes (no immunological impairment, reduction in exposure to ART, reduction in mutations) in the short term, but the long term effects of this strategy have not yet been completely investigated.</P>
<P>STI in practice require careful monitoring of clinical, virological, immunological and drug related outcomes. Several STI trials worldwide are currently underway to compare the long-term outcomes of timed-cycle and CD4-guided STI strategies. Some trials have incorporated therapeutic vaccines and immune-adjuvants, in addition to STI, to potentiate immune response. However, until the results of ongoing trials become available, STI should not be attempted by patients themselves, outside of controlled clinical trial settings. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for development of a standard methodology of reporting trials. In addition, a standardized reporting of important primary and secondary endpoints, with measures of effect should be emphasized. This will aid in assessment of comparisons across studies and assessment of efficacy of the intervention. Investigation of important secondary outcomes such as development of resistance, adverse effects of drugs, reduction in metabolic parameters, effect on quality of life, and reduction in costs will help assess overall efficacy of STI interventions. A long-term follow up with monitoring of immunological and virological parameters will help assess the safety of this strategy. </P>

<P>Primary end point was the proportion of subjects maintaining a CD4 cell count &gt;400. Secondary end point was to identify the dynamic and predictive variables of CD4 cell loss. Number of patients in the STI group with a Cd4 &lt;400 was not statistically significant from number of people in the control group. Main predictor of decline in CD4 was nadir CD4 with (p&lt;0.001); Greater viral rebound and greater cell loss reported in low nadir CD4 group;Intention to treat analysis done. In a multivariate model, parameter significantly associated with possibility to stay off therapy and prolong STI was CD4 cell count(B-1.749, p=0.001). Duraton of first STI was signficantly different between STI groups stratified by CD4 nadir levels.
