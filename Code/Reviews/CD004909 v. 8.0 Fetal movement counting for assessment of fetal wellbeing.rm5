<P>Not enough evidence on counting the baby's movements in the womb to check for wellbeing.</P>
<P>Mothers can usually feel their babies moving in their wombs from around 16 to 20 weeks. Babies' activities in the womb can vary considerably, some being very active and some not so active. A decrease in a baby's normal pattern of movements may be a sign that the baby is struggling for some reason and it might be better for the baby to be born early. Hence, it has been suggested that if the mother counts her babies' movements each day, and there are several ways of doing this, she may be able to identify a decrease in her baby's normal movement patterns. It is further suggested that if the mother informs caregivers of this, then the caregivers can do additional tests and some babies can be prevented from dying before birth. However, sometimes fetal movement-counting tests can cause considerable anxiety for women and may not be easy for some women especially when a mother is busy at work or caring for other small children, so it is important to assess if these tests are helpful in identifying babies in difficulty with time then to intervene. </P>
<P>The review of trials found five studies, involving 71,458 women, comparing two fetal movement counting methods, fetal movement counting versus hormonal analysis and routine fetal movement counting compared with standard antenatal care, as defined by trial authors. In studies that compared routine counting of baby's movements in the womb with mixed or undefined counting, there was no difference in stillbirths, caesarean sections, birth weight less than 10th centile and mother-baby attachment; there was reduction in women's anxiety in the group counting the baby's movements. There was a tendency to more antenatal admissions. When counting of baby's movement was compared with hormonal analysis, there were fewer hospital visits among women who were counting and fewer babies in the hormonal analysis group had low Apgar scores, which assess the baby's condition after birth. There was no difference between the groups in terms of caesarean sections done and other outcomes. 'Perinatal death or severe morbidity' was not reported. When different types of fetal movement counting methods (once a day compared to more than once a day) were compared, women were more compliant in using the once a day counting method, citing less interruption with daily activities as one of the reasons; the incidence of caesarean section did not differ and perinatal death or severe illness was not reported. The numbers and the methodological quality of studies were insufficient to assess stillbirths accurately. Further trials are suggested, and it would be very important to assess women's anxiety and views in addition to the ability of the counting to prevent stillbirths.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-14 15:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Fetal movement counting is a method by which a woman quantifies the movements she feels to assess the condition of her baby. The purpose is to try to reduce perinatal mortality by alerting caregivers when the baby might be compromised. This method may be used routinely, or only in women who are considered at increased risk of complications affecting the baby. Fetal movement counting may allow the clinician to make appropriate interventions in good time to improve outcomes. On the other hand, fetal movement counting may cause unnecessary anxiety to pregnant women, or elicit unnecessary interventions.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess outcomes of pregnancy where fetal movement counting was done routinely, selectively or was not done at all; and to compare different methods of fetal movement counting.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-13 09:02:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Two review authors assessed studies for eligibility, assessed the methodological quality of included studies and independently extracted data from studies. Where possible the effects of interventions were compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For some outcomes, the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:56:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Five studies (71,458 women) were included in this review; 68,654 in one cluster-RCT. None of these five trials were assessed as having low risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. All included studies except for one (which included high-risk women as participants) included women with uncomplicated pregnancies.Two studies compared fetal movement counting with standard care, as defined by trial authors. Two included studies compared two types of fetal movement counting; once a day fetal movement counting (Cardiff count-to-10) with more than once a day fetal movement counting methods. One study compared fetal movement counting with hormone assessment.</P>
<P>(<B>1) Routine fetal movement counting versus mixed or undefined fetal movement counting</B>
</P>
<P>No study reported on the primary outcome 'perinatal death or severe morbidity'. In one large cluster-RCT, there was no difference in mean stillbirth rates per cluster (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.07; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, <I>low quality evidence</I>). The other study reported no fetal deaths. There was no difference in caesarean section rate between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.44; participants = 1076; studies = one,<I> low quality evidence</I>). Maternal anxiety was significantly reduced with routine fetal movement counting (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.10; participants = 1013; studies = one, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Maternal-fetal attachment was not significantly different (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.11; participants = 951; studies = one, <I>low quality evidence</I>). In one study antenatal admission after reporting of decreased fetal movements was increased (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.52; participants = 123; studies = one). In another there was a trend to more antenatal admissions per cluster in the counting group than in the control group (SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.93; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Birthweight less than 10th centile was not significantly different between groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.44; participants = 1073; studies = one, <I>low quality evidence</I>). The evidence was of low quality due to imprecise results and because of concerns regarding unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Formal fetal movement counting (Modified Cardiff method) versus hormone analysis</B>
</P>
<P>There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of caesarean section (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69; participants = 1191; studies = one). Women in the formal fetal movement counting group had significantly fewer hospital visits than those randomised to hormone analysis (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.35), whereas there were fewer Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes for women randomised to hormone analysis (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.93). No other outcomes reported showed statistically significant differences. 'Perinatal death or severe morbidity' was not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Formal fetal movement counting once a day (count-to-10) versus formal fetal movement counting method where counting was done more than once a day (after meals)</B>
</P>
<P>The incidence of caesarean section did not differ between the groups under this comparison (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.61 to 8.99; participants = 1400; studies = one). Perinatal death or severe morbidity was not reported. Women were more compliant in using the count-to-10 method than they were with other fetal movement counting methods, citing less interruption with daily activities as one of the reasons (non-compliance RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.32).</P>
<P>Except for one cluster-RCT, included studies were small and used different comparisons, making it difficult to measure the outcomes using meta-analyses. The nature of the intervention measured also did not allow blinding of participants and clinicians..</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-14 15:42:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>This review does not provide sufficient evidence to influence practice. In particular, no trials compared fetal movement counting with no fetal movement counting. Only two studies compared routine fetal movements with standard antenatal care, as defined by trial authors. Indirect evidence from a large cluster-RCT suggested that more babies at risk of death were identified in the routine fetal monitoring group, but this did not translate to reduced perinatal mortality. Robust research by means of studies comparing particularly routine fetal movement counting with selective fetal movement counting is needed urgently, as it is a common practice to introduce fetal movement counting only when there is already suspected fetal compromise.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-08 11:03:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The goal for care during pregnancy is a healthy baby and a satisfied mother. There are many ways of monitoring the baby's condition during pregnancy. Examples of these are auscultation of the fetal heart with the fetal stethoscope, cardiotocography (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grivell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grivell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pattison-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattison 2010</LINK>), fetal acoustic (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2013</LINK>) or other stimulation, ultrasound for biophysical profile (<LINK REF="REF-Lalor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lalor 2008</LINK>), umbilical artery waveform analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2015</LINK>), fetal echocardiography and colour flow mapping, fetal electrocardiography (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2013</LINK>), fetal pulse oximetry (<LINK REF="REF-East-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2014</LINK>) and fetal movement counting. Fetal movement counting is the only method which can be used by the mother without the need for a clinician or equipment.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:25:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Primigravidae usually feel fetal movements for the first time at 18 to 20 weeks and multipara start feeling fetal movements at 16 to 18 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Cronje-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronje 1996</LINK>). Fetal movements are maximal between 28 and 34 weeks and, although there is evidence to suggest that fetal movements do not decrease in late pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00e5_destad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rådestad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winje-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winje 2011</LINK>), there is often a perceived decrease in fetal movements near term. This is because movements become more organised as pregnancy progresses with increased motor co-ordination resulting in slower, more powerful, gross movements (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Elia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Elia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayburn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayburn 1990</LINK>). Fetal movements can occur without the mother recognising them, especially at term, when the mother recognises about 40% of fetal movements. Fetal movements in a healthy fetus can vary from four to 100 movements per hour (<LINK REF="REF-Cronje-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronje 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the fetus is compromised, movements may be decreased as the fetus reduces oxygen consumption in an effort to conserve energy supplies and movements may not be felt for one or more days. A period of decreased fetal movements commonly precedes fetal death, but the absence of perceived fetal movements does not necessarily indicate fetal death or fetal compromise. Decreased fetal movements may be due to decreased amniotic fluid, drugs, smoking habits, maternal overweight, sedatives, sleep state in the fetus and fetal compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Sellers-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellers 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tveit-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tveit 2010</LINK>). External stimuli may either increase, decrease, or even arrest fetal movements (<LINK REF="REF-Cronje-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronje 1996</LINK>). Some suggest that fetal movement counting should be performed in all high-risk women, whether they are admitted to hospital or not (<LINK REF="REF-Cronje-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronje 1996</LINK>), but the evidence to support this needs to be assessed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:26:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Fetal movement counting is a method used by the mother to quantify her baby's movements (for descriptions of formal fetal movement counting, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). When counting fetal movements at rest, a woman may be asked to empty her bladder, lie on her side, relax, put her hand on her abdomen and count the fetal movements over the period specified for the method used. Fetal movements may also be counted during normal activity. Patterns of fetal movements are considered an indicator of fetal wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Bennet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennet 1999</LINK>). According to <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>, all participants in their study, comparing three different methods of fetal movement counting, saw monitoring of fetal movements as a necessary activity. They found a 'count-to-10' method more user-friendly than the other methods and higher rates of compliance with a 'count-to-10' method have been found (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2007a</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Liston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Liston 1994</LINK> found no deleterious side-effects in low-risk pregnant women monitoring their babies by fetal movement counting.</P>
<P>In the 'count-to-10' method, the woman is asked to count 10 fetal movements from a specific time each day. She is advised to report if the fetus takes longer than usual to achieve the 10 movements, or if there are fewer than 10 movements in 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bennet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennet 1999</LINK>). This is taken as a warning sign that the fetus may be becoming compromised. In the Sadovsky method a woman counts fetal movements three times a day after meals (F).</P>
<P>In the fixed-period method, fetal movement counting may be done over a period of one hour, daily or, if a rapidly changing condition is anticipated, six-hourly. If fetal movements are fewer than four in one hour, movement counting is repeated in the next hour (<LINK REF="REF-Freda-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freda 1993</LINK>). Fetal movement counting may be done in hospital or at home, and the chart brought to every antenatal visit.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-19 19:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A sudden decrease in the number of fetal movements is suggestive of fetal compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Cronje-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronje 1996</LINK>). The rationale for fetal movement counting is that it is hoped that fetal death can be prevented by acting immediately when the woman reports decreased fetal movements.</P>
<P>When starting a woman on a fetal movement chart, it has been suggested that a clinician should go through the procedure with her and palpate her abdomen as she is counting fetal movements to see whether she can identify them (<LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2000</LINK>). Providing uniform information aimed at increasing maternal awareness and vigilance to decreased fetal activity has been associated benefit in reducing stillbirth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Tveit-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tveit 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sometimes the period between decreased movements and fetal death is too short for clinicians to intervene to prevent fetal death (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). If fetal movements are decreased from the normal pattern of the baby's movement, fetal wellbeing can be assessed with further tests such as cardiotocography (CTG - electronic measurement of the baby's heartbeat) (<LINK REF="REF-Nolte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolte 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2000</LINK>). Most clinicians would agree that if the CTG pattern is reactive with normal fetal activity and no other complications of pregnancy, there is no need for other forms of assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-22 13:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetal movement counting is simple, and can be done at home. It is economical as there are no human or material resources needed, but it does intrude on the woman's time and it may cause unnecessary anxiety to the mother. It may lead to staff overload as additional investigations may have to be done to exclude fetal compromise. It might increase antenatal admissions, obstetric interventions and prematurity. It is important to establish whether, in practice, benefits outweigh risks or vice versa, both as a routine procedure and in selected high-risk pregnancies.</P>
<P>A previous review of two randomised trials found that routine counting was associated with frequent reports of decreased fetal activity, increased use of other techniques, frequent antepartum admissions and increased caesarean sections on the basis of decreased fetal movements (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). Some authors have continued to highlight the importance of the method while others express concerns about the disadvantages of fetal movement counting. Furthermore, survey research has revealed wide variation in clinical practice, internationally, with regard to fetal movement assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Heazell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heazell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2014</LINK>). It is important that this review be conducted to address whether this method is useful to identify fetal compromise in time for effective interventions. Although inexpensive, the test should not be performed unless it proves to do more good than harm.</P>
<P>The original version of this review did not provide any conclusive evidence as to whether fetal movement counting is beneficial or not. It recommended that robust research should be conducted to assess fetal movement counting for the assessment of fetal wellbeing.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the outcome of pregnancy when fetal movement counting is done routinely, selectively, or not at all, and using various methods.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>
<I>). </I>We resolved any disagreement by discussion and by involving one of the authors. For individual randomised trials we assessed the risk of bias using the criteria (1) to (7) below. For cluster-randomised trials we had planned to assess the risk of bias using the criteria described in section 16.3.2 of the <I>Handbook</I> (i.e. recruitment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters, incorrect analysis and comparability with individually-randomised trials); however, as the one included cluster trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK>) had no loss of clusters and randomised participants at an individual participant level within multiple sites, we assessed this report as per the criteria outlined below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. </P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of evidence using GRADE</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following key outcomes for the comparison "routine fetal movement counting versus mixed or undefined fetal movement counting".</P>

<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence was downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:28:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For all included trials, except one (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK>), an individual woman, an individual fetus or an individual neonate was the unit of analysis. None of the studies included women with twin pregnancies. The <LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK> study used clusters as the unit of analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We planned to adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. Where both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, were identified, we had planned to synthesise the relevant information. This, however, was not possible due to the diverse nature of the interventions and lack of comparable data to perform a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The one cluster-randomised trial included presented data by cluster, not individual, therefore sample size adjustment was not necessary.</P>
<P>We assessed qualitative data on women's views of the method in the discussion section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not include any cross-over trials in this review and we do not intend to include them in the future because fetal movements depend on the age of the fetus and comparing fetal movements at different fetal ages will not be ideal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The unit of analysis was an individual woman in maternal outcomes and where outcomes measures were fetal or neonatal the unit of analysis was an individual fetus or an individual neonate respectively. All included studies excluded women with twin pregnancies.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-05-22 09:23:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. Had we detected high levels of missing data in studies, we would have explored the impact of including these studies in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. However, due to the differing nature of the interventions in the review and the absence/limited number of meta-analyses, this was not necessary.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-13 10:38:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We had few studies, measuring different comparisons and different outcomes. We performed only one meta-analysis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either a Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:30:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We conducted only one meta-analysis. If in future updates we have 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will seek statistical support to perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:31:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Due to the differing nature of the interventions in the included studies, we were able to perform a meta-analysis on only one of the reported outcomes. We planned to use a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there had been clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would have used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary would have been treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we would have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials. This applied to the one meta-analysis we performed.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:31:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In future updates, if we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>

<P>In this update we included too few studies, with limited contributions to the outcomes for us to carry out a sensitivity analysis. In future updates, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of fixed-effect versus random-effects analyses for outcomes with statistical heterogeneity, as well as the effects of exclusion of studies with higher risk of bias and the effects of varying assumptions regarding the ICC of cluster-randomised trials.</P>

There were about 1000 women in each cluster. Data were presented with clusters as the units of analysis (n = 33 pairs). For some outcomes, data from only 26 pairs of clusters were available. The method of allocation concealment was not described in all included trials, therefore the studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:53:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>None of the included studies compared the effects of fetal movement counting selectively or routinely with no fetal movement counting on perinatal outcome, which was the main objective of this review. The results neither confirm nor refute the effectiveness of fetal movement counting as a method of fetal surveillance.</P>
<P>The largest trial to date (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK>), compared routine fetal movement counting with 'normal care', which included fetal movement counting at the discretion of the caregiver (8.9% in a subset of 'control' participants received a formal fetal movement counting chart). The potential effect on perinatal outcome may have been masked by contamination of the 'control' group. There was likely to be a heightened awareness of the importance of fetal movements at the control sites because of their participation in the study. This likelihood is supported by two observations: (1) the rate of antepartum late fetal deaths in the control groups were considerably lower than in data collected prior to the commencement of the study; (2) the only subgroups, in which there was a trend towards reduced rates of unexplained late fetal deaths in the study group, were those in which the clusters were paired between rather than within hospitals and those in which the control consultants chose not to inform the control participants about the study (in both cases less likelihood of contamination).</P>
<P>The potential effectiveness of routine over discretionary fetal movement counting is also suggested by the fact that, when fetal movements were formally counted, there were more babies with subsequent unexplained late fetal deaths who were alive when first admitted to hospital (11/59 versus 6/58). The reasons for admission were reduced or absent fetal movements in 35/59 versus 16/58 respectively. However, the warnings did not translate into fewer deaths, mainly because of falsely reassuring fetal testing, mainly cardiotocography, and clinical error.</P>
<P>There is heterogeneity in two studies that compared compliance in once a day versus more than once a day counting methods. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1991</LINK> study, there was no significant difference in compliance between the 'count-to-10' and the Sadovsky method. In the <LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2003</LINK> study, women complied significantly better with the 'count-to-10' versus the Latin American Centre for Perinatology and human development (CLAP) fetal movement chart method because they thought it was easier. The study that carries more weight in this regard is the one by <LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2003</LINK> as it had a bigger sample size. Meta-analysis was not performed because of the degree of heterogeneity in these trials.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1991</LINK>, there was a high percentage of women in both groups who liked to count although the percentage was higher in the Sadovsky method than in the 'count-to-10' method. The high compliance rate in both groups, the acceptability of the method to the women, and the high number of women who liked to count fetal movements may indicate that there are few, if any, negative psychological factors associated with the method. However, this is a research area that needs to be explored further.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">

Other outcomes, such as other fetal testing, premature birth, birthweight &lt; 2500 g, assisted delivery, five-minute Apgar score of less than seven and admission to the neonatal unit were variously reported by either three, two or one of the included trials. None of the included trials reported on the outcomes of maternal satisfaction, umbilical cord pH of less than 7.2, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal encephalopathy, early neonatal death and childhood disability. This variation in outcome reporting is problematic for evidence synthesis as it reduces the ability to compare, combine and contrast outcomes from individual studies, resulting, ultimately, in less clinical applicability of the evidence when attempting to optimise decision-making on methods for assessing fetal wellbeing and on methods of fetal surveillance in practice.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:53:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Five trials with 71,458 participants were included in the analyses in the review. None of these five trials were assessed as having low risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Other than in the <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1990</LINK> study, in which there were post-randomisation exclusions of 24% in the counting group and 22% in the hormone analysis group, there was a low level of missing data in the studies. Selective reporting of outcomes was also assessed as low risk of bias in all of the studies, other than <LINK REF="STD-Saastad-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saastad 2011a</LINK>, who reported additional outcomes not pre-specified in the methods sections of the study reports. Other than one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK>), which contributed 68,654 women to the review, the numbers of participants in the trials were relatively small (ranging from 125 to 1400). In the one outcome of compliance where efforts to pool data from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1991</LINK>) were made, a high level of heterogeneity was present (I² = 95%). For this reason the results for this outcome were presented separately.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADEpro for the comparison "routine fetal movement counting compared to mixed or undefined fetal movement counting for assessment of fetal wellbeing." (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Evidence downgrading was based on including studies with unclear risk of bias and statistically non-significant results. None of the included trials reported the composite outcome perinatal death or neonatal morbidity, or caesarean section. Other than for the outcome of maternal anxiety, which was assessed to be of moderate quality, all of the other outcomes were assessed as being of low quality. This reduces the clinical applicability of these results.</P>

<P>We acknowledge that there is potential for bias in the review process as assessment of risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and is subject to individual interpretation. We attempted to minimise this by: 1) having two review authors independently assess risk of bias and carry out data extraction; 2) contacting study authors if study methods or results were unclear; and 3) consulting a third party if we were unable to resolve dilemmas.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-22 10:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The review is an update of the previous version of the Cochrane review on fetal movement counting for assessing fetal wellbeing. One new study, (<LINK REF="STD-Saastad-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saastad 2011a</LINK>) that provided additional data to the review, was included. The addition of these new data does not alter the conclusions of this review, and at present, there is insufficient evidence on whether formal fetal movement counting is beneficial or risky for assessing fetal wellbeing. Four additional reports were identified (one awaiting classification (<LINK REF="STD-Abasi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abasi 2010</LINK>) and three ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Delaram-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Delaram 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flenady-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Flenady 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helzlsouer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Helzlsouer 2013</LINK>)) and may be included in future updates, and have the potential to alter the current conclusions of the review.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence that formal fetal movement counting either for all women or for women at increased risk of problems with their babies is beneficial or not. The indirect evidence of the greater ability of formal rather than discretionary fetal movement counting to identify babies at risk of intrauterine death was not translated into reduced perinatal mortality, due to falsely reassuring fetal assessment tests and clinical error. Limited data suggest that women prefer daily counting to repeated counting periods throughout the day. Women in the fetal movement counting group identified growth restricted fetuses more than women who were not in the fetal movement counting group.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-09 15:15:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Because of indirect evidence from these studies that fetal movement counting may be beneficial, more research is needed in this area. Studies comparing fetal movement counting with no fetal movement counting would be difficult to implement because fetal movement counting, whether formal or informal, is widely practiced. More research should be conducted to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of fetal movement counting in detecting fetal compromise; its effectiveness in decreasing the perinatal mortality in high-risk and low-risk women; its effectiveness in low-resource settings with no acces to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring; its acceptability to women; how easy it is for women; and the best fetal movement counting method.</P>

<P>The original protocol did not specify that we would exclude quasi-randomised trials, this was added to the methods for "Types of studies" in the first published version of the review.</P>
<P>The outcomes "non-compliance", "number of hospital visits", "birthweight less than 10th centile", "consultation for decreased fetal movements" and "caesarean section due to absent fetal movement" which were not pre-specified in the protocol have been added to this review.</P>

<P>Compliance was defined as use of assigned charting method for 5 or more days a week for at least 4 consecutive weeks. Women in the FMC were allowed to miss only 1 30-minute period to be considered compliant.</P>
<P>The reason given for high compliance in the count-to-10 group was lack of interference with daily life activities but those who complied with CLAP method cited positive approach towards pregnancy and enhancement of maternal-fetal bonding as a major advantage.</P>
<P>Reasons for non-compliance with the count-to-10 method were inability to understand the chart recording and for the CLAP method the main reason given was interference with daily life activities.</P>

<P>Participants were not properly randomised. They were allocated according to their entry numbers. This trial showed significantly fewer deaths in the fetal movement count group in fetuses more than 1.500 g without major congenital malformation compared to the control group. In this study 1562 women were in the counting group and 1549 women were in the control group. Women in the counting group were given written information and instructions as to how to count and register their fetal movements and women in the control group were not instructed to count but were asked questions on fetal movement on each antenatal visit and were encouraged to report problems they encountered with fetal movements.<BR/>

Women had to count as early in the day as was convenient for them (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1989</LINK>). 2. Women were counting fetal movements daily on a modified 'count-to-10' chart indicating the time required to experience 10 consecutive movements.
