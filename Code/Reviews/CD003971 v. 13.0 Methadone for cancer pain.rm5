<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-31 11:46:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Bottom line </B>
</P>
<P>Methadone taken by mouth provided good pain relief for most adults with moderate or severe cancer pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Methadone has been used for many years as one of a number of different pain killers for cancer pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In this updated review we set out to estimate how well methadone worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were &#8211; for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their methadone.</P>
<P>In May 2016, we found just six studies with 388 adult participants. The studies were often small, and compared different preparations.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>For pain relief there did not seem to be much difference between methadone and morphine. For most people pain was reduced from moderate or severe to mild or no pain with methadone. Methadone is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly sleepiness, constipation, and dry mouth. These can be severe enough to stop people taking methadone. No data were available about the use of methadone in children.</P>
<P>We would like to see more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include information on unwanted effects and the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels, that is, no worse than mild pain, so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The quality of the evidence was low or very low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-07 13:52:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This is an updated review originally published in 2004 and first updated in 2007. This version includes substantial changes to bring it in line with current methodological requirements. Methadone is a synthetic opioid that presents some challenges in dose titration and is recognised to cause potentially fatal arrhythmias in some patients. It does have a place in therapy for people who cannot tolerate other opioids but should be initiated only by experienced practitioners. This review is one of a suite of reviews on opioids for cancer pain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-08-07 12:28:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of methadone as an analgesic in adults and children with cancer pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-31 11:46:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and clinicaltrials.gov, to May 2016, without language restriction. We also checked reference lists in relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-25 11:23:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought randomised controlled trials comparing methadone (any formulation and by any route) with active or placebo comparators in people with cancer pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-31 11:46:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All authors agreed on studies for inclusion. We retrieved full texts whenever there was any uncertainty about eligibility. One review author extracted data, which were checked by another review author. There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis. We extracted information on the effect of methadone on pain intensity or pain relief, the number or proportion of participants with 'no worse than mild pain'. We looked for data on withdrawal and adverse events. We looked specifically for information about adverse events relating to appetite, thirst, and somnolence. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We revisited decisions made in the earlier version of this review and excluded five studies that were previously included. We identified one new study for this update. This review includes six studies with 388 participants. We did not identify any studies in children.</P>
<P>The included studies differed so much in their methods and comparisons that no synthesis of results was feasible. Only one study (103 participants) specifically reported the number of participants with a given level of pain relief, in this case a reduction of at least 20% - similar in both the methadone and morphine groups. Using an outcome of 'no worse than mild pain', methadone was similar to morphine in effectiveness, and most participants who could tolerate methadone achieved 'no worse than mild pain'. Adverse event withdrawals with methadone were uncommon (12/202) and similar in other groups. Deaths were uncommon except in one study where the majority of participants died, irrespective of treatment group. For specific adverse events, somnolence was more common with methadone than with morphine, while dry mouth was more common with morphine than with methadone. None of the studies reported effects on appetite.</P>
<P>We judged the quality of evidence to be low, downgraded due to risk of bias and sparse data. For specific adverse events, we considered the quality of evidence to be very low, downgraded due to risk of bias, sparse data, and indirectness, as surrogates for appetite, thirst and somnolence were used.</P>
<P>There were no data on the use of methadone in children.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on low-quality evidence, methadone is a drug that has similar analgesic benefits to morphine and has a role in the management of cancer pain in adults. Other opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are easier to manage but may be more expensive than methadone in many economies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the second update of the review entitled 'Methadone for Cancer Pain' first published in 2004, and updated in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2007</LINK>). This version includes substantial changes to bring it in line with current methodological requirements for Cochrane reviews. This review is one of a suite of reviews on opioids for cancer pain.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-31 11:33:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer-related pain is a common problem. Worldwide prevalence data almost two decades ago suggested that there were 17 million people living with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1998</LINK>). Assessments of the prevalence of pain from nationwide studies in different countries have revealed consistent results, indicating that 30% to 40% of patients in active therapy experience pain, with this rate increasing to 70% to 90% in patients with advanced and progressive disease. Van den Beuken-van Everdingen estimated a prevalence of pain in excess of 50% for patients at all stages and with all types of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Beuken_x002d_van-Everdingen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Beuken-van Everdingen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cancer-related pain may be caused by the tumour pressing on adjacent organs/tissues, or by the tumour invading the tissue and damaging it.</P>
<P>Pain has a significant impact on function. Uncontrolled pain is incompatible with satisfactory quality of existence and it is well recognised that persistent pain impairs daily life and social interaction. Studies highlight the increased risk of anxiety, depression and even suicidal ideation in patients with uncontrolled pain (<LINK REF="REF-Graner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graner 2016</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methadone is a synthetic opioid in the structural class of diphenylpropylamines, which was developed in the 1930s. It is a potent agonist at the mu-opioid and delta-opioid receptors. The high affinity of methadone for mu-receptors (key mediators in supra-spinal analgesia) and delta-receptors (probably important in spinal analgesia) has resulted in it being recommended for use as an analgesic in cancer pain.</P>
<P>Most clinical practice and research in most countries uses a racaemic mixture of two isomers, levorotatory (L) methadone and dextrorotatory (D) methadone, although in Germany L-methadone alone is used (<LINK REF="REF-Bruera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruera 2002</LINK>). L-methadone is 8 to 50 times more potent than D-methadone in humans and is believed to be almost entirely responsible for its analgesic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Fainsinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fainsinger 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methadone is available as a lipophilic hydrochloride salt and is available as formulations for oral, rectal and parenteral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Fainsinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fainsinger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripamonti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripamonti 1997</LINK>). It is well absorbed by all routes. Oral administration is followed by rapid gastrointestinal absorption with measurable plasma levels at 30 minutes. The peak plasma levels after an oral dose occur at four hours and begin to decline 24 hours after dosing. Oral bioavailability is high, generally over 85% (79% ± 21 in studies). The recommended dose to be given parenterally is between 50% and 80% of the oral dose (<LINK REF="REF-Gannon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gannon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). Although local toxicity associated with subcutaneous administration has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bruera-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruera 1991</LINK>), in many cases this is manageable (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Elimination of methadone is mediated by hepatic oxidative biotransformation, renal N-demethylation, and urinary and faecal clearance. Chronic administration results in increased metabolite to methadone ratios, suggesting that autoinduction of hepatic microsomal enzymes occurs. Renal impairment is not thought to impair clearance; methadone may be useful in the management of pain in patients with renal failure. Some drug interactions are significant (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methadone has also been demonstrated in animal studies to have antagonist activity at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, resulting in interest in the clinical application of the drug in neuropathic pain syndromes. A combination of NMDA receptor antagonism and opioid agonism might provide valuable analgesic effects with fewer side effects than other analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Gorman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Single dose studies have shown potency marginally greater than morphine; repeated administration results in greater potency. Methadone's properties of high oral bioavailability, rapid onset of analgesic effect, long half-life (resulting in infrequent dosing schedules), lack of active metabolites, low rate of induction of tolerance, and low cost are characteristics that result in its use in the management of pain in cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fainsinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fainsinger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanks 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twycross-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twycross 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The perceived drawbacks of methadone include high potential for accumulation leading to delayed toxicity, highly variable pharmacokinetics between individuals, relative ease of use of modified-release morphine preparations, possible drug interactions, and concerns over dose titration and conversion from other opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Fainsinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fainsinger 1993</LINK>). Potential side effects of methadone include constipation, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hypotension, miosis (constriction of pupils), antidiuresis, exacerbation of asthma, and respiratory depression. Clinical situations where particular caution is advised include:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>use in the elderly;</LI>
<LI>pain only partially responsive to methadone, where there is a risk of rapid dose escalation;</LI>
<LI>pain thought to have a predominantly psychological component; and</LI>
<LI>people in whom sensitivity to low doses of opioids has previously been demonstrated.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Particular concern has grown in recent years about two aspects of methadone pharmacology: interactions with other drugs and also the potential for prolongation of the QT interval (a measure of cardiac function) resulting in the potentially fatal arrhythmia called torsade de pointes (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Beuken_x002d_van-Everdingen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Beuken-van Everdingen 2013</LINK>). Weschules, Bain and Richeimer (<LINK REF="REF-Weschules-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weschules 2008</LINK>) conducted a systematic review of the literature to quantify the available evidence relating to methadone-related drug interactions. They concluded that the evidence base was not well developed and much of the available literature consisted of case reports and case series considering inpatients being managed on methadone maintenance treatment programmes for opioid substance misuse. These patients had a high rate of HIV infection (and associated prescribing) and many of them were tobacco smokers with consequent potential induction of the cytochrome P1A2 enzyme, which may confound conclusions. Whilst the authors urge caution in extrapolating the findings of their review to the chronic and cancer pain patient populations, they draw attention to possible interactions of interest to pain management clinicians in a table summarising those attributed to interactions with anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine) and benzodiazepine anxiolytics (diazepam and alprazolam) (<LINK REF="REF-Weschules-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weschules 2008</LINK>). They also highlight concern that genetic polymorphism associated with the cytochrome-P enzymes may have a bearing on both methadone metabolism per se, and the occurrence - and potential severity - of methadone-related drug interactions.</P>
<P>Following reports of sudden death in people taking methadone in the early to mid 2000s, interest in prolongation of the QT interval by methadone has arisen. This risk has received specific attention in published guidance about use of methadone for pain in cancer and palliative care patients. For example, the editors of the Palliative Care Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-Twycross-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twycross 2014</LINK>) included a specific reference to methadone risks in the chapter on QT prolongation in the Fourth Edition which was not present in the Third edition. Cruciani reviewed the available literature in an attempt to answer the questions of whether, and when, ECG examination should be undertaken in patients prescribed methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2008</LINK>). From an examination of available studies published between 1973 and 2007, and considering the evidence in favour of performing ECG testing set against those that raise questions about the significance of cardiac toxicity related to methadone, it was concluded that there are reasons to be cautious and a low threshold for recommending ECG testing is advised. Pending further evidence, Cruciani's recommendations are that ECG examination should be conducted at baseline (methadone initiation), on dose escalation and on addition of relevant medication in the following situations:</P>
<OL>
<LI>patients co-administered methadone with drugs that are substrates of the cytochrome-P3A4 or cytochrome-P2D26 enzymes;</LI>
<LI>patients treated with drugs which may block the HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) protein in the potassium channel of cardiac tissue, including some macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin), antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone) and antidepressants (tricyclics and sertraline and venlafaxine);</LI>
<LI>patients who are medically frail or who have other risk factors for prolonged QT interval including cardiac disease, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and family history of sudden death.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The Palliative Care Formulary seeks to put this into a clinical context (<LINK REF="REF-Twycross-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twycross 2014</LINK>), also recommending baseline ECG and repeated ECG on dose titration or other relevant circumstances, with methadone discontinuation in favour of an alternative opioid being advocated if the QT interval is prolonged to greater than 500 ms. The authors do emphasise the need for clinical judgment over the balance of burden versus benefit when weighing the risk, and the importance of communication of this with the patient and those close to them.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methadone is considered to be a useful analgesic for the management of moderate to severe cancer pain. The earlier review in 2007 indicated that it had similar efficacy to morphine, but adverse events may be problematic with repeated dosing, based on limited evidence. Standards for systematic reviews have strengthened since then and it is important to identify any new studies and reassess the evidence for methadone's place in managing cancer pain.</P>
<P>This review is one of a suite of reviews on cancer pain and will be incorporated into an overview of opioids for cancer pain.</P>

<P>All authors assessed all included studies for risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, and resolved any disagreements by discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The effect of risk of bias for included studies is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process: random number table; computer random number generator); unclear risk of bias (method used to generate sequence not clearly stated). We excluded studies using a nonrandom process, which were therefore at high risk of bias (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions before assignment determines whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (telephone or central randomisation; consecutively-numbered sealed opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (method not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation, which were therefore at high risk of bias (open list).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessments (checking for possible performance and detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants, personnel, and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding: identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how blinding was achieved); high risk of bias (study not blinded).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). We assessed the risk of bias from missing data as: low risk of bias (ITT analysis, or all participants accounted for with adequate reasons for loss and equally distributed between groups); low risk of bias (minimal loss of data); unclear risk of bias (other issues, such as cross-over studies); high risk of bias (completer analysis, attrition 10% or more).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias). We assessed the risk of reporting bias as: low risk of bias (all intended outcomes reported); unclear risk of bias (any anomaly in reporting, such as participants contributing more than one set of data, or some outcomes not participant-reported); high risk of bias (prespecified outcome of interest not reported).</LI>
<LI>Size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies may overestimate treatment effects, probably because the conduct of small studies is more likely to be less rigorous, allowing critical criteria to be compromised. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they had 200 participants or more per treatment arm, at unclear risk if they had 50 to 200 participants per treatment arm, and at high risk if they had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Grading of evidence</HEADING>
<P>This section is taken from Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol recommended text. The overall quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE system, and presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, to present the main findings of a review in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, we included key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the main outcomes.</P>
<P>The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grade of evidence:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different;</LI>
<LI>Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We downgraded the evidence for:</P>
<OL>
<LI>serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality;</LI>
<LI>important inconsistency (-1);</LI>
<LI>some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness;</LI>
<LI>imprecise or sparse data (-1);</LI>

<P>In addition, where there were circumstances where the overall rating for a particular outcome needed to be adjusted as recommended by GRADE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013a</LINK>). For example, if there were so few data that the results were highly susceptible to the random play of chance, or if studies used last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation in circumstances where there were substantial differences in adverse event withdrawals, one would have no confidence in the result, and would need to downgrade the quality of the evidence by 3 levels, to very low quality. In circumstances where there were no data reported for an outcome, we would report the level of evidence as very low quality (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three studies (215 participants) compared oral methadone with oral morphine, modified-release (MR) (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2004</LINK> found that methadone at a daily dose of 15 mg was not superior to 60 mg/day of morphine MR. Pain reduction of at least 20% from baseline was the main pain outcome (methadone 24/49, morphine 30/54 at day 29). We judged this to be low-quality evidence because of the small size of the treatment groups. We could not derive data for 'no worse than mild pain'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 1998</LINK> reported mean pain scores that were just above 'no worse than mild pain' (See <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). In the second study by Mercadante (<LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>) similar mean pain scores were reported for participants who did not drop out (completer analysis). We judged this to be low-quality evidence because of the small size of the treatment groups, lack of blinding, and use of completer analysis in one study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Oral methadone compared with transdermal (TD) fentanyl</HEADING>
<P>In a three-arm study by <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>, there were no reported differences in pain intensity between the methadone and TD fentanyl groups for participants who did not drop out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Oral methadone compared with diamorphine and cocaine combination</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Twycross-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Twycross 1977 </LINK>compared methadone with a diamorphine-cocaine combination in 46 participants. The study examined the relative efficacy of the two interventions but no evaluable results were reported. Diamorphine-cocaine combinations are no longer used so the study is of historical interest only.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Specific adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The most frequently observed adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence, and constipation. We have separately presented adverse events relating to appetite, consciousness and thirst, as well as more general adverse events in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. No study reported the effects of the intervention on appetite. Sedation or somnolence was reported with both morphine and methadone; the results were inconsistent across studies, but the incidence was generally higher with methadone than with morphine. Dry mouth was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beaver-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Beaver 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ventafridda-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ventafridda 1986</LINK>), but again results were not consistent. Both morphine and methadone can produce a dry mouth and, by association, thirst. The majority of studies reported nausea, vomiting, and constipation.</P>
<P>We judged the quality of the evidence relating to adverse events as very low because of the small size of the studies, lack of blinding and use of completer analysis in some studies, the small number of events, and indirectness, since surrogates for appetite, thirst and somnolence (such as sedation, drowsiness and dry mouth) were used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Withdrawals due to adverse events, non compliance and death</HEADING>
<P>Adverse event withdrawals were uncommon (12/202) and similar between groups.</P>
<P>There were no recorded withdrawals for noncompliance.</P>
<P>Deaths were uncommon except in one study where the majority of participants died irrespective of the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Twycross-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Twycross 1977</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For studies in cancer pain, it is useful to know what proportion of people starting treatment are likely to be able to tolerate it, and what proportion of those who tolerate it are likely to obtain adequate pain relief. The studies did not report results in a way that unequivocally answered these questions.</P>
<P>Based on very limited amounts of data, there were no clear differences in participant-reported pain intensity or pain relief between methadone and morphine or transdermal fentanyl: similar proportions of participants were able to tolerate each drug and achieve a level of pain that was probably similar to mild pain. All six included studies were small, and in addition, three used methods that put them at risk of bias. The results must therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>We were not able to obtain reliable data on the numbers of participants who achieved no worse than mild pain.</P>
<P>Adverse events were typical for opioids (e.g. sedation, somnolence, dry mouth, constipation) but inconsistently reported.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the use of methadone in palliative care the amount of underpinning data is small. The most recent study is now eight years old and most studies were conducted before 2000. The more recent studies (251 participants randomised) compared methadone with either modified-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, which are commonly used in practice (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to carry out any subgroup analysis. In particular, we were unable to investigate the influence of dose and titration regimen on either efficacy or tolerability. Included studies were underpowered to investigate serious adverse events, including arrhythmias.</P>
<P>We did not identify any studies in children.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy for this updated review identified a systematic review conducted using Cochrane methods to examine the literature on methadone for cancer pain since the 2007 publication of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Good-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 2014</LINK>). The review authors identified four randomised controlled trials. One is included in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>). The other three were identified in our search strategy but have been allocated to the 'excluded studies' because they used methadone in combination with other agents (<LINK REF="STD-Lauretti-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lauretti 2013</LINK>), or did not compare methadone with a different comparator. One examined outcomes for participants on a stable dose of morphine, who were switched to methadone with or without acetaminophen (paracetamol) (<LINK REF="STD-Cubero-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cubero 2010</LINK>). Good pain control and improved side-effect burden and quality of life were reported, with a majority of participants expressing a preference for methadone treatment. However this was not a trial that examined methadone use in the way we defined for our review, which explains our decision to exclude it. The other study identified by <LINK REF="REF-Good-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 2014</LINK> compared two methods of switching to methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Moksnes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moksnes 2011</LINK>). Whilst interesting, the study addressed a different question from that considered by this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For patients with cancer pain</HEADING>
<P>There is limited evidence from RCTs that methadone is effective in managing severe pain due to cancer in adults. Given the issues of difficulties around titration to an effective dose and also the possibility of severe adverse effects (particularly cardiac arrhythmias), it is unlikely to have a role as the first line of treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For clinicians managing cancer pain</HEADING>
<P>Methadone is an opioid that has been used for many years to treat severe cancer pain although the evidence base from randomised controlled trials is sparse. If other opioids are not tolerated it may have a role, providing the issues of dose titration and possible severe adverse effects are considered. There is no information for use in paediatrics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-31 12:34:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General implications</HEADING>
<P>Research in this patient population is challenging, and no large, high-quality trials with well-managed bias have been conducted. A further consideration is the question of whether, with the increased concerns about the adverse effects of methadone on the prolongation of the QT interval, and greater recognition of significant methadone-related drug interaction, methadone is likely to be used more widely than at present, even with further research. While it would be easy to suggest that further research is needed, in practice this is very unlikely to happen as this is an old drug and funding is not likely to be forthcoming.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for study design</HEADING>
<P>The major problem with research involving methadone relates to its unique pharmacological characteristics. Repeated dose studies using methadone at fixed dose intervals is potentially hazardous in the early phase of pain management in a switch from another opioid, or when treating opioid-naive patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for measurement and outcomes</HEADING>
<P>As the distribution of response to analgesics is often bimodal, we strongly recommend the collection of dichotomous data in preference to mean pain scores. Data should be available to allow the estimation of the proportion of participants who achieve no worse than mild pain, defined as below 30 mm on a 100 mm VAS pain-intensity scale. Adverse events should always be reported but we advocate specific reporting of events affecting appetite, thirst and consciousness in line with the Neuberger report (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other considerations for future study design include:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>use of standard and comparable pain intensity scores, which would allow closer comparison between different studies and potentially meta-analysis;</LI>
<LI>inclusion of patient-reported pain and other data only;</LI>
<LI>larger numbers of participants in studies where differentiation by pain syndrome has been attempted in order to answer the question as to whether methadone is particularly valuable in bone or neuropathic pain or other syndromes;</LI>
<LI>patient satisfaction and quality of life appraisal.</LI>
