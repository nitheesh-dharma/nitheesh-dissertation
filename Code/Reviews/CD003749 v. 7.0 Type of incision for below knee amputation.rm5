<TITLE>Type of incision used for below knee amputation to create a skin flap that maximises healing</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-04 13:28:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Below knee amputation may be necessary for people with critical limb ischaemia caused by advanced vascular disease or diabetic foot infection (sepsis) where no other treatment option is possible. Keeping the knee joint gives a better chance of walking using an artificial leg or prosthesis and social independence after the amputation. The surgical technique is important. Bone and deep tissues are generally treated in a similar way but the type of skin incision varies between techniques. A skin flap is designed to go over the stump, where the main consideration is to maximise blood supply and healing. A long posterior skin flap and unequal (skewed) anterior and posterior muscle and skin (myocutaneous) flaps are most often used, although other techniques have been described.</P>
<P>Three randomised controlled studies were identified. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. They were reported on between 1977 and 1991 and involved a total of 309 participants. Each reported on different comparisons. Below knee amputation using skew flaps or sagittal flaps provided no advantage over the long posterior flap technique on primary stump healing, which approached 60% for all groups. In the third study, involving 30 participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure with delayed skin closure. Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.</P>
<P>Nearly all the surgeons in the study that looked at skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique were new to the skew flap operation and so were on a learning curve. Factors which might have influenced the findings include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and location of pre-existing surgical scars.</P>

<P>Three studies with a combined total of 309 participants were included in the review. One study compared two-stage versus one-stage BKA; one study compared skew flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA; and one study compared sagittal flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. BKA using skew flaps or sagittal flaps conferred no advantage over the well established long posterior flap technique (primary stump healing was 60% for both skew flaps and long posterior flap (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.42) and primary stump healing was 58% for sagittal flaps and 55% for long posterior flap (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.43). For participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by a definitive long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure (Peto OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89). Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation, and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-04 13:21:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to show a benefit of one type of incision over another. However, in the presence of wet gangrene a two-stage procedure leads to better primary stump healing compared to a one-stage procedure. The choice of amputation technique can, therefore, be a matter of surgeon preference taking into account factors such as previous experience of a particular technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and the location of pre-existing surgical scars.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-07 10:18:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-07 10:18:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-07 10:18:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Below knee amputation (BKA) has been increasingly used as a therapeutic option since the 1950s. This is in preference to above knee amputation, which has a more limited chance of achieving successful rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Silbert-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silbert 1950</LINK>). BKA is necessary for patients with advanced critical limb ischaemia who cannot be treated with reconstructive vascular surgery (to restore blood flow to the leg) or in whom vascular surgery has failed. It may also be necessary for patients with aggressive diabetic foot infections or gangrene, or both; for those with extensive venous ulceration; or following major trauma. Guidelines from the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and Ireland recommend that all patients undergo a vascular surgical assessment prior to amputation (<LINK REF="REF-VSSGBI-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">VSSGBI 1996</LINK>). The current quality improvement framework for major amputation surgery (<LINK REF="REF-VSGBI-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">VSGBI 2010</LINK>) aims to reduce the mortality rate post major amputation surgery to less than 5% by 2015 and states that "amputation for vascular disease and diabetes should only be undertaken after formal investigation to the arterial system by angiography (diagnostic conventional angiography (DSA), computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)) or specialist ultrasound imaging, except when the leg is clearly beyond salvage".</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-05 00:18:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of BKA are influenced by the surgical technique used. Most of the described operative techniques treat the bone and deep tissues in a similar way, although there may be some variation in the level of bone section and formation of the muscle flaps used to cover the bone ends. However, the type of skin incision varies between techniques. The main consideration in designing a skin flap is to maximise its blood supply in order that healing may occur. The 'gold standard' BKA is the long posterior flap as popularised by Burgess (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1968a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1968a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1968b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1968b</LINK>), see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. The rationale behind this technique is that the poorly vascularised anterior skin flap is compensated by the relatively well vascularised posterior skin flap (<LINK REF="REF-Chavatzas-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavatzas 1975</LINK>). Robinson showed in an uncontrolled study that 69% of patients treated by a long posterior flap walked with a prosthetic limb (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1976</LINK>). Numerous alternative techniques have been described. These include unequal anterior and posterior myocutaneous (muscle and skin) flaps (<LINK REF="REF-Haimovici-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haimovici 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1995</LINK>); equal anterior and posterior myocutaneous flaps (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 1981</LINK>); equal medial (inner side of leg) and lateral (outer side of leg) flaps (that is sagittal) (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Persson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persson 1974</LINK>); a 'laterally based' skin flap (<LINK REF="REF-Catre-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catre 1997</LINK>); and creation of a broad posterior flap with burying of the ends of the flap (after removal of the outer skin layer) to provide extra padding for the stump (<LINK REF="REF-Galvao-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galvao 1975</LINK>). The 'skew' flap technique reported by Robinson (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) is widely considered to be superior to the long posterior flap in terms of wound healing and time to full mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1991</LINK>). The aim of this review was to assess the evidence supporting the use of these techniques.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-15 12:44:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Careful judgement is required in patient selection and decision making about the amputation level in order to maximise the rehabilitation potential. There is no doubt that preservation of the knee joint leads to improved function and social independence, with one report suggesting that 87% of previously mobile patients with peripheral arterial disease could maintain independent ambulation after BKA (<LINK REF="REF-Pinzur-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinzur 1993</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-05 00:20:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. The main findings from previous versions of the review were that the choice of amputation technique has no effect on outcome and can, therefore, be a simple matter of surgeon preference. Factors which might influence this finding include previous experience of a particular technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and the location of pre-existing surgical scars. An update of the review was conducted to identify any new evidence since the publication of the last version of this review.</P>

<P>Three studies were included in the review. Duration of recruitment ranged from 28 to 30 months and the study follow-up was two months in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK>), six months in a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK>) and a mean (range) of 11.7 months (3.5 to 22 months) in the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Termansen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Termansen 1977</LINK>). All were parallel trials. Participants, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes are described in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. The studies examined three comparisons: two-stage versus one-stage long posterior flap BKA (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK>); skew flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA (<LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK>); and sagittal flaps BKA versus long posterior flaps BKA (<LINK REF="STD-Termansen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Termansen 1977</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK> also included participants undergoing above knee amputation (AKA) but these data were excluded from the analyses of this review.</P>

<P>Tests for heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were not possible in this review as each comparison related to a single study only.</P>
<P>One study compared two-stage BKA (a guillotine amputation at the ankle as the primary procedure followed by a long posterior flap BKA with primary skin closure as a secondary procedure) with one-stage BKA (long posterior flap BKA with delayed skin closure) in 30 participants with wet gangrene of the foot (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK>). There was significantly better (100%) primary stump healing in the two-stage group than in the one-stage group (Peto OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89). There was no difference between the two groups in post-operative infection rate, reamputation at the same level, or reamputation at a higher level. Mobility with a prosthetic limb was 47% in the two-stage group and 54% in the one-stage group. This was not statistically different (Peto OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.78). Mean length of hospital stay was 44 days in the two-stage group and 67 days in the one-stage group. Statistical analysis could not be applied to this length of stay as the standard deviation of hospital stay was not given in the paper. See <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> Comparison 1.</P>
<P>The Joint Vascular Research Group (JVRG) study randomised 191 participants in 11 vascular centres to skew flaps BKA (n = 98) or long posterior flap BKA (n = 93) (<LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK>). There was no difference in primary stump healing between the two groups (60% for both the skew flaps and long posterior flap) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.42). The rates of post-operative wound necrosis, reamputation at the same level, and reamputation at a higher level were again no different between the groups. Thirty-day mortality and number of participants fitted with a prosthetic limb were not different between the groups. Mobility with a prosthetic limb was 60% in the skew flaps group and 49% in the long posterior flap group, although this was not statistically different (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.58). Mean length of hospital stay was 36 days in the skew flaps group and 42 days in the long posterior flap group. Statistical analysis could not be applied as the standard deviation of hospital stay was not given in the paper. See <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> Comparison 2.</P>
<P>The last study compared 41 participants treated with sagittal flaps BKA to 47 participants with a long posterior flap (<LINK REF="STD-Termansen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Termansen 1977</LINK>). There was no difference in primary stump healing between the two groups (58% for sagittal flaps, 55% for long posterior flap) (Peto OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.43). The rates of reamputation at the same level, reamputation at a higher level, and mortality after three months were no different between the two groups. Overall percentages of participants fitted with a prosthetic limb were 78% in the sagittal flaps group and 72% in the long posterior flap group, although this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). Numbers of participants mobilising with a prosthetic limb were not stated. However, the study quoted numbers of participants fitted with a patellar tendon-bearing prosthesis, which one would normally associate with good mobility: 44% in the sagittal flaps group compared to 55% in the long posterior flap group (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22). See <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> Comparison 3.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-05 01:01:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only a limited number of trials were identified which addressed these important issues. The most important question to be answered was whether the skew flap technique conferred any advantage over the long posterior flap amputation in terms of primary stump healing, reamputation rate and return to full mobility with a prosthetic limb. The single multicentre Joint Vascular Research Group (JVRG) study addressed this issue and found no significant difference between the two techniques in all outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK>). It could be concluded from this study that the choice of technique is a matter of surgeon preference.</P>
<P>There was no difference in primary stump healing, rates of reamputation at the same level, reamputation at a higher level, and mobility after three months between sagittal flaps and the long posterior flap (<LINK REF="STD-Termansen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Termansen 1977</LINK>). A higher percentage of participants were fitted with prosthetic limb in the sagittal flaps group than in the long posterior flap group (78% versus 72%), however more patellar tendon-bearing prostheses were fitted in the latter group (44% versus 55%) (<LINK REF="STD-Termansen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Termansen 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the presence of wet gangrene, there was significantly better (100%) primary stump healing in the two-stage group than in the one-stage group, although there was no difference between the two groups in post-operative infection rate, reamputation at the same level, or reamputation at a higher level (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK>). Mobility with a prosthetic limb was higher in the one-stage group (54% versus 47%) however this was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mobility with a prosthetic limb following below knee amputation (BKA) appears relatively consistent between studies, at 47% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Pinzur-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinzur 1993</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-05 01:02:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three included studies were published more than 20 years ago. As indicated in the <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for practice</LINK> section below, in modern vascular surgery both skew flaps and long posterior flap below knee amputations continue to be used. Length of stay data quoted in the included studies look to be outside what would now be deemed acceptable in modern clinical practice as the limiting factor for discharge is often social care rather than a requirement for inpatient medical care.</P>
<P>One could conclude from <LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK> that the choice of technique is a matter of surgeon preference. However, nearly all the members of the JVRG group were new to the skew flap operation and were therefore on a learning curve, which may have influenced the results.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-05 01:05:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall body of evidence to support one surgical technique over another for BKA is limited to three studies which are different in their scope. Overall, there is a low risk of selection bias in two out of the three studies; unclear risk of bias for blinding and incomplete outcome data; and low risk for selective reporting and any other sources of bias. Therefore, the overall strength of the evidence could be considered as 'moderate'.</P>

<P>To the review authors' knowledge no other evidence has addressed this issue.</P>
<P>The type of prosthesis used was not mentioned by <LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1991</LINK>. Trial participants would have accessed different limb fitting centres that would have decided which prosthesis was appropriate for an individual patient. Mobility with a prosthetic limb following BKA appears relatively consistent between studies, at 47% to 60%, and this appears to reflect current clinical practice. This contrasts with the report from Pinzur which suggests that 87% of participants could maintain independent ambulation following BKA (<LINK REF="REF-Pinzur-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinzur 1993</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-05 01:11:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sagittal flaps below knee amputation is seldom used in clinical practice. There is no evidence that this confers any advantage to the long posterior flap technique. The main question in clinical practice is whether the skew flaps technique improves the outcome compared with the long posterior flap. The single multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) that was identified demonstrated no obvious benefit of one technique over the other. We conclude that there is no evidence to show a benefit of one technique over the other except in the presence of wet gangrene, where a two-stage procedure has a benefit of better primary stump healing over a one-stage procedure. Factors which might influence the choice of one technique versus the other include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and the location of pre-existing surgical scars, for example from a previous vascular reconstruction.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-05 01:11:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A further RCT comparing skew flaps to the long posterior flap, involving surgeons with experience of both techniques, should be considered. This would negate the possible effects of a learning curve, which might have influenced the JVRG study.</P>
