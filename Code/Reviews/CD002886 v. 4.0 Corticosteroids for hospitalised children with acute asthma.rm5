Also please add study design (parallel or crossover), location and number of patients in each arm,  inclusion criteria, interventions and contol Rx given, duration of trial and timing of outcome assessment.&lt;br&gt;Have a look at the tables for some of the other reviews to get a feel for this please (eg Holding Chambers v Nebulisers for Beta agonists in acute asthma).&lt;br&gt;GREAT - LOOKS MUCH BETTER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Comparison 1, Outcome 1 and 20,21 {1#1 and 20,21,25}; please switch of totals as this is data from a single study and is therefore not a pooled result so totals should be off anyway. The control for this is found by selecting the outcome and then clicking the edit button on the toolbar. The window that comes up has 3 tabs and the middle one allows totals to be switched on or off for the outcome.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;{1#5, 1#8-19,22,23,26,27,29 } single study so switch off total please.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;{1#6} SD for treatment group in Younger is very small - is this correct or should it be 13 rather than 3?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;{1,29} Title has supplementary with an i instead of an e in the spelling.

Could you also change the labels to read favours Prednisolone or Favours Budesonide as the reader cannot easily tell which is treatment and which is control. The graph labels are found under the third tab of the edit window for the outcome.&lt;br&gt;THANKS FOR CHANGING SOME OF THE YOUNGER DATA FOR LENGTH OF STAY WHICH NOW USED SD, BUT FEV1 AND FEF ARE STILL USING SEM NOT SD AND SO IS PULMONARY INDEX WHICH IS NOT WELL EXTRACTED FOR TIME POINTS FROM THE GRAPH IN THE PAPER AND NEEDS REDOING.&lt;br&gt;ALSO THE LABELS FRO OUTCOME 2 NEED REVERSING FOR BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES PLEASE, IN FACT THE COMPARISON NEEDS TO BE RENAMED NEBULISED BUDESONIDE V ORAL PREDNISOLONE AS I THINK THAT THE BUD RESULTS ARE REPORTED FIRST AND THEN THE LABELS FOR TREATMENT AND COMPARISON SHOULD BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THIS BEFORE THE LABELS FOR DIRECTION OF EFFECT ARE RECHECKED!&lt;br&gt;Synopsis:- &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Could you add a single summary sentence to this synopsis please. (As a first line with a gap below)&lt;br&gt;THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: -&lt;br&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Main results - &lt;br&gt;Seven trials were included with a total of 426 children studied (274 with oral prednisone vs. placebo, 106 with intravenous steroids vs. placebo and 46 with inhaled budesonide vs. prednisolone).   The data were sparse and pooled results were not possible for many important outcomes. The results show that treating acute severe asthma with systemic steroids in children may result in improved clinical severity scores that increase over time in hospital. There were significant differences at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours. At 36 hours the pooled WMD for improved scores was 4.2 (95% CI: 2.96 to 5.44).  A significant number of steroid treated children were discharged at the first assessment after admission (&amp;gt;4 hours) with an OR of 7.00 (95% CI: 2.98 to 16.45). There were no consistent or clinically important improvements in hospital length of stay in the children treated with steroids. Similarly there were no differences between groups in pulmonary function or oxygen saturation measurements. However, children treated with steroids in hospital were less likely to relapse within one to three months with an OR = 0.19 (95%CI: 0.07 to 0.55). The one study that compared inhaled budesonide with oral prednisone showed only small improvements in the inhaled group.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It is group policy not to report the result of single studies as these are not pooled results.  This section needs a re-write please. The clinical severity scores are for one study so please remove these. Length of stay is 9 hours less and should be reported as such since it is statistically significant. The clinical relevance may be discussed later.  The one study comparing inhaled to systemic steroids did not show a difference but is underpowered to reliably detect important differences in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;THIS READS MUCH BETTER BUT I WOULD STILL BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN REPORTING NO DIFFERENCE WHEN THE STUDY IS TOO SMALL.&lt;br&gt;METHODS&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;then SE (Xbar) can be calculated thus&lt;br&gt;SE (Xbar) = (Xbar  - LL) / 1.96orSE(Xbar) = (UL - Xbar) / 1.96&lt;br&gt;where LL and UL = lower and upper limit of CI&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;This is only strictly true is the number of patients is large, for 23 patients the t-score will not be the same as the Z-score so your SE will be rather smaller than you have calculated.  &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In the Gleeson 1990 study, the median length of stay for each group was approximated as means although the ranges were large.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;How did you derive SDs from the Gleeson study (presumably the data was skewed hence use of medians)?&lt;br&gt;IT APPEARS THAT THE RANGES HAVE BEEN DIVIDED BY 4 TO PRODUCE A STANDARD ERROR THAT HAS BEEN ENTERED AS A STANDARD DEVIATION IN REVMAN. THIS IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY!! I THINK YOU WOULD BE SAFER TO IMPUTE STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM THE OTHER TWO STUDIES IN THIS CASE (EG MAKE BOTH SDs 30 AND EXPLAIN THIS IS THE TEXT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;1. LENGTH OF STAY&lt;br&gt;Discharge at first re-exam (&amp;gt;4h)&lt;br&gt;This outcome was used by two studies (Connett 1994; Storr 1987) as a measure of effectiveness.  Both Storr 1987(OR =3.83; 95%CI: 1.28 to 11.44) and Connett 1994 (OR=15.11; 95%CI: 3.37 to 67.67) showed a significant difference between treatment and control groups, indicating that treatment groups were more likely to be discharged at first re-examination than the control groups.  The pooled results of these studies were also significant (OR = 7.00; 95%CI: 2.98 to 16.45) in favour of treatment.   The test for heterogeneity between these studies was non significant (p=0.14).  &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Have you considered reporting this as NNT as well as OR (the latter being hard to understand by clinicians)?  In this case the NNT would be 3 (95% CI 2 to 8) calculated using Visual Rx at www.nntonline.net using the OR and its CI and the CER of 8/106.&lt;br&gt;GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hospital length of stay&lt;br&gt;There was no significant difference in the length of stay in Ho 1994 (2.18 d vs. 2.50 d). The median length of stay in the Gleeson 1990 trial for the steroid group (54 hours; range 41 to 100 hours) vs. (64 hours; range 39 to 176 hours) in the placebo group. This was not statistically significant. However, length of stay in hours in the Younger 1987 study was significantly lower in the corticosteroid treatment group (WMD= -9.00 hours; 95%CI: -12.80 to  -5.20). The pooled result of the above studies was (WMD = -8.99; 95%CI: -12.60 to -5.37) in favour of treating with steroids. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;You will notice that the SD for the Younger study is totally out of keeping with the other two studies and I wonder if this is actually a Standard Error not an SD. Could you check the paper please.&lt;br&gt;GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Younger 1987 reported pulmonary index at 12, 24 and 36 hours and found that the treatment group's was significantly higher at all three stages with the difference and the significance level increasing at each stage 12 HR WMD=1.5 (95%CI: 0.26 to 2.74), 24 HR WMD=2.00 (95%CI: 0.58 to 3.42), AND 36 HR WMD=4.2 (95%CI: 2.96 to 5.44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kattan 1980 reported a trend in improving clinical scores between treatment and control groups. This difference was only significant after 48 hours treatment (WMD= 1.91; 95%CI: 0.15 to 3.67). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Single studies so please remove. Also many of the lung functions that are single study results should not be reported in the results.&lt;br&gt;THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;% Predicted PEFR&lt;br&gt;There was no significant difference between the control and treatment groups in % predicted PEFR at 12 or 36 hours according to the Younger 1987 data (WMD=7.5; 95%CI: -3.58 to 18.58) (12h), (WMD=6.00; 95%CI: -5.08 to 17.08) (36h).  However, the difference between the groups is borderline significance at 24 hours (WMD=14.00; 95%CI: -0.12 to 28.12).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;This is not statistically significant.&lt;br&gt;THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;5. RELAPSE RATE FOLLOWING DISCHARGE&lt;br&gt;Both Connett 1994 and Storr 1987 found there were no re-referrals with acute asthma in the two weeks following the study treatment. Ho 1994 did not find exacerbations in either group in the one week following the treatment.   Younger (Younger 1987) investigated relapse rate (number of patients) within four weeks and Gleeson (Gleeson 1990) counted relapsed patients within three months.  Younger (Younger 1987) showed that the treatment group were less likely to relapse within this time and although this result is not significant it is extremely close to significance (OR=0.19; 95%CI: 0.03 to 1.01).  Gleeson 1990's results also show that patients in the treatment group were significantly less likely to relapse within three months of discharge (OR=0.19; 95%CI: 0.05 to 0.76).  The combined effects of these two studies shows relapse rate to be significantly lower in the treatment groups (OR=0.19; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.55).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Again an NNT could be useful here.  NNT of 3 (95% CI 2 to 7) need to be given systemic steroids to prevent one relapse at one to three months.&lt;br&gt;GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;28_5_02 Sent back to Toby to pass on to Mike Smith and Brian Rowe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10/1/2003 Sign off by CJC&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the work done on this review. I have re-entered the Matthews data to match the paper (there is a typo for one of the change scores identified from the reported p value and several of the others had been entered incorrectly). The Younger SDs now look much better as does the imputed Gleeson SD. &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;INHALED STEROIDS VS SYSTEMIC STEROIDS&lt;br&gt;Matthews 1999 reported that the severity of shortness of breath decreased more in the patients who received budesonide than those receiving prednisolone (WMD=-0.77; 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.20). However, there were no significant differences in  cough or wheeze, or in measures of pulmonary function such as FEV1, PEFR, FVC or oxygen saturation between the nebulised budesonide and prednisolone groups.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;The above para has been changed to match the metaview results now they have been correctly entered from the paper.  The graph labels for comparison 2 are also now correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send to Toby for Paul today - this is ready for peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE USE THIS VERSION AS I HAVE SPELL CHECKED IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:10:30 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="CCH-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="4.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>An acute asthma attack in a child often results in a trip to the hospital. In the emergency department steroid drugs are given which may improve the child's condition and allow them to be sent home after a few hours observation. However, some children require continued treatment in hospital. This review asked the question "do steroid drugs help children admitted to hospital with asthma?" We found that steroids given by mouth or through an intravenous tube help children recover from acute asthma. The benefits may include earlier discharge or a shorter stay in hospital. Children were less likely to come back to hospital in the one to three months following the admission. However, the evidence was not overwhelming due to the limited number of studies available and different medicines used. Further research needs to concentrate on the best medications to use and the best route of administration. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Systemic corticosteroids are used routinely in the management of children with severe acute asthma. There is a lack of consensus regarding the agent, dose and route of corticosteroid administration.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the benefit of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) compared to placebo and inhaled steroids in acute paediatric asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>All controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Register, hand searching of respiratory journals, reference lists and contacts with experts and pharmaceutical companies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they described a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving children aged 1-18 years with severe acute asthma who received oral, inhaled, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids. Only studies in which patients required hospital admission were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers using a standard form extracted all data. All data, numeric calculations and graphic extrapolations were independently confirmed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven trials were included with a total of 426 children studied (274 with oral prednisone vs. placebo, 106 with intravenous steroids vs placebo and 46 with nebulised budesonide vs prednisolone). A significant number of steroid treated children were discharged early after admission (&gt;4 hours) with an OR of 7.00 (95% CI: 2.98 to 16.45) and NNT of 3 (95%CI: 2 to 8). The length of stay was shorter in the steroid groups with a WMD of -8.75 hours (95% CI: -19.23 to 1.74). There were no significant differences between groups in pulmonary function or oxygen saturation measurements. Children treated with steroids in hospital were less likely to relapse within one to three months with OR 0.19 (95%CI: 0.07 to 0.55) and NNT of 3 (95%CI: 2 to 7). The single small study that compared nebulised budesonide to oral prednisone failed to demonstrate equivalence or a difference between each therapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Systemic corticosteroids produce some improvements for children admitted to hospital with acute asthma. The benefits may include earlier discharge and fewer relapses. Inhaled or nebulised corticosteroids cannot be recommended as equivalent to systemic steroids at this time. Further studies examining differing doses and routes of administration for corticosteroids will clarify the optimal therapy.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:09:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Despite the significant improvements in asthma treatment over the past several decades, children are commonly hospitalised with acute flare-ups of this chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Homer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-To-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">To 1996</LINK>). Corticosteroids are one of the cornerstones of therapy for acute asthma; however, the corticosteroid doses, delivery and agents used in the therapy of acute paediatric asthma vary considerably. </P>
<P>For many years, corticosteroids in acute childhood asthma were considered controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Weinburger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinburger 1988</LINK>). Much of the research in this area suffered with methodological problems such as inadequate study design and differing populations. However, recent clinical trials in children have shown a beneficial effect of corticosteroids when they are used early in acute asthma. Much of the research in acute asthma has been performed in the emergency setting. The main benefit reported in these studies is up to a 27% reduction in hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>). In this study of 140 patients, prednisone was compared with a placebo and resulted in a discharge rate of 30% from the emergency department compared with 3% in the placebo group. Intramuscular methylprednisolone has also been found to be useful in very young children with acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Tal-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tal 1990</LINK>). The benefits of this steroid were observed within 3 hours of administration. Similar benefits were also seen in a study completed by <LINK REF="REF-Scarfone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scarfone 1993</LINK> with a range of paediatric age groups receiving oral prednisolone or placebo. In this study there was an 18% reduction in admission rate in the treated group. When combined, these studies suggest that steroid treatment in the emergency department results in a reduced hospital admission as well as improved symptom scores (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000a</LINK>). Furthermore, another Cochrane review that included both adults and children concluded that a short course of systemic corticosteroids after an emergency visit for acute asthma reduces relapses and decreases beta-agonist use (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000b</LINK>). Finally, inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency setting have also been shown to provide some reduction in admissions in severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>In ambulatory clinic settings, oral corticosteroids have been used to avoid progression to severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1983</LINK>). In addition, there has been considerable work on using inhaled steroids to prevent viral induced asthma attacks (<LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doull-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doull 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svedmyr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svedmyr 1999</LINK>). These studies demonstrate that in mild, episodic asthma presenting to a clinic, high dose inhaled steroids minimise wheezing episodes and possibly reduce the need for oral steroids. It is unclear whether, these medications reduce the hospitalisation rate of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-McKean-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKean 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Research into the pathophysiology of acute asthma has clarified the significant role of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1993</LINK>). Corticosteroids reduce the production of many mediators released during the inflammatory process and inhibit the many cells that are activated including macrophages, monocytes, T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and airway epithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Djukanovic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djukanovic 1992</LINK>). Corticosteroids may also decrease microvascular leakage and mucus secretion in irritated airways (<LINK REF="REF-Boschetto-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boschetto 1991</LINK>). Additionally, corticosteroids improve the effectiveness of beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Svedmyr-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svedmyr 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although it is generally accepted and recommended that corticosteroids be initiated or continued when a child is hospitalised with acute asthma, there are still questions regarding the extent of the clinical benefit derived from this therapy. There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal dose, frequency and route of steroid for those children who are affected most severely by this disease. It would therefore be useful to examine the studies that have assessed steroid treatment in children beyond the initial assessment in the emergency room or ambulatory setting. Only one previous review has been completed in this topic area, and that addressed a similar question in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2000</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The overall objective was to determine the clinical outcomes of children treated with corticosteroids when hospitalised with severe acute asthma. The two specific objectives are:<BR/>1. Compare systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) with placebo;<BR/>2. Compare systemic corticosteroids with inhaled steroids.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies that were described as randomised controlled trials (RCT) were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies involving children aged 1-18 years with severe acute asthma defined by history, doctor's diagnosis, response to initial treatment, spirometry or peak flow were considered. Only studies where patients were treated in an emergency or outpatient department and required hospital admission have been included. Studies that included patients on pre-existing oral corticosteroids were not included. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies that reported results of patient's who were randomised to receive oral, inhaled, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids were divided into the following comparisons:<BR/>1. Systemic corticosteroids versus placebo (and include standard care with bronchodilators);<BR/>2. Systemic corticosteroids versus inhaled steroids.</P>
<P>Data on co-interventions were collected including information regarding additional therapy such as beta-agonists, anti-cholinergics, theophylline compounds, antibiotics, oxygen.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Given the limitations of paediatric studies, any of the following clinically relevant outcomes were included: <BR/>1. length of stay<BR/>2. symptom scores; <BR/>3. pulmonary function testing (Peak expiratory flows {PEF} and forced expiratory volume in 1 second {FEV1}; absolute and percent predicted) when performed;<BR/>4. duration of oxygen therapy; <BR/>5. relapse rates following discharge;<BR/>6. bronchodilator use (number of treatments per 24 hour period);<BR/>7. adverse effects.</P>
<P>To be included, all studies required a minimum follow-up of 24 hours. </P>

Data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>) were not reported in tables but demonstrated in charts. To extract these data values scaled grids were produced on acetate and date points traced onto these; results were checked for reliability twice.

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:08:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The included trials were single-centre RCT's from the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>), US (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>) was a multi-center study encompassing 9 centres from around the UK.</P>
<P>POPULATION STUDIED:<BR/>Some of the studies examined children with a mean age of 5 years (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>) and the others (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>) examined children predominantly in the school age. This is an important distinction as the younger ages are unlikely to provide pulmonary function data and the outcomes are more often determined by clinical assessment. All studies dealt with acute asthma; however, many did not include children who were seriously ill with asthma who were likely to go on to require intensive care. Some studies were explicit in this exclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>) and for others this was inferred from the clinical information.</P>
<P>Previous corticosteroid use was reported in most studies to a varying degree. All studies excluded patients currently using oral corticosteroids. Inhaled steroids were an excluding characteristic for some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>). The remaining studies allowed prophylactic inhaled steroids in their study and this ranged from 3% (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>) to 33% (<LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>) of subjects. This possibly reflects the variability in acceptance and use of prophylactic inhaled steroids in this time period.</P>
<P>All studies included children who were initially assessed in an emergency setting and admitted with acute severe asthma. All had been treated with an initial protocol (which varied with each institution) and admitted because of their failure to improve. Some of these protocols were very specific and admission was based on a poor response to therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>) and others indicated that admission was based largely on clinical grounds. None of the studies used peak flow as a guide to admission.</P>
<P>INTERVENTIONS:<BR/>Three studies used oral prednisolone in three different doses (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>). In each of these studies, only one dose was given on admission. In four studies intravenous steroids were administered. The <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK> study used hydrocortisone 7 mg/kg/day. In the <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK> study intravenous hydrocortisone was given initially as a loading dose (6 mg/kg) followed by 2 mg/kg for at least 24 hours before being converted to oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day. In <LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK> intravenous methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg was given initially followed by 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for the duration of the intravenous therapy. Only one study was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>) that investigated the use of nebulised budesonide (2 mg every 8 hours) and compared this with two days of oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day).</P>
<P>CO-INTERVENTIONS:<BR/>All studies used nebulised bronchodilators as part of the treatment of acute asthma. The usual medication was salbutamol either as 0.15 mg/kg or a set 5 mg dose. Terbutaline was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>). The dose interval varied according to the clinical response and ranged between every 2 hours up to 3 times per day. In <LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK> study salbutamol was given frequently (every 30 minutes with prednisolone or placebo) or infrequently (every 1-4 hours with prednisolone or placebo). Some studies used intravenous aminophylline (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>) and other bronchodilators (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>OUTCOMES:<BR/>Precise outcome measurement of acute asthma in children is difficult. Therefore, it is not surprising that the outcomes were reported variably in these trials; there are no consistent outcomes for a combined analysis. In two studies the percentage of children discharged at the first assessment (4-5 hours) was used as a measure of the steroid effect (<LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>). Length of stay in hospital was used in the remainder of the studies. Most studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>) used symptom scores or pulmonary indexes as a measure to determine outcome. Unfortunately many of the scores differed in content or were assessed at different time points. Pulmonary function testing was limited by the ages of the patients studied and therefore only completed in a portion of the participants in all of the studies. Other proxy measures of respiratory distress (e.g., oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood gas analysis) were reported sporadically.</P>
<P>DESIGN:<BR/>All of the studies were randomised-controlled trials with information on withdrawal of participants except in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>), where this information was not stated.</P>

Younger (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>) investigated relapse rate (number of patients) within four weeks and Gleeson (<LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>) counted relapsed patients within three months. Younger (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>) showed that the treatment group were less likely to relapse within this time and although this result is not significant it is extremely close to significance (OR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.03 to 1.01). <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>'s results also show that patients in the treatment group were significantly less likely to relapse within three months of discharge (OR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.76). The combined effect of these two studies shows relapse rate to be significantly lower in the treatment groups (OR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.55). The NNT for this outcome indicates that 3 (95% CI: 2 to 7) children need to be treated with systemic steroids to prevent one relapse at one to three months.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK> reported that the severity of shortness of breath decreased more in the patients who received budesonide than those receiving prednisolone (WMD=-0.77; 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.20).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review examined the best available evidence for the use of systemic or nebulised corticosteroids in the management of acute asthma in children. Several important points arise from this meta-analysis. First, for such an important clinical question, we were surprised at the limited number and small sample sizes of available trials upon which recommendations are based. Second, the data from the included trials were sparse and pooled results were not possible for many important outcomes. Third, the use of systemic corticosteroids seems to favour early discharge in the first 4-6 hours, but does not appear to significantly reduce hospital length of stay. Fourth, improved clinical severity scores were noted in the patients treated with these agents, yet corticosteroid therapy did not improve the measures of pulmonary function or oxygen saturation. Fifth, relapses were less common in the 1-3 months after discharge in the groups treated with systemic corticosteroids. Finally, while adverse effects were rarely reported, these agents seem to be well tolerated.</P>
<P>While the systemic corticosteroids appear to improve some outcomes, there was insufficient research on nebulised agents and firm conclusions regarding their use cannot be offered at this time. The studies included in the review excluded patients requiring intensive care or status asthmaticus, so results cannot be generalised to such patients. None of the studies included patients on regular oral corticosteroids, so the findings may not be generalisable to these patients as well. In chronic asthma, some patients have been reported to require relatively high doses of oral maintenance corticosteroids and others are classified as steroid resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1998</LINK>). Consequently, these results may not apply to these subsets of patients. </P>
<P>CORTICOSTEROID TYPE<BR/>The studies comparing systemic steroids with placebo can be broadly divided into oral and intravenous groups. In the oral corticosteroid comparison, three studies assessed the effect of a single dose of prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connett-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Connett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK>). These patients were obviously well enough to tolerate medication and it was assumed that one dose was adequate for the treatment of their exacerbation. Prednisolone is known to take effect within 1-4 hours and has a physiological half life of 12-30 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Ziment-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziment 1986</LINK>). Therefore it is likely that any benefits of this regimen would be seen initially and then dissipate over the first day. In the intravenous group, all studies used multiple doses for the duration of the stay thus sustaining a continuous steroid effect (<LINK REF="STD-Younger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Younger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gleeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kattan 1980</LINK>). Intravenous medications do not depend on patient compliance or severity. There are greater costs, risks and discomfort of this type of therapy; however, given the between-study comparisons and the small numbers of patients involved, no specific conclusions can be drawn about the comparative efficacy of the two routes of systemic corticosteroid administration. Finally, only one study compared nebulised medication with oral medication in hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1999</LINK>)</P>
<P>SETTING<BR/>These results are applicable to children hospitalised with acute moderate to severe asthma and should be generalisable in developed countries. </P>
<P>SIDE EFFECTS<BR/>None of these studies formally addressed the issue of safety although they all suggested that short courses of steroids were safe when used to treat acute exacerbations of asthma; however, formal safety measurements were generally not part of the evaluations. <LINK REF="STD-Storr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 1987</LINK> reported that most children disliked the taste of the oral medicine. </P>
<P>STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE<BR/>The evidence from this review suggests that treating children with acute severe asthma with systemic steroids may result in earlier discharge and slightly shorter hospital stays when compared with bronchodilator treatment alone. These benefits were not reflected by improved oxygen saturation measurement. Furthermore there was no substantial evidence that pulmonary function tests improve with inpatient steroid therapy. PEFR improved early on in two studies but this was not corroborated by other measures of pulmonary obstruction. There was a trend towards decreasing relapse rates within one to three months in patients who received steroid therapy during their hospitalisation.</P>
<P>Only one study compared nebulised budesonide with oral prednisone showed two small improvements in the nebulised group but the majority of clinical and pulmonary function measures favoured prednisone. This study concluded that the two steroids were equivalent but since the power to detect significant differences was not adequate there is the possibility of a beta error. </P>
<P>METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS</P>
<P>DESIGN OF STUDIES:<BR/>The majority of included studies were constructed to assess whether corticosteroids were of benefit when used in the treatment of exacerbations of asthma requiring hospitalisation. The studies used a variety of outcome measures making it difficult to aggregate data for any outcome other than duration of admission and some measures of pulmonary function. There were no studies comparing the effect of different dosages of steroids on the outcome measures. This has been addressed in another review in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a possibility of publication bias in this meta-analysis. For example, by missing unpublished negative trials we may be over-estimating the effect of corticosteroid treatment. However, a comprehensive search of literature for potentially relevant studies was conducted, using a systematic strategy to avoid bias. This was followed by attempts to contact corresponding and first authors. Although no published trials were identified, some negative trials were found and we recognise that more of these types of trials may exist. <BR/>There is also the possibility of study selection bias. However we employed two independent reviewers, and feel confident that the studies excluded were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons. Our search was comprehensive and so it is unlikely that there were trials in publication which were missed. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children hospitalised with severe acute asthma, emergency department treatment of an asthma exacerbation with systemic corticosteroids will result in an earlier recovery of the illness. The trials suggests that a variety of corticosystemic steroids can be used including oral prednisolone, intravenous methylprednisone and intravenous hydrocortisone. All of these have approximately similar benefits including earlier discharge and improving symptom scores. This review does not support the use of nebulised corticosteroids as a substitute for systemic therapy at this time. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Despite the findings of this review there are many questions arising from the analysis. Given the differing treatments and outcomes it was difficult to make substantial conclusions regarding the effect size of corticosteroid treatment. The multiple types, doses and routes make clear recommendations of one steroid over another impossible. Consequently, the results indicate the following research is required: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A high-quality, multi-center RCT is required examining different routes, doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy.</LI>
<LI>All future studies involving children with asthma require clearly defined and validated outcome measures which are appropriate for age and reported in a standardised fashion. </LI>
<LI>The role of co-interventions such as the frequency and dose of beta agonists must be considered when addressing outcome measures such as lung function.</LI>
<LI>Lack of methodology for assessing potential long term effects of single and repeated courses of systemic steroids is a major limitation to full assessment of this type of intervention; and side-effects must be formally collected in future studies.</LI>
<LI>Further research that includes patients requiring intensive care might be useful to clarify the risk-benefit of different doses and frequency of systemic corticosteroids in this sub group needs to be conducted. </LI>
<LI>Further research on the possible additive beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids needs to be conducted.</LI>
