<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of providing information about a surgeon's performance to people who are thinking of having elective surgery. Elective surgery is defined as "surgery of a non emergency nature; although recommended, it can be scheduled in advance without affecting the health of the patient or the expected result of the procedure" (<A HREF="Dox 2004">Dox 2004</A>, p. 452). </P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Measuring the performance of surgeons is generally thought to be a good practice that will result in better surgical results. Providing information about the performance of individual surgeons is more controversial and it is not clear what effect giving consumers this information might have. We wanted to discover whether there was any evidence about the effect of making data about a surgeon's performance available to people who are thinking about having elective surgery, compared with people making similar decisions without this information.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There have been studies on ways of collecting and reporting information about the performance of surgeons, but we did not find any studies published before March 2014 that looked at the effect of this information on consumers.</P>
<P>This lack of evidence may reflect the practical difficulties and ethical issues involved in researching this topic. For example, surgeons might not be willing to take part in such studies. There might also be legal or ethical problems with providing only some patients with information about a surgeon's performance. However, it would be helpful to have more information to inform debate on this topic. Qualitative studies are needed that explore the attitudes of consumers and professionals towards providing this type of information, and their beliefs about potential effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:03:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>A consumer model of health supports that people undergoing elective surgery should be informed about the past operative performance of their surgeon before making two important decisions: 1. to consent to the proposed surgery, and 2. to have a particular doctor perform the surgery. This information arguably helps empower patients to participate in their care. While surgeons' performance data are available in some settings, there continues to be controversy over the provision of such data to patients, and the question of whether consumers should, or want to, be provided with this information.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-RCTs and controlled before and after studies (CBAs), in which an individual surgeon's performance data were provided to people considering elective surgery. We considered the CBAs for inclusion from 2009 onwards.</P>

<P>We found no studies reporting the impact of the provision of a surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery. This is an important finding in itself. While the public reporting of a surgeon's performance is not a new concept, the efficacy of this data for individual patients has not been empirically tested. A review of qualitative studies or new primary qualitative research may be useful to determine what interventions are currently in use and explore the attitudes of consumers and professionals towards such interventions.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:02:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed the effects of providing a surgeon's performance data to people considering elective surgery.</P>
<P>Reporting information about the performance of health organisations and health professionals is not a new concept. Data have been reported for since the early 1990s and there is some agreement that public reporting of the quality of health care is inevitable (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bolsin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolsin 2012</LINK>). While it is generally supported that performance data will continue to be published, there is still no consensus about how the information is or should be used (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ketelaar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ketelaar 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although governments and organisations are reviewing the public reporting of performance of health organisations and health professionals, their priorities and reporting strategies do not necessarily help individual patients. While the macro public reporting of data and its effects are important to the research field, we must also consider what is important for individual patients who are considering elective surgery in everyday practice. <LINK REF="REF-Keogh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keogh 2004</LINK> suggested that the "measurement of outcomes from medical or surgical interventions is part of good practice, but publication of individual doctors' results remains controversial" (p. 450). In this review, we sought to assess the effects of providing data about a specific surgeon's performance, on an individual considering undertaking an elective surgical procedure. The data provided to the individual in this situation may or may not be part of a data set that is publicly reported. This review is in contrast to another Cochrane review that aims to assess the effects of public release of performance data on consumers, providers and purchasers of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Ketelaar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ketelaar 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">People's requirements for performance data about a surgeon</HEADING>
<P>It is important to consider whether people need or want information about their doctor's performance in order to make decisions about their prospective surgery. In 2001, the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT) in the US found that while consumers were still largely unaware of indicators of care, they would seek information to help choose a doctor and to determine if the correct care was being suggested (<LINK REF="REF-FACCT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FACCT 2001</LINK>). FACCT also reported that participants ranked factual data about a physician as the most useful category of information for choosing a physician (<LINK REF="REF-FACCT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FACCT 2001</LINK>, p. 7). <LINK REF="REF-Ireson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ireson 2002</LINK> stated "consumers want understandable information that is meaningful, timely and trustworthy" (p. 49). <LINK REF="REF-Bozic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozic 2013</LINK> reported "46% of patients were able to find useful information to compare outcomes among surgeons" in a study of people undergoing orthopaedic surgery, but where they found this information was not explored (p. 1867). Opinion continues to vary about whether people want, seek or value information about the surgeon's operative performance when they consider elective surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beresford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beresford 2001</LINK>). This review assumes that patients require information about a surgeon's performance to make informed decisions about their care. Good clinical practice supports that "patients must be given technical information that is clear and unbiased to ensure that their preferences are based on fact and not misconception" (<LINK REF="REF-Say-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2003</LINK>, p. 4).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">A consumer perspective</HEADING>
<P>This review assumed that patients are consumers of health care and should be able to exercise informed choice about their provider, treatment and services (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, this consumer perspective emphasises that, as partners in decision making, patients have rights: they will potentially consider a range of different service providers; the doctor will give information about the proposed treatment; and the person will make decisions based on this information (<LINK REF="REF-Hogg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Goldfield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldfield 2003</LINK> (p. 2) suggested that one use of doctor's profiling is "to provide patients with information to guide their choice of doctor and to assess the quality of services they are receiving". In addition, the law in a number of countries now recognises the personal autonomy of people making healthcare decisions, and requires they be provided with information about any material risks faced in using healthcare services. The greatest requirement of disclosure is usually when the treatment or procedure is elective.</P>
<P>Historically, pre-operative information provided to a patient has focused on describing the surgical procedure and suggesting questions for patients to ask about the procedure. This process is often framed by legal requirements to enable a patient to consent to the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKDH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKDH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CHF-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHF 2013</LINK>). The performance of the attending surgeon is rarely the focus of such pre-operative information. Yet <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK> (p. 12) argues "information about the performance ability of surgeons is a necessary component of the disclosure of the reasonably foreseeable risks of a surgical intervention". Data on a surgeon's performance provide a patient with information about the risks of having a procedure performed by a particular surgeon (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marasco-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marasco 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>While this review advocates a consumer perspective, it also recognises that a patient's choice of surgeon may be limited by several factors. These include the ability to pay for services, the willingness of the health practitioner to provide the service, mixed public/private healthcare systems, the urgency of treatment and the complexities of the doctor-patient relationship. Diversity across consumer groups also makes it difficult to describe the views and choices of 'ordinary' consumers or patients across different countries. Despite these difficulties, a consumer perspective advocates patient choice, with the ability to question and make fully informed decisions about treatment options. This perspective supports a patient's right to explore questions about their treating surgeon's performance.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Performance data</HEADING>
<P>Issues affecting the reporting of an individual surgeon's operative performance are complex, and include: professional culture, organisational policies and procedures, understanding how much information the patient actually requires, access to resources, available data, patient co-morbidities, risk analysis and scientific presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Poloniecki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poloniecki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilfillan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilfillan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldfield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldfield 2003</LINK>). While league tables and report cards on performance can theoretically reveal to the public the extent to which health insurance plans, healthcare providers and institutions are meeting goals, the challenge is to develop measures that are applicable and useful for consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Christianson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christianson 2010</LINK>). Importantly, the key stakeholders, including surgeons and consumers, need transparency on the reasons for publishing the data and assurances that such data are valid, accurate and appropriately reported (<LINK REF="REF-Exworthy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Exworthy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahlke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlke 2014</LINK>). The data's usefulness depends on many factors including the ability to cater for case mix, and whether the publication is designed to facilitate patient choice or show consistency of standards (<LINK REF="REF-Keogh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keogh 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is limited guidance on what information should be given to patients about a surgeon's past operative performance. <LINK REF="REF-Cuschieri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuschieri 2000</LINK> suggested that essential data about the surgeon's past performance when operating on similar cases are: surgical outcomes (technical aspects of procedure), morbidity data (as related to the specific diagnosis) and mortality data (as related to the specific procedure). The scope of this review is constrained by reliance on the data presented in different studies. Quality issues associated with the performance data provided to patients are outside the scope of this review. However, data that informs patients about a surgeon's past performance operating on similar cases&#8212;surgical outcomes, morbidity and mortality&#8212;are considered essential.</P>
<P>In the context of a consumer model of health care, patients should be informed about the surgeon's past operative performance before making two important decisions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>to consent to the proposed surgery, and </LI>
<LI>to have a particular doctor perform the surgery.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The intervention we considered in this review is the provision of information about the surgeon's past operative performance. The primary outcomes of this intervention concern the decision to consent for the proposed surgery and to have a particular doctor perform that surgery. As these decisions may be compromised by the relative urgency of the surgery during a non-elective or emergency scenario, this review only considers people requiring elective surgery.</P>
<P>We acknowledged before commencing the review that few relevant trials were likely to exist. Patients' information requirements in everyday practice are still being debated and it is not surprising that the provision of information about the performance of individual surgeons is controversial. Such controversy only increases the importance of reliably determining the effects of such information provision for people considering elective surgery.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:12:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We intended to assess and report on the methodological risk of bias of included studies in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and the guidelines of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2013</LINK>), which recommend the explicit reporting of the following individual elements for RCTs: random sequence generation; allocation sequence concealment; blinding (participants, personnel); blinding (outcome assessment); completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. We intended to consider blinding separately for different outcomes where appropriate (e.g. blinding may have the potential to affect subjective versus objective outcome measures differently). We intended to judge each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria provided by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, and provide a quote from the study report and a justification for our judgement for each item in the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>We intended to deem studies at the highest risk of bias if they were scored at high or unclear risk of bias for either the sequence generation or allocation concealment domains, based on growing empirical evidence that these factors are particularly important potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all cases, two review authors intended to assess independently the risk of bias of included studies, and resolve any disagreements by discussion to reach consensus. We intended to contact study authors for additional information about the included studies or for clarification of the study methods as required. We intended to incorporate the results of the risk of bias assessment into the review through standard tables, and systematic narrative description and commentary about each of the elements, leading to an overall assessment the risk of bias of included studies and a judgement about the internal validity of the review's results.</P>
<P>We planned to assess included quasi-RCTs using the 'Risk of bias' tool, rating them at a high risk of bias on the random sequence generation item of the tool.</P>
<P>If we had included cluster RCTs in the review, we would have assessed and reported the risk of bias associated with the additional domain of selective recruitment of cluster participants (as described in <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We would have assessed included CBA studies against the same criteria as RCTs but reported them at high risk of bias on both the random sequence generation and allocation sequence concealment items. We would have excluded CBA studies where the groups were not reasonably comparable at baseline.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:12:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we intended to analyse data based on the number of events and the number of people assessed in the intervention and comparison groups. We intended to use these to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous measures, we intended to analyse data based on the mean, standard deviation (SD) and number of people assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If the MD was reported without individual group data, we intended to use this to report the study results. If more than one study had measured the same outcome using different tools, we intended to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI using the inverse-variance method in Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>For CBA studies, we intended to report appropriate effect measures for dichotomous outcomes (RR, adjusted RR) and continuous outcomes (relative per cent change post intervention, SMD). </P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:12:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>For cluster-RCTs, we intended to check for unit-of-analysis errors. If we had found errors, and sufficient information was available, we intended to re-analyse the data using the appropriate unit of analysis, by taking account of the intracluster correlation (ICC). We intended to obtain estimates of the ICC by contacting authors of included studies, or impute ICC using estimates from external sources. If it were not possible to obtain sufficient information to re-analyse the data, we intended to report effect estimates and annotate unit-of-analysis error.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:12:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Had we found applicable studies with missing data, we intended to attempt to contact study authors to request missing data. For participant data, we intended to, where possible, conduct analysis on an intention-to-treat basis; otherwise, we planned to report data as reported. We intended to report the levels of loss to follow-up and assess this as a source of potential bias.</P>
<P>Had we identified applicable missing outcome or summary data, we intended to impute missing data where possible and report any assumptions in the review. We intended to investigate, through sensitivity analyses, the effects of any imputed data on pooled effect estimates.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:13:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Had we found studies that we considered similar enough to allow pooling of data using meta-analysis, we intended to assess the degree of heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and by examining the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity. We intended to quantify heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We planned to consider an I<SUP>2 </SUP>value of 50% or more to represent substantial levels of heterogeneity, but we intended to interpret this value depending on the size and direction of effects and the strength of the evidence for heterogeneity, based on the P value from the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Had we detected substantial clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity across included studies, we planned not to report pooled results from meta-analysis but planned to use a narrative approach to data synthesis. In this event, we intended to explore possible clinical or methodological reasons for this variation by grouping similar studies to explore differences in intervention effects.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:13:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We intended to assess reporting bias qualitatively based on the characteristics of the included studies (e.g. if we identified only small studies that indicated positive findings).</P>
<P>If we had identified sufficient studies (at least 10) for inclusion in the review, we intended to construct a funnel plot to investigate small-study effects, which may indicate the presence of publication bias. We intended to test formally for funnel plot asymmetry, with the choice of test made based on advice in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, and planned to discuss the various reasons for funnel plot asymmetry when interpreting the results.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:13:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The primary analysis intended to compare outcome data for participants for whom the routine pre-operative consultation included a planned and formal presentation of information about the surgeon's performance record, with data for participants for whom this did not occur.</P>
<P>Once we had extracted the data, we intended to complete a narrative presentation of all studies structured according to the intervention. If enough studies existed, we planned to undertake further stratification by:<BR/>
</P>

</UL>
<P>We considered it unlikely that a meta-analysis would be possible due to an expected lack of studies. If we had found studies, we anticipated that there would be heterogeneity in the interventions, data used and outcomes. If studies were sufficiently similar in design, interventions and outcomes, we intended to undertake a meta-analysis using a random-effects model.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-01-19 14:18:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the search strategies returned a rich and varied literature, we identified no studies that met this review's inclusion criteria. Patients should have appropriate information to enable them to participate in decisions about their surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jha 2006</LINK>). Information about an individual surgeon's performance is relevant to patients in this context. Some of the challenges underpinning the provision of such information include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>public reporting of performance data for organisations, units and surgeons;</LI>
<LI>issues with the published data's accuracy, relevance and usability;</LI>
<LI>ethical issues associated with publishing comparative data for surgeons; and</LI>
<LI>the potential use of a surgeon's data in the consent process.</LI>
</UL>
<P>While this search revealed no studies that met this review's inclusion criteria, there may be more in the broader qualitative literature that could inform the design of an intervention and its evaluation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Public reporting of performance data for organisations, units and surgeons</HEADING>
<P>Public reporting of data remains controversial. Report cards are used to provide performance outcome data at different levels of health services provision such as hospital, unit or individual doctor. The literature suggests that report cards documenting hospital- and unit-level outcome performance can be used in a proactive way to monitor quality and help drive improvements; however, we found no studies examining the effects of directly providing a surgeon's performance data to an individual patient. Rather, the background literature confirms challenges that continue to impact the public disclosure of individual surgeon's performance data (<LINK REF="REF-Ghalandarpoorattar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghalandarpoorattar 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marjoua-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoua 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Proponents of report cards argue that they provide consumers with information that allows them to have greater choice about their surgeon or health provider (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keogh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keogh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mukamel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mukamel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marasco-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marasco 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2007</LINK>). However, there is no evidence of consumer uptake in line with this argument. For example, one excluded study that reviewed public reporting of risk-adjusted coronary bypass graft mortality rates in New York concluded that "...despite a decade of experience, we found no evidence that purchasers or patients are using these reports to drive market share to higher-performing providers" (<LINK REF="STD-Jha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jha 2006</LINK>, p. 854). This is consistent with previous reports, such as <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1998</LINK>, which found that "public reporting of mortality outcomes in Pennsylvania has had virtually no direct impact on patients' selection of hospitals or surgeons" (p. 1642).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Issues with the published data's accuracy, relevance and usability</HEADING>
<P>Questions of relevance, accessibility and usefulness confront the reporting of performance data. Are the statistics accurate? Are patients able to interpret league tables of risk-adjusted mortality figures? Can patients make sense of the information they are given? Is the information current (since data "typically becomes available one to three years after the observation period"; <LINK REF="STD-Jha-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jha 2006</LINK>, p. 845)? Are patients likely to misinterpret the data? How can the confidentiality of data presented to patients be maintained? These questions all raise valid issues for further research and are factors that may have deterred specific research in the area. <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2007</LINK> suggested that current reporting is intended for a number of different audiences, and people considering elective surgery are only one of many stakeholder groups. Hence, the information provided may not be suitable for their particular needs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ranganathan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ranganathan 2009</LINK> showed that patients appear to make limited use of the available physician's performance data. This excluded study invited 6611 active and retired General Electric employees to view a physician's quality ratings website. Only 376 participants registered, yielding a registration rate of 5.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Ranganathan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ranganathan 2009</LINK>, p. 75). Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2007</LINK> suggested that any assumption that patients are able to choose their surgeon based on the performance data provided may not adequately consider the patient-doctor relationship or reflect the true level of patient empowerment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ethical issues associated with publishing comparative data for surgeons</HEADING>
<P>A key ethical concern associated with publishing comparative performance data is that surgeons may be encouraged to avoid high-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-Burack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marasco-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marasco 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guru-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guru 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maytham-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maytham 2011</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Hannan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannan 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Keogh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keogh 2004</LINK> also suggested that "publication of individuals' results remains controversial because of the potential, unintended negative effects and increasing recognition that individuals' results are strongly influenced by institutional influences that may impinge differently on different individuals" (p. 453). Keogh's comments, made in 2004, continue to be supported in the current literature (<LINK REF="REF-Guru-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guru 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marjoua-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoua 2012</LINK>). While the unresolved debate on the provision of individual surgeon's data, especially comparative data, continues, it potentially discourages research in the review area.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The potential use of a surgeon's data in the consent process</HEADING>
<P>One of the compelling arguments for the provision of an individual surgeon's performance data to a person considering elective surgery revolves around its relevance to informed consent. <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK> (see also <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2007</LINK>) strongly advocates access to an individual surgeon's performance data by people considering surgery as a provision for informed consent. However, there is little agreement in this area and <LINK REF="REF-Freckelton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freckelton 2007</LINK> observed that "report cards for doctors and for health institutions at this stage have no formal legal status, although, like a variety of other documents, they have the potential to be utilised in an evidentiary sense as a yardstick [i.e. standard comparison] for delineating acceptable and actionable conduct" (p. 279). One review of interventions to promote informed consent for people undergoing a surgical procedure did not highlight any interventions for the provision of a surgeon's performance data (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnersley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnersley 2013</LINK>). Any requirement to provide an individual surgeon's performance data to a person considering elective surgery as part of the informed consent process remains controversial.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:15:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The absence of any included studies limited this review and the discussion was informed by the review of general background literature identified by the search strategies.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:15:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This review did not identify any randomised or quasi-randomised trials or controlled before and after studies providing individual surgeons' performance data to people considering elective surgery. The core issues pertaining to this review have not yet been the subject of any descriptive or analytical studies. No implications for practice can be stated, as there are no data to support how the provision of surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery may influence their involvement in their care and decision making about the choice of surgeon.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-14 20:15:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Surgeons' performance data have been reported in a variety of ways since the mid-1990s; however, we identified no studies assessing the effects of such reporting for people considering elective surgery. The absence of relevant studies may suggest that such research is difficult to undertake. This indicates that the first question to be addressed is "What type of studies should be completed to explore the outcomes associated with an intervention that provides people considering elective surgery with the surgeon's performance data?" While randomised studies are normally the preferred research method, there are several barriers that might render the application of such a rigorous approach unrealistic. Potential problems arising from any proposed trial or study could be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>would surgeons be prepared to participate in a study?</LI>
<LI>how would randomisation of participants be completed?</LI>
<LI>are there ethical issues regarding the provision of the surgeon's performance data to intervention patients and not to control patients?</LI>
<LI>are there any legal ramifications for the consent process for such as a study(i.e. not providing all the available information for a patient to make an informed choice)?</LI>
<LI>how would the intervention information (data) be maintained in a confidential manner?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Initial qualitative studies could further the discourse, determine what interventions are currently in use and explore the attitudes of consumers and professionals towards such interventions along with their beliefs about potential effects.</P>

<P>Following advice from the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group, we adjusted the search strategy that presented in the protocol to broaden the range of captured citations (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2007</LINK>). The full search strategies that we used are presented in the Appendices of the 2010 review.</P>
<P>Following advice from the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group, we amended the databases we had planned to search, as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CancerLit - not included;</LI>
<LI>we searched Current Contents instead of the Science Citation Index expanded;</LI>
<LI>HMIC: The Health Management Information Consortium - not included.</LI>
<LI>International Meta Register of Controlled Trials - not included;</LI>
<LI>Evidenced based Internet healthcare resources - not included;</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE - added.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We updated the methods in the current iteration of the review to reflect changes to the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and Cochrane Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards.
