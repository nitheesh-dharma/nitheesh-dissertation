<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures, and is not always well controlled. Combining analgesics from different classes has the potential to provide adequate pain relief with reduced dose-dependent adverse events. This review assessed data from twenty-six studies comparing paracetamol plus codeine with placebo, and fourteen studies comparing paracetamol plus codeine with the same dose of paracetamol alone. The combination provided effective pain relief for about 40% of participants experiencing moderate to severe pain after an operation with 600 to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, the dose most commonly used in these studies, and about 50% of participants with 800 to 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, the dose most commonly used in clinical practice. The addition of codeine provided effective pain relief to about 10% more participants than the same dose of paracetamol alone. These single dose studies did not associate paracetamol plus codeine with any serious side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-11 15:33:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 1998. Combining drugs from different classes with different modes of action may offer opportunity to optimise efficacy and tolerability, using lower doses of each drug to achieve the same degree of pain relief. Previously we concluded that addition of codeine to paracetamol provided additional pain relief, but at expense of additional adverse events. New studies have been published since. This review sought to evaluate efficacy and safety of paracetamol plus codeine using current data, and compare findings with other analgesics evaluated similarly.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-03 08:15:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of paracetamol plus codeine, compared with placebo or the same dose of paracetamol alone, for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 15:35:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the &#8220;pain relief versus time&#8221; curve was used to derive proportion of participants with paracetamol plus codeine and placebo or paracetamol alone experiencing least 50% pain relief over four-to-six hours, using validated equations. Number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 15:44:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Twenty-six studies, with 2295 participants, were included comparing paracetamol plus codeine with placebo. Significant dose response was seen for the outcome of at least 50% pain relief over four-to-six hours, with NNTs of 2.2 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.9) for 800 to 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, 3.9 (2.9 to 4.5) for 600 to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, and 6.9 (4.8 to 12) for 300 mg paracetamol plus 30 mg codeine. Time to use of rescue medication was over four hours with paracetamol plus codeine and two hours with placebo. The NNT to prevent remedication was 5.6 (4.0 to 9.0) for 600 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine over four to six hours. Adverse events increased of mainly mild to moderate severity with paracetamol plus codeine than placebo.</P>
<P>Fourteen studies, with 926 participants, were included in the comparison of paracetamol plus codeine with the same dose of paracetamol alone. Addition of codeine increased proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four-to-six hours by 10 to 15%, increased time to use of rescue medication by about one hour, and reduced proportion of participants needing rescue medication by about 15% (NNT to prevent remedication 6.9 (4.2 to 19). Adverse events were mainly mild to moderate in severity and incidence did not differ between groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:22:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This update confirms previous findings that combining paracetamol with codeine provided clinically useful levels of pain relief in about 50% of patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, compared with under 20% with placebo. New information for remedication shows that the combination extended the duration of analgesia by about one hour compared to treatment with the same dose of paracetamol alone. At higher doses, more participants experienced adequate pain relief, but the amount of information available for the 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine dose was small, and based on limited information.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:27:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This is an update of a review published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>in Issue 4, 1998 on 'Single dose paracetamol (acetaminophen), with and without codeine, for postoperative pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998a</LINK>). The title now states that the review is limited to adults. The previous review looked at three sets of comparisons: paracetamol versus placebo, paracetamol with codeine versus placebo, and paracetamol with codeine versus paracetamol. This review updates only the paracetamol with codeine versus placebo or paracetamol alone comparisons. A separate review looks at paracetamol versus placebo only (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage commonly accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care. This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level.</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants is small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome in this setting. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients often remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then go home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paracetamol</HEADING>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was first identified as the active metabolite of two older antipyretic drugs, acetanilide and phenacetin in the late nineteenth century but the drug was not added to the British Pharmacopoeia until 1963 (<LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>). Since then it has become one of the most popular antipyretic and analgesic drugs worldwide, and is also often used in combination with other drugs.</P>
<P>The lack of significant anti-inflammatory activity for paracetamol implies a mode of action distinct from that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) yet, despite years of use and research, the mechanisms of action of paracetamol are not fully understood. NSAIDs act by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX). COX (now recognised to consist of two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2) catalyses the production of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. Paracetamol has previously been shown to have no significant effects on COX-1 or COX-2 (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 2003</LINK>), but is now being considered as a selective COX-2 inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Hinz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinz 2008</LINK>). Significant paracetamol-induced inhibition of prostaglandin production has been demonstrated in tissues in the brain, spleen, and lung (<LINK REF="REF-Flower-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flower 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Botting-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botting 2000</LINK>). A 'COX-3 hypothesis' wherein the efficacy of paracetamol is attributed to its specific inhibition of a third cyclooxygenase isoform enzyme, COX-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Botting-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botting 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chandrasekharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandrasekharan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>) now has little credibility, and a central mode action of paracetamol is thought to be likely (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite a low incidence of adverse effects, paracetamol has a recognised potential for hepatotoxicity and is thought to be responsible for approximately half of all cases of liver failure in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2001</LINK>). Acute paracetamol hepatotoxicity at therapeutic doses is extremely unlikely despite reports of so-called therapeutic misadventure (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2000</LINK>). In recent years legislative changes restricting pack sizes and the maximum number of tablets permitted in over-the-counter sales were introduced in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1997</LINK>) on the basis of evidence that poisoning is lower in countries that restrict availability (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 1997</LINK>). The contribution of these changes to any observed reductions in incidence of liver failure or death, which are inconvenient and more costly (particularly to chronic pain sufferers), remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2007</LINK>). There have been concerns over the safety of paracetamol in patients with compromised hepatic function (those with severe alcoholism, cirrhosis or hepatitis) but these have not been substantiated (<LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dart 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paracetamol is the analgesic of choice for adult patients in whom salicylates or other NSAIDs are contraindicated. Such patients include asthmatics, those with salicylate allergies, and those with a history of peptic ulcer. Compared with available alternatives, it is associated with few problems in all but the most compromised of renal patients, and few drug-drug interactions. Paracetamol is useful for children with febrile viral illnesses, in whom aspirin is contraindicated due to the risk of Reye's syndrome (swelling of the brain that may lead to coma and death).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paracetamol with codeine</HEADING>
<P>Paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids have different mechanisms of action and side effect profiles, and combining drugs from these main classes may offer the opportunity to optimise efficacy and tolerability. It is thought that reduced doses of two (or more) drugs from different classes, given together, can provide adequate pain relief, acting via different targets, while reducing dose dependent adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>). The combination of paracetamol and an opioid is an attractive choice, particularly for individuals for whom NSAIDs are contraindicated. In contrast to most other classes of analgesic, opioids do not cause direct organ damage in long-term use, but they have limited tolerability due to their common, troublesome side effects (constipation, somnolence, dry mouth, nausea and dizziness), and must be used with care in the elderly, or individuals with renal impairment.</P>
<P>Paracetamol with codeine is an established, cheap and widely available combination. The earlier Cochrane review concluded that the combination is effective for postoperative pain, but additional trials have since been published. This review aims to provide more robust estimates of both efficacy and harm, in a format which facilitates direct comparison with other analgesics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>QUOROM guidelines were followed (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one valid post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. Analyses were planned for different doses (where there were at least 200 participants). Sensitivity analyses were planned for pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain), trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm), and quality score (two versus three or more).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: Number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief</HEADING>
<P>For each study, mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) for active and placebo groups were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active treatment and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit (RR) and number-needed-to-treat to benefit (NNT).<BR/>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, numbers of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" were taken as those achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes:</HEADING>
<P>1. <B>Use of rescue medication</B>. Numbers of participants requiring rescue medication were used to calculate numbers-needed-to-treat to prevent (NNTp) use of rescue medication for treatment and placebo groups. Median (or mean) time to use of rescue medication was used to calculate the weighted mean of the median (or mean) for the outcome. Where fewer than 50% of participants required rescue medication at the time of censorship, the median time was taken as the time of censorship. This will give a conservative estimate for time to use of rescue medication. Weighting was by number of participants.</P>
<P>
<I>2. </I>
<B>Adverse events</B>
<I>. </I>Numbers of participants reporting adverse events for each treatment group were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and numbers needed to treat to harm (NNH) estimates for:<BR/>

<P>Relative benefit and risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). NNT or NNH with 95% CI were calculated using the pooled number of events by the method of Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). A statistically significant difference from control was assumed when the 95% CI of the relative benefit did not include the number one.</P>
<P>Homogeneity of studies was assessed visually (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abb_x00e9_-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbé 1987</LINK>). The z test (<LINK REF="REF-Tram_x00e8_r-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tramèr 1997</LINK>) was used to determine if there was a significant difference between NNTs for different doses of active treatment, or between groups in the sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>Participants who took rescue medication were classified as withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and are reported under 'use of rescue medication' above.</P>
<P>Data on other withdrawals were generally poorly reported, probably because these were single dose studies where withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy are uncommon. Some studies reported participants who had invalid data due to inadequate baseline pain, who violated a protocol, or took rescue medication within the first hour, as withdrawals or exclusions. Whether these should be included in the intention to treat population is arguable. Attrition due to invalid data is unlikely to affect results.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 15:07:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Since the previous review of paracetamol with codeine in acute pain a number of new studies of good methodological quality have been published. For the comparison with placebo, new studies added 459 participants treated with 600 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, and 109 treated with 300 mg paracetamol plus 30 mg codeine. This more than doubles the number of participants for the 600 plus 60 mg dose analysis, and adds 75% more to the 300 plus 30 mg analysis. No new trials compared 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine with placebo. For the comparison with paracetamol alone, only 74 new participants treated with 800 or 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine were added, but even this almost doubled the number available for analysis at this dose (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. This is now generally regarded as a useful level of pain relief in acute pain, and also in chronic pain conditions such as arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>) and neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>). It has the advantage that it also highlights that not all of those given an analgesic have useful pain relief, and that interventions do not work in everyone. Participants not having a useful level of pain relief are important because therapeutic failure is to be avoided. Figures and tables therefore provide percentages of patients with outcomes, as well as statistical comparisons.</P>
<P>The variation in placebo and active response rates was large, but this degree of variation is common in pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1996</LINK>), and occurs because of the random play of chance (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998b</LINK>). Paracetamol plus codeine was significantly better than placebo, with a clear dose response for the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. At doses of 300 mg paracetamol plus 30 mg codeine about 30% of participants achieved this level of pain relief, rising to about 40% with 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, and 50% with 800 to 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine. Corresponding NNTs were 6.9 (4.8 to 12), 3.9 (3.3 to 4.7) and 2.2 (1.8 to 2.9). These results are consistent with those found in the earlier review, but should be more robust because of the increased number of participants. Seven people would need to be treated with 600 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, and two with 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, for one more to experience at least 50% pain relief, who would not have done so with placebo.</P>
<P>Because the same methods of analyses have been used, it is possible to compare the NNT for a single dose of oral paracetamol plus codeine with that of a single dose of other analgesics.</P>

</UL>
<P>A current listing of reviews of analgesics in the single dose postoperative pain model can be found at <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier</A>.</P>
<P>The comparison of combination therapy with the same dose of paracetamol alone demonstrated that the addition of codeine increased the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief by over 10%. No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between 800 mg to 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine and 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, although the higher dose did give a lower (better) NNT of 6.1 (3.6 to 19) compared to 8.2 (5.0 to 23). Six people would need to be treated with 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine for one more to experience at least 50% pain relief, who would not have done so with the same dose of paracetamol alone. One of the four studies contributing to the higher dose analysis compared 800 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine with 1000 mg paracetamol alone, rather than 800 mg (exactly the same dose). Omitting this study from the analysis gave a lower (better) NNT of 5.1 (3.1 to 15), but did not significantly change the result. The higher dose of paracetamol in the comparator arm would be expected, if anything, to reduce the estimate of efficacy for the combination therapy arm.</P>
<P>We have effective analgesics, but clinical practice finds it difficult to use effective analgesics effectively. More immediately relevant outcomes are needed than relative benefit and even NNTs. One such outcome is the time before participants with adequate pain relief require additional analgesic because the pain has returned. This can be measured in terms of the mean or median time to remedication, or the percentage of participants needing more analgesic over a particular time. This update includes both these outcomes. The previous review did not report data on participants using rescue medication, and not all studies (17/28) provided this information, which restricted analysis, particularly by dose.</P>
<P>The median time to use of rescue medication varied greatly between trials, particularly for the active treatment arms, but was generally longer for paracetamol plus codeine than for placebo or paracetamol alone. The weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication (all doses of paracetamol plus codeine) at 4.3 hours is equal to or shorter than most non-selective NSAIDs (diclofenac 50 mg 3.8 hours, ibuprofen 400 mg 5.3 hours, naproxen 9.8 hours) and much shorter than etoricoxib 120 mg and rofecoxib 50 mg (20 hours or more). The addition of codeine to paracetamol extended the duration of action by about one hour. There were insufficient data to analyse this by dose, as not all studies reporting number of patients remedicating also reported this outcome. Most of the data was for the 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine dose, for which about 60% of participants receiving the combination therapy used rescue medication over four to six hours, compared to about 80% of those receiving placebo. Five participants would need to be treated with this dose of the combination to prevent one using rescue medication over four to six hours, who would have done so if treated with placebo. The addition of 60 mg codeine to 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol decreased the number of participants using rescue medication by about 15%; seven people would need to be treated with 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine for one fewer to need rescue medication over four to six hours, who would have done so if treated with the same dose of paracetamol alone.</P>
<P>Longer duration of action is desirable in an analgesic, particularly in a postoperative setting where the patient may experience postoperative nausea, or be dependent on a third party to respond to a request for rescue medication. Duration of pain relief and requirement of rescue medication information have only recently been recognised as important outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), and a fuller evaluation of the importance of these outcomes will depend on more data being collected from other, ongoing, systematic reviews.</P>
<P>Assessment of adverse events is limited in single dose studies as the size and duration of the trials permits only the simplest analysis, as has been emphasised previously (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). Combining results was potentially hampered by the different periods over which the data was collected. There was also an uncertainty about whether adverse event data continued to be collected after rescue medication had been taken. This could disproportionately inflate adverse events in the placebo groups, which tended to use more rescue medication. Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity, and were most likely to be related to the anaesthetic or surgical procedure (e.g. nausea, vomiting and somnolence). Although the original review compared individual adverse events, we deemed there to be insufficient data in for this analysis to be valid.</P>
<P>There was a significant difference between paracetamol plus codeine and placebo for numbers of participants experiencing any adverse event in the hours immediately following a single dose of the study medication for all doses together and for 600 mg to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine. Analyses for higher and lower doses did not show a significant difference, but numbers of participants in these groups were small. There was no significant difference between paracetamol plus codeine and the same dose of paracetamol alone.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events were reported. It is important to recognise that adverse event analysis after single dose oral administration will not reflect possible adverse events occurring with use of drugs for longer periods of time. In addition, the relatively small numbers of participants, even when all the trials were combined, and short duration of studies is insufficient to detect rare but serious adverse events, which typically occur with longer use, and usually less frequently than one in 1000.</P>
<P>All studies were of adequate or good methodological quality. The sensitivity analyses did not demonstrate an effect of dental model on NNT for 50% pain relief in the comparison of paracetamol plus codeine and placebo, where there were sufficient data to analyse by dose. For the comparison of combination therapy with placebo, studies with fewer than 40 participants in each treatment arm had a higher active response rate and lower (better) NNT than those with more than 40 per treatment arm, but this comparison was confounded by dose, with the smaller treatment arms using 600 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine (nine studies) or 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine (one study), and the larger treatment arms using 300 mg paracetamol plus 30 mg codeine (four studies) or 600 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine (one study). The comparison of combination therapy with paracetamol alone was also confounded by dose, but did not demonstrate a difference between smaller and larger studies.</P>
<P>The main limitation is that these were single-dose studies, and they could be criticised because pain relief, even in the acute setting, usually requires multiple dosing. That is true, but, in very general terms, pain is pain, and these single dose studies have been used for over 60 years to establish <B>that a drug is actually an analgesic</B>. The relative effectiveness of drugs and other interventions in this setting translates well to other settings like migraine, or musculoskeletal pain. It is unfortunate that so little data were available for the 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine dose. This is the most commonly used dose in clinical practice in some parts of the world, including the UK, but is under-represented in these studies. The information that is available indicates that this dose is superior to the lower doses.</P>

<P>The data found in this update for Issue 1, 2009 further supports previous findings although more research is still required. The combination of paracetamol and codeine is an effective analgesic in postoperative pain with a low incidence of adverse events. At a dose of 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine it provides effective analgesia for over half of patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain following various types of surgery. The addition of codeine increases the proportion of patients with effective pain relief by over 10%, but increases the number of patients experiencing adverse events. Associated adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, and did not lead to withdrawal.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-04 09:06:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional data for the higher dose is needed to confirm the dose response demonstrated in this review, and provide a more robust estimate of efficacy. More consistent data on use of rescue medication would provide better estimates of duration of analgesia, which in turn may help to decide which analgesics are most effective in the clinical setting. While more recent studies were generally of good quality, and efficacy data, where collected, was well reported, the quality of adverse event reporting remains problematical.</P>

<P>2011: This review is an update of a previous review of single dose paracetamol and codeine in postoperative pain. Originally paracetamol plus codeine was part of a larger review that included paracetamol alone, published in 1998. The original review was split into two components and both have been updated in 2008.</P>
<P>2016: A restricted search in June 2016 only identified one relevant study (Gatoulis 2012). However, we judged that this study was unlikely to change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised for five years following discussion with the authors and editors. If appropriate, we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale: </HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none=0, mild=1, moderate=2 and severe=3, and for relief none=0, slight=1, moderate=2, good or lots=3 and complete=4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">VAS: </HEADING>
<P>Visual analogue scale: lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR: </HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. The trapezoidal rule is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID: </HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
