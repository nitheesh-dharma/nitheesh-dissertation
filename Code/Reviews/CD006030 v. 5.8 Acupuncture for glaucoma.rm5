<P>Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve and affects primarily the side vision. It is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Although many treatments are available, including eye drops, laser treatment, and surgical procedures, some patients may seek complementary or alternative medicine approaches such as acupuncture to supplement their regular treatment. This review aimed to evaluate available evidence in the findings of randomized controlled trials to assess whether acupuncture is useful and safe in treating patients with glaucoma. We included in the review one completed and one ongoing trial, and we recorded seven trials (all published in Chinese) awaiting assessment for eligibility. The completed trial was conducted in Taiwan among 33 patients. This trial compared auricular acupressure&#65293;a nonstandard acupuncture technique&#65293;versus a sham procedure (which is a fake procedure designed to resemble the real one) for glaucoma. The trial measured intraocular pressure and visual acuity during an eight-week follow-up period. The quality of this trial was not high. According to the findings of this trial, auricular acupressure lowers intraocular pressure by around 4 mm Hg for the right eye and around 5 mm Hg for the left eye at four weeks, but not significantly effective at any other time points or for any other visual outcomes. The safety of acupuncture was not examined in this trial. To date, the ongoing trial "Acupuncture for Glaucoma" has not recruited any participants. On the basis of currently available evidence, the benefit and harm of acupuncture as a therapeutic modality for glaucoma cannot be established. Inclusion of the seven Chinese trials that are awaiting assessment for eligibility in the future may change our conclusions.</P>

<P>Glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by an acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells at levels beyond normal age-related loss and corresponding atrophy of the optic nerve. Although many treatments are available to manage glaucoma, glaucoma is a chronic condition. Some patients may seek complementary or alternative medicine approaches such as acupuncture to supplement their regular treatment. The underlying plausibility of acupuncture is that disorders related to the flow of Chi (the traditional Chinese concept translated as vital force or energy) can be prevented or treated by stimulating relevant points on the body surface.</P>

<P>We included one completed and one ongoing trial, and recorded seven trials awaiting assessment for eligibility. These seven trials were written in Chinese and were identified from a systematic review on the same topic published in a Chinese journal. The completed trial compared auricular acupressure&#65293;a nonstandard acupuncture technique&#65293;with the sham procedure for glaucoma. This trial is rated at high risk of bias for masking of outcome assessors, unclear risk of bias for selective outcome reporting, and low risk of bias for other domains. The difference in intraocular pressure (measured in mm Hg) in the acupressure group was significantly less than that in the sham group at four weeks (-3.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.11 to -0.29 for the right eye; -4.90, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.72 for the left eye), but was not statistically different at any other follow-up time points, including the longest follow-up time at eight weeks. No statistically significant difference in visual acuity was noted at any follow-up time points.

<P>At this time, it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from available data to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of glaucoma. Because of ethical considerations, RCTs comparing acupuncture alone with standard glaucoma treatment or placebo are unlikely to be justified in countries where the standard of care has already been established. Because most glaucoma patients currently cared for by ophthalmologists do not use nontraditional therapy, clinical practice decisions will have to be based on physician judgments and patient preferences, given this lack of data in the literature. Inclusion of the seven Chinese trials in future updates of this review may change our conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-18 16:10:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by an acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells at levels beyond normal age-related baseline loss and corresponding atrophy of the optic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>). Glaucoma affects primarily peripheral vision and is asymptomatic in its earlier stages. It is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glaucoma is classified on the basis of anatomic features as open-angle (where the anterior chamber angle of the eye remains open) and angle-closure (with closure of the anterior chamber angle). Glaucoma is considered primary if the eye has no preexisting disease. Secondary forms of glaucoma are caused by various ocular or systemic diseases such as pigment dispersion syndrome and ocular trauma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>More than two million people in the United States are living with glaucoma; 80,000 of these individuals are legally blind as a result of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1985</LINK>). It was estimated that 60.5 million people were affected by glaucoma in 2010, and bilateral blindness were present in 4.5 million people with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and in 3.9 million people with angle-closure glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2006</LINK>). The prevalence of glaucoma is higher in the elderly, in persons of African descent, and in people with diabetes, hypertension, or myopia (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-18 08:13:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>). POAG usually has an insidious onset and progresses slowly and painlessly, affecting one or both eyes. Because central vision is relatively unaffected until late in the disease, visual loss generally progresses without symptoms. Diagnosis of POAG is based on evidence of optic nerve damage presented as a structural abnormality of the optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer, or as the presence of characteristic abnormalities in the visual field. Additional criteria include a normal appearing open anterior chamber angle and absence of secondary causes of glaucoma. Although most glaucoma patients exhibit increased intraocular pressure (IOP) upon repeated measurement, some may have IOP that is within the average range (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients may present with acute elevation of IOP, when the entire circumference of the anterior chamber angle is obstructed suddenly. Intermittent closure of the anterior chamber angle may lead to chronic angle-closure glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis of angle-closure can be achieved by gonioscopy, which is an examination of the structure and width of the anterior chamber angle. Angle-closure glaucoma is reserved for eyes in which glaucomatous optic neuropathy or visual field defect is evident in the presence of angle-closure.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-18 11:19:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Current treatments for glaucoma are directed at lowering IOP because IOP is the only known risk factor that can be treated with the beneficial effect of reducing progression of visual field loss (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pharmacologic therapy</HEADING>
<P>Treatment of glaucoma usually begins with topical antiglaucoma medications. First-line medical treatment has consisted of a topical beta-blocker that reduces IOP by decreasing aqueous humor formation or a topical prostaglandin analog that increases the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marquis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Valk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Valk 2005</LINK>). These agents are used as initial treatment because they are effective, have relatively few ocular adverse effects, and can be used once or twice daily without affecting pupil size or accommodation. Second-line drugs include alpha-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). These medications may cause ocular irritation and must be used twice or three times daily. Parasympathomimetic (miotic) agents such as pilocarpine are considered third-line treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). These agents affect pupil size or accommodation, are used two to four times daily, and are reserved for use in patients who do not respond to other topical antiglaucoma medications. Medical interventions for POAG are the subject of a published Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Vass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vass 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Laser therapy</HEADING>
<P>An alternative or additive treatment to glaucoma medication is laser trabeculoplasty (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>). Laser trabeculoplasty lowers IOP by mechanically stimulating the trabecular meshwork to reduce its resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane review on laser trabeculoplasty for OAG has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Rolim-de-Moura-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolim de Moura 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incisional surgery</HEADING>
<P>If the patient's IOP cannot be controlled with medications, incisional filtering surgery can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>). Filtering surgery reduces IOP by creating a new channel that improves the outflow of the aqueous humor. Trabeculectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure. An opening created in the anterior chamber angle allows the aqueous humor to flow from the anterior chamber into a space beneath the conjunctiva under the surface of the eye. The most common problem associated with this surgery is the growth of scar tissue, which may cause an obstruction in this artificial channel that blocks aqueous humor drainage, and the IOP-lowering effect may decrease gradually with time. Other vision-threatening complications include overfiltration, hypotony, bleeding, and infection.</P>
<P>In addition to trabeculectomy, nonpenetrating surgical procedures such as viscocanalostomy and deep sclerectomy have been developed. These techniques avoid full-thickness penetration into the anterior chamber of the eye. Fewer complications have been reported, but their effectiveness in lowering IOP may be limited compared with that of trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Netland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Netland 2001</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review comparing medical and surgical interventions for glaucoma has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Glaucoma drainage devices</HEADING>
<P>Tube and plate drainage devices could be used to maintain drainage of aqueous humor in spite of subconjunctival scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 1998</LINK>). Glaucoma drainage devices are usually recommended in cases where trabeculectomy is unlikely to succeed. A Cochrane systematic review of these devices has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Minckler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other procedures</HEADING>
<P>Alternative microsurgical procedures performed on the trabecular meshwork such as trabecular aspiration, goniocurettage, laser trabecular ablation, and trabeculotomy have been described as means of lowering IOP in OAG. These techniques are not widely used, and their safety and effectiveness are not known (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although many treatments are available, glaucoma is a chronic condition for which no cure is known. Some patients may seek complementary or alternative medicine such as acupuncture to supplement their regular treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture is a branch of traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for more than 2000 years in the treatment of various illnesses. In traditional Chinese medicine, the body is seen as representing a delicate balance of two opposing and inseparable forces: yin and yang. Yin represents the cold, slow, or passive principle, and yang represents the hot, excited, or active principle. An imbalance in these two opposing forces is associated with blockage in the flow of Chi (vital force or energy), which leads to various illnesses. Chi flows along pathways known as meridians with acupuncture points on the human body that connect with them (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2007</LINK>). The underlying philosophy of acupuncture is that disorders related to the flow of Chi can be prevented or treated by stimulating the relevant acupuncture points on the body surface. These points are stimulated typically by inserting needles; however, related techniques such as manual (acupressure), electrical, or laser stimulation of acupuncture points are often included under this term (<LINK REF="REF-Rhee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhee 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact mechanism of the effects of acupuncture is far from clearly delineated. People have tried to explain how acupuncture works within the framework of Western medicine. Of the different mechanisms of action proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Cho-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffet 2006</LINK>), the dominant one suggests that acupuncture stimulates the release of neurochemicals (usually endogenous opioids or serotonin). "Gate theory" or segmental effects is another proposed mechanism for analgesia. In the "gate theory," sensory input from acupuncture blocks or interferes with nociceptive pain signals at the spinal level. In addition, involuntary body functions may be regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Examples of such functions include heart rate, blood pressure, postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms, and respiration. By incorporating the results from studies on different body systems treated with acupuncture, a model termed the broad sense hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (BS-HPA) axis was proposed recently. This model hypothesizes that the central nervous system is essential for processing the effects of acupuncture by modulating the autonomic nervous system, the neuroimmune system, and hormone regulation. Different mechanisms proposed so far might be viewed as part of an elaborate interaction among different systems of the body.</P>
<P>Animal models and small samples of human studies have explored ocular effects associated with acupuncture. Studies have reported potentially beneficial effects of IOP reduction, improvement in central visual acuity, increased ocular blood flow, preservation of normal waveform characteristics of multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), alteration of visual function tested by the visual evoked potential (VEP), and increased retinal nerve growth factor (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naruse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naruse 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sagara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagara 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed included studies for four types of bias.

<BR/>
<B>
<I>1. Selection Bias</I>
</B>: Selection bias, in the context of RCT, refers to "systematic differences between baseline characteristics of the groups that are compared (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)." We assessed the method of sequence generation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>2. Performance Bias</I>
</B>: Performance bias refers to "systematic differences between groups in the care that is provided (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)." We examined masking of outcome assessment, in which persons responsible for assessing outcomes were unaware of the assigned intervention. In our opinion, masking of participants and care providers may not be feasible in trials on this topic, and hence is not used as a measure of quality.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>3. Attrition bias</I>
</B>: Attrition bias refers to "systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a study (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)." We assessed follow-up times and losses to follow-up in each group. We examined reasons for losses to follow-up (e.g., withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations) and how losses of participants were handled. We also assessed whether the analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, that is, whether participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomly assigned.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>4. Detection bias</I>

<P>We followed the guidelines in Chapter 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>) pertaining to data synthesis. For dichotomous outcomes, we planned to calculate a summary risk ratio. For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate the mean difference. Before combining the data, we planned to assess clinical and methodologic heterogeneity by examining the characteristics and methodologic quality of each trial. To assess the amount of statistical heterogeneity, we planned to use forest plots, results of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for statistical heterogeneity, and the value of I<SUP>2</SUP>. If no substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected (i.e., I<SUP>2</SUP> value less than 50%), and if no clinical or methodologic heterogeneity is noted among trials, we planned to combine the results in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. A fixed-effect model will be used if is three or fewer trials are used. If substantial heterogeneity is present, we will not combine study results but will present them in a tabulated summary.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Her-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Her 2010</LINK> compared auricular acupressure, a nonstandard acupuncture technique, versus a sham procedure for glaucoma in 33 patients: 16 patients with 28 glaucoma eyes in the acupressure group, and 17 patients with 32 glaucoma eyes in the sham group. We described details of this trial in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>The trial included 33 participants 30 years of age or older who had primary open-angle glaucoma, chronic angle-closure glaucoma, normal tension glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or secondary glaucoma in one or both eyes and had been treated for at least one year.</P>
<P>The trial excluded patients if they had the following surgeries or conditions: laser trabeculoplasty or filtering surgery for glaucoma in the past, persistent ocular inflammation within the past year, use of any systemic medication that affects the IOP within three months, end-stage glaucoma with impending phthisis bulbi, or no detectable IOP because of poor psychological condition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Participants were randomly assigned to the auricular acupressure group or the sham group. Patients in the acupressure group received "stimulator tapping" and massage of the "auricular points (kidney, liver, and eye) over the right ear at our first course of outpatient clinic." Tapping stimulation was administered. Over a four-week period, patients regularly massaged their ears using thumb and index finger "twice per day for nine minutes each time (three minutes/each point)." At four weeks' follow-up, patients stopped acupoint tapping and no further massages were given. Patients in the sham group received "stimulator tapping but no massage at the sham auricular points." All other treatment modalities were the same as those used for the acupressure group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The trial assessed IOP, uncorrected visual acuity, and best corrected visual acuity before and after the massage at the patient's first clinic visit and at one, two, three, four, and eight weeks' follow-up.

<P>In the existing literature, the term <I>acupuncture</I> embraces a variety of stimulation techniques including different types of acupuncture needles used, electrical or laser stimulation with or without needle acupuncture, application of moxibustion with acupuncture, and acupressure without needling. In addition, different acupuncture points or groups of points and different intensity, duration, and frequency or repetition rate of stimulation were studied under the same category of acupuncture. This clinical heterogeneity made comparisons or analyses of studies on acupuncture almost impossible.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Her-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Her 2010</LINK> did not report between-group comparisons for any outcomes examined in the trial. We re-analyzed data reported at four weeks and eight weeks.</P>
<P>At four weeks&#65293;the time point at which acupressure treatment stopped&#65293;comparison of the acupressure group with the sham group revealed that the between-group difference in IOP (measured in mm Hg) was -3.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) -7.11 to -0.29; P = 0.044) for the right eye and -4.90 (95% CI -8.08 to -1.72; P = 0.006) for the left eye. The difference in uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA, measured in logMAR) was -0.01 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.22; P = 0.932) for the right eye and -0.04 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.19; P = 0.747) for the left eye. The difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, measured in logMAR) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.26; P = 0.236) for the right eye and 0 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.14; P = 1.000) for the left eye.</P>
<P>At eight weeks&#65293;the longest follow-up time point in the study&#65293;comparison of the acupressure group with the sham group revealed that the between-group difference in IOP was -1.30 mm Hg (95% CI -4.78 to 2.18; P = 0.474) for the right eye and -2.30 mm Hg (95% CI -5.73 to 1.13; P = 0.202) for the left eye. The difference in UCVA was -0.03 logMAR (95% CI -0.27 to 0.21; P = 0.812) for the right eye and -0.16 logMAR (95% CI -0.43 to 0.11; P = 0.261) for the left eye. The difference in BCVA was -0.04 logMAR (95% CI -0.09 to 0.17; P = 0.565) for the right eye and -0.04 logMAR (95% CI -0.18 to 0.10; P = 0.589) for the left eye.</P>
<P>No statistically significant difference in IOP or visual acuity was noted at any other follow-up time points.</P>
<P>We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this review because we found only one completed RCT.</P>
<P>Our search revealed a few case series of small sample size. We believed it would be inappropriate to summarize the results from these case series because the search strategy employed was not designed to identify nonrandomized studies. In addition, the methodologic limitations made it impossible to quantify the magnitude of the effect.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-18 11:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tianjing Li">
<P>Acupuncture, which originated in China more than 2000 years ago, is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2007</LINK>). Over the past two decades, acupuncture has grown in popularity in the United States and in other Western countries. According to the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2004</LINK>), 8.2 million US adults had used acupuncture, and 2.1 million had used it during the previous year.</P>
<P>In accordance with this trend, some glaucoma patients may seek acupuncture as a supplement or an alternative to their traditional glaucoma management. One completed trial suggests that although IOP in the acupressure group was statistically lower than that in the sham group at four weeks' follow-up, the difference was not statistically significant at any other follow-up time points, including the longest follow-up time (eight weeks). Further, the difference in visual acuity between the two groups was not statistically significant at any follow-up time points. These results should be interpreted carefully because the trial was rated as at high risk of bias for masking of outcome assessors. Inadequate masking of outcome assessors may introduce information bias. All together, the limited information from RCTs highlights the gap in existing evidence. The effectiveness of acupuncture as a therapeutic modality for glaucoma could not be firmly established at this point. Inclusion of the seven Chinese trials that are classified as "awaiting assessment in the future" may change this conclusion.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-18 09:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tianjing Li">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-04-18 09:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At this time, it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of glaucoma. Most glaucoma patients currently cared for by ophthalmologists do not use nontraditional therapy; therefore clinical practice decisions will have to be based on physician judgments and patient preferences, given this lack of data in the literature.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-18 09:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tianjing Li">
<P>Because of ethical considerations, RCTs comparing acupuncture alone with standard glaucoma treatment or placebo are unlikely to be justified in the near future in countries where the standard of care has already been established. However, trials in which acupuncture in combination with another glaucoma treatment is compared with the other glaucoma treatment alone might be of interest. It would be valuable for researchers and clinicians who are experienced in acupuncture to agree on certain basic standards for administration of acupuncture in clinical trials. Adequate data on IOP, central visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual field changes, optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer analysis, ocular blood flow, pattern electroretinography (PERG), multifocal ERG, visual evoked potential (VEP), multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP), potential harms, visual-related quality of life, and economic outcomes will facilitate appropriate evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture.</P>

<P>"Patients in the acupressure group received &#8216;stimulator tapping&#8217; and massage of the auricular points (kidney, liver, and eye) over the right ear at our first course of outpatient clinic. Tapping stimulation was administered using a 1-mm alloy ball (Magrain; Sakamura, Kyoto, Japan) designed for acupressure, which was applied to the surface of the auricular acupoints. Subsequently, over a 4-week period, patients regularly massaged their ears using thumb and index finger (squeezing each side of the ear with inward pressure from opposing finger and thumb) twice per day for 9 minutes each time (3 minutes/each point). A regular follow-up was performed and the side for tapping, left ear or right ear, was alternated weekly. After 4 weeks of follow-up, tapping of the acupoints was discontinued and no further massages were given. The investigators re-evaluated IOP, uncorrected visual acuity, and best corrected visual acuity at the 8-week follow-up conducted at the clinic. Patients in the sham group received stimulator tapping but no massage at the sham auricular points (wrist, shoulder, and jaw). All other treatment modalities were the same as those for the acupressure group."</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Method used to generate random sequence was not described in the article. After contacting the author, we received the following information: "We used computer to generate 40 (our original expected patient collection numbers) simple randomized allocation sequences. We then assigned patients to 'control' or 'trial' group according to their clinic visit order. So we knew the next patient would be assigned to which group, but we didn't know who would be the next one (patient's visit order was arranged by the clinic assistant, who didn't know the randomized allocation sequences). The patient him-/herself would not know which group he/she would be assigned."</P>
