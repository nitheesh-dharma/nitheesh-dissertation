<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In many countries, influenza vaccination is an accepted part of routine immunisation recommendations particularly in persons 65 years and over, those in long-term care facilities and also adults and children with chronic illnesses including those with bronchiectasis. In this review however, our search for randomised control trials examining the effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people with bronchiectasis revealed no relevant studies. In the absence of evidence, patients' needs should be individualised and national guidelines be adhered to. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries. In affluent countries, bronchiectasis is increasingly recognised in certain subsections of communities (e.g. Aboriginal communities) as well as a coexistent disease/comorbidity and disease modifier in respiratory diseases such as COPD (reported rates of 29-50% in adults). Respiratory exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis are associated with reduced quality of life, accelerated pulmonary decline, hospitalisation and even death. Current recommendations for inactivated influenza vaccination includes adults aged 65 years and over, those in residential care and health care workers and also all adults and children with chronic illness, particularly cardiac and pulmonary diseases. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-21 11:52:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiectasis, previously termed an 'orphan disease' is increasingly recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Karadag-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karadag 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Karakoc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karakoc 2001</LINK>) and in pockets of affluent countries (<LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Callahan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2003</LINK>). The underlying aetiology of bronchiectasis varies from post recurrent respiratory infections to rare immune deficiencies. A variety of diseases including the common chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Patel--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>) and less common respiratory diseases (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>) and sarcoidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>)) and even non-primary respiratory (e.g. autoimmune) diseases may culminate in the development of bronchiectasis. The presence of bronchiectasis increases the morbidity and mortality of the underlying primary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Patel--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>). For example, bronchiectasis has been reported in 29-50% of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Patel--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>) and when present, increases the severity (<LINK REF="REF-Patel--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>) and frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Gursel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gursel 2006</LINK>) of respiratory exacerbations. Thus, management of the symptoms and severity of bronchiectasis is important. </P>
<P>The dominant symptoms and signs of bronchiectasis are productive or wet cough, dyspnoea on exertion and presence of other respiratory signs (clubbing, chest wall deformity, respiratory noises such as wheeze or crepitations on auscultation). In the long term, pulmonary decline may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Twiss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twiss 2006</LINK>). Like patients with COPD, children and adults with bronchiectasis also suffer from recurrent acute exacerbations, some of which require hospitalised treatment. Effective management regimes for bronchiectasis aim to reduce the frequency and severity of respiratory exacerbations and the rate long term pulmonary decline. Based on Cole's 'vicious circle hypothesis', microbial colonization/infection is important in the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis as it leads to bronchial obstruction and a normal or exaggerated inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>). Thus treatment modalities that prevent or limit respiratory infections would prevent or reduce respiratory decline. Respiratory infections also increase morbidity and reduces quality of life in those suffering bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Garcia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Garcia 2005</LINK>). Theoretically prevention of influenza through the use of influenza vaccine would be a useful routine management modality for children and adults with bronchiectasis. Indeed yearly influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both inactivated and live attenuated (LAIV) influenza vaccine are now available. Both are annually modified trivalent vaccines with adjustments for each of the major circulating influenza viruses: A (H3N2), A (H1N1) and B and administered annually (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2005</LINK>). The efficacy is directly related to the degree of concordance between the virus strains included in the vaccine and the strains circulating in the community. The inactivated vaccine contains killed viruses and is administered via intramuscular route and is recommended in those 6 months and older, in healthy individuals and those with chronic medical conditions. The newer LAIV contains live virus with potential for replication and is currently only recommended in healthy individuals aged between 5 and 49 years (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2005</LINK>), thus contraindicated in those with bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>Current recommendations for inactivated influenza vaccination includes adults aged 65 years and over, those in residential care and health care workers and also all adults and children with chronic illness, particularly cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Influenza vaccine has been estimated to be 70-90% effective in preventing influenza in healthy individuals under 65 years of age, with some reduction in efficacy in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2005</LINK>). A meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies involving both nursing home populations and community-dwelling elderly estimated effectiveness of 56%, 53%, 50% and 68% for preventing respiratory illness, pneumonia, hospitalisation and death, respectively. The efficacy of influenza vaccination in children is less known, though it has been estimated to provide 56% or more protection (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 2004</LINK>). The effect of influenza vaccine in preventing asthma exacerbations related to influenza is uncertain in patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>). In another Cochrane review, Poole and colleagues concluded that influenza vaccination reduces respiratory exacerbations in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>). The effect size described in the meta-analysis of RCTs was similar to that of observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>The triggers for bronchiectasis exacerbations are less well studied compared to the available data on triggers of exacerbations for asthma and COPD. The proportion of bronchiectasis exacerbations triggered by infections is uncertain, much less the culprit microbiological organism. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination for bronchiectasis may thus, be rather different to that for asthma and COPD. Influenza vaccination may be associated with local and systemic adverse events including a flu-like illness (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>). A systematic review of the effectiveness of influenza for children and adults with bronchiectasis would be beneficial to guide clinical practice. </P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-07-20 14:01:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>It was planned that trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria would have been reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible subjects), inclusion and exclusion criteria, other symptoms, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of intervention, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data would have been extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information would have been requested from the authors when required.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-20 14:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Studies included in the review would have undergone quality assessment performed independently by two reviewers. Four components of quality would have been assessed. Risk of bias in included studies would have been assessed as either high, low or unclear risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), and the following headings 1) sequence generation; 2) allocation concealment; 3) blinding; 4) incomplete outcome data; 5) selective outcome reporting; 6) other bias. While only the allocation concealment quality assessment would have been displayed in the meta-analysis figures, all assessments would have been included in the "Characteristics of included studies" table. Inter-reviewer reliability for the identification of high quality studies for each component would have been measured by the Kappa statistic.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-07-20 15:12:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, odds ratio (OR) would have been calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies of all the individually analysed studies examine whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) is reasonable. This would take into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>

<P>The Airways Group specialised register/search identified 289 potentially relevant titles. After assessing the abstracts, four publications were considered for inclusion into the review including two non-English articles (French). None of the studies fulfilled study criteria. No additional studies were found in the review articles. No additional data were available from the five pharmaceutical companies contacted (CSL Limited, Sanofi Pasteur Pty Limited, Chiron Vaccines Australia Pty Ltd, GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd, Solvay Pharmaceuticals).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-21 11:52:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No randomised controlled trials comparing any influenza vaccines in children or adults with bronchiectasis were identified. </P>
<P>Based on many rationales including the risk factors of severe influenza infections, yearly influenza vaccination is widely recommended for patients with chronic respiratory disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Cosgrove-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosgrove 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2006</LINK>). However there is no RCT evidence that has examined whether annual influenza vaccination is indeed beneficial in patients with bronchiectasis. The Cochrane review on influenza vaccination for patients with COPD described that "inactivated influenza vaccination has a clinically important and significant effect on influenza-related exacerbations, and probably an effect on the total of exacerbations in COPD patients" (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>). Given the wide overlap between COPD and bronchiectasis, where up to 50% of patients with COPD have coexistent bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Patel--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>), it is arguably justified that until new evidence to the contrary exist, patients with bronchiectasis should be routinely vaccinated. However influenza vaccinations are not without risks and adverse events although mostly minor, may be serious (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2005</LINK>). Thus, in the absence of good evidence for the benefits of annual routine influenza vaccination, individual preferences and risk factors for increased adverse events should be considered. Furthermore, the argument of policy versus evidence for influenza vaccination was recently elegantly discussed by Jefferson (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>In patients with asthma and COPD, Cochrane reviews have shown that inactivated influenza vaccinations do not cause an immediate respiratory exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>). Whether immediate respiratory exacerbations is increased in patients with bronchiectasis post inactivated influenza vaccinations is unknown; it remains a theoretical risk in the context of the common occurrence of mild immune dysfunction in patients with bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-King-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2006</LINK>). In the consideration of possible future uses of LAIV (which is currently used only in healthy individuals and hence not currently relevant in this target group), the risk of viral shedding for several days, especially in children (<LINK REF="REF-Cosgrove-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosgrove 2005</LINK>) must also be taken into account.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-21 14:14:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-21 14:14:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>There is neither evidence for nor against, routine annual influenza vaccination for children and adults with bronchiectasis from randomised controlled trials. Given the recommendations of the Cochrane review on influenza vaccination in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2006</LINK>), and the significant overlap between COPD and bronchiectasis, current recommendations for annual influenza vaccination in patients with bronchiectasis is justified. However, individual responses and risk for adverse effects need to be taken into account when considered for routine annual influenza vaccination.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Acknowledging the difficulty in conducting large, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of repeated influenza vaccination in patients with bronchiectasis, it would still appear desirable to do so. There is also little knowledge on the effects of annual revaccination in this target group. Multi-centre randomised controlled trials to establish the efficacy of influenza vaccination in reducing severity and frequency of respiratory exacerbations and pulmonary decline in people with bronchiectasis are needed. As responses to vaccines alters with age, cohorts should comprise of different age groups including young children (aged under 2 years), children, adults and older adults. Determining true influenza infections from the range of other influenza-like illnesses by microbiological and serological techniques is recommended. </P>
