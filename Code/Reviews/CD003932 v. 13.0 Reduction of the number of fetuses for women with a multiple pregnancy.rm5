<P>
<B>What is the issue? </B>
</P>
<P>Women expecting twins, triplets or more, face a higher risk of complications. There are increased risks to the woman, and to their babies, during pregnancy, birth and afterwards. For example, the babies are more likely to die before or after birth, to be born preterm, or to have serious and sometimes long-lasting difficulties. It is possible to reduce the number of fetuses during pregnancy by terminating one or more of them. This is called pregnancy reduction or fetal reduction. This intervention aims to improve the health of the remaining fetus or fetuses. Parents and healthcare providers need evidence that shows clearly whether reducing the number of fetuses leads to better outcomes, and what the risks may be.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Pregnancy reduction is a very difficult decision for parents. Parents need a full picture of the possible outcomes. Without studies to show if termination is likely to benefit the remaining fetus or fetuses, and what the risks may be, it is harder to make a fully-informed choice.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found no studies for this Cochrane review (search date 31 July 2015) and so we do not know if the baby or babies who remain after fetal reduction have better outcomes or if there are any risks in the procedure. Evidence from other types of studies does exist but there are problems with making sense of the data.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>For the present, we cannot be sure whether pregnancy reduction does lead to better outcomes for the remaining fetuses, and by how much. We cannot be sure which particular outcomes improve, and what risks may arise. In the future, we may get a better picture, with a different type of study which takes into account parental preference, and which tracks the results. In the meantime, parents can come to a decision about whether they want the option of pregnancy reduction after discussion with their midwives and doctors. The discussion will take into account how acceptable the parents find the intervention, and what outcomes they are hoping to achieve.</P>

<P>We found no available data from randomised trials to inform the risks and benefits of pregnancy reduction procedures for women with a multiple pregnancy. While randomised controlled trials will provide the most reliable evidence about the risks and benefits of fetal reduction procedures, reduction in the number of fetuses by selective termination may not be acceptable to women, particularly couples with a past history of infertility. The acceptability of this option, and willingness to undergo randomisation will depend on the couple's social background and beliefs, and consequently, recruitment to such a trial may prove exceptionally difficult.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-04 15:25:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:06:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is a worldwide variation in the incidence of multiple pregnancies, ranging from 6.7 per 1000 births in Japan, to 40 per 1000 births in Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2010</LINK>). The incidence of monozygous twins is relatively constant at 3.5 per 1000 births, while the incidence of dizygous twins and higher-order multiple pregnancies varies with maternal age, parity, ethnicity and use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1988</LINK>). The risk of multiple pregnancy from ART correlates directly with the number of embryos transferred, occurring in 17.9% of in vitro fertilisation pregnancies after transfer of two embryos, and increasing to 24.1% after transfer of four embryos (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 1996</LINK>). Similarly, multiple pregnancy is more common the more oocytes eggs transferred (18.7% following transfer of two oocytes and 25.8% following transfer of three oocytes) (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 1996</LINK>). Complications and risks for both mother and babies with twin pregnancies are well recognised and increase further for triplet or higher-order multiple pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2010</LINK>). There is concern too for long-term morbidity in survivors.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-06 08:40:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When couples are faced with the dilemma of a multiple pregnancy there are three options. Termination of the entire pregnancy has generally not been acceptable to women, especially for those with a past history of infertility. Attempting to continue with all the fetuses with the inherent problems of preterm birth, survival and long-term morbidity. The other alternative is reduction in the number of fetuses by selective termination. The acceptability of these options for the couple will depend on their social background and underlying beliefs. This review focuses on reduction in the number of fetuses.</P>
<P>Techniques have been advocated to reduce multiple pregnancies (two or more developing babies), with the aim of reducing poor obstetric and perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, poor growth of the babies, and death of one or more of the babies (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1994b</LINK>). First trimester fetal reduction has been carried out using both transabdominal (where the needle is placed through the woman's abdominal wall) and transvaginal (where the needle is placed through the woman's vagina) approaches. These pregnancy reduction procedures involve either the aspiration or disruption of the gestational sac by gentle suction or the injection of potassium chloride (KCl) into the chest of the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1994b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-04 15:25:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There are many non-randomised cohort data available, describing the effects of fetal reduction procedures. A number of prospective, non-randomised studies have assessed pregnancy outcomes from pregnancy reduction with twins (conceived spontaneously or following assisted reproductive techniques) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groutz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groutz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansour-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 1999</LINK>); from pregnancy reduction with expectant management of a triplet pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Boulot-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulot 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulot-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipitz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipitz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansour-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porreco-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porreco 1991</LINK>); and assessing transcervical or transvaginal procedures with transabdominal procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Berkowitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkowitz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulot-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulot 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shalev-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shalev 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>From a methodological perspective, the quality of the prospective cohort studies identified were generally poor, with eligibility criteria poorly stated. Women were offered reduction in the number of fetuses in the pregnancy in an inconsistent manner, based primarily on whether or not the procedure was offered by the women's treating doctor. Allocation of women to each treatment group was based on the preference of the woman and her partner. There was limited reporting of important clinical outcomes, with data available from a single trial only for many of the outcomes considered. All of these factors severely limit the reliability of any results and conclusions that can be made due to the potential for bias.</P>
<P>However, the findings from these studies and from a meta-analysis of prospective non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2004</LINK>), suggest that pregnancy reduction to twins versus expectant management for women with a triplet pregnancy appears to be associated with a reduction in pregnancy loss, antenatal complications, birth before 36 weeks, caesarean birth, low birthweight infants, and neonatal death. Outcomes from pregnancy reduction to twins appear comparable with those obtained from twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously or after assisted reproductive techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2004</LINK>). Although reduction of a twin pregnancy to a singleton is reported to be increasingly common (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2007</LINK>), the effect on the risk of pregnancy complications is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Hasson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-23 14:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>While the available non-randomised literature suggests that fetal reduction is associated with a reduction in risk of pregnancy loss, preterm birth and other pregnancy complications, the nature of the study design raises potential for risk of bias. This review aims to assess the effects of pregnancy reduction for women with a multiple pregnancy on fetal loss, preterm birth and its complications, and perinatal and neonatal mortality and morbidity from randomised trials. The preferences women have of expectant management and pregnancy reduction need to be considered as does the psychological impact of such a procedure.</P>

<P>We planned to include outcomes in the analysis if data were available according to original allocation and reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias. Only outcomes with available data would have been presented in the analysis tables although the lack of data in these areas would have been noted in the body of the text. We would have extracted and reported as subsidiary outcomes data that were not pre-stated. These would have been clearly labelled as not pre-specified. The possibility has to be borne in mind that such outcomes are only reported because the difference between the groups, which is a result of chance, have reached conventional levels of statistical significance. In order to minimise the risk of bias, we planned to base the conclusions solely on the pre-stated outcomes.</P>

<P>There were no randomised controlled trials identified that compared outcomes after pregnancy reduction with expectant management for women with a multiple pregnancy.</P>
<P>While randomised controlled trials will provide the most reliable evidence regarding the risks and benefits of pregnancy reduction procedures, reduction in the number of fetuses by selective termination may not be acceptable to women, especially for those with a past history of infertility. The acceptability of this option, and willingness to undergo randomisation will depend on the couple's social background and beliefs, and consequently, recruitment to such a trial may prove exceptionally difficult. However, studies have suggested that for some couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, fetal reduction is an option they would consider (<LINK REF="REF-Garel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munks-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munks 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-20 06:07:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While pregnancy reduction for women with a multiple pregnancy appears to be associated with a reduction in pregnancy loss, antenatal complications, birth before 36 weeks, caesarean birth, low birthweight infants, and neonatal death, and outcomes from multifetal pregnancy reduction appear comparable with those obtained from pregnancies conceived spontaneously or after assisted reproductive techniques, the evidence is drawn from non-randomised studies, associated with potential bias.</P>

<P>While randomised controlled trials will provide the most reliable evidence about the risks and benefits of pregnancy reduction procedures, reduction in the number of fetuses by selective termination may not be acceptable to women. The acceptability of this option, and willingness to undergo randomisation will depend on the couple's social background and beliefs, and consequently, recruitment to such a trial may prove exceptionally difficult. In this context, a prospective patient preference trial, with adherence to strict eligibility criteria may provide more information about the risks and benefits of this procedure.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2012-08-01 09:51:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>I wonder why the published studies of Evans 2001 and 1998, Boulot 2000, Macones 1993, and Berkowitz 1996 were not included in the review. Important evidence was thus lost.</P>
<P>This review states that "There are insufficient data available to support a policy of pregnancy reduction procedures for women with a triplet or higher order multiple pregnancy." The literature used for this review is rather outdated, excluding more recent work. Below are references to prospective trials and reviews which present evidence that reducing the number of fetuses to two is of benefit.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review concludes that there is almost no evidence, that RCTs are needed and that "reduction in the number of fetuses by selective termination may not be acceptable to women, especially for those with a past history of infertility". In my experience this is not true! In my practice we face the dilemma of how to deal with requests for fetal reduction from women with a triplet pregnancy. If after transfer of 3-4 embryos women have a triplet pregnancy, they ask for reduction to twins as they have been told there is evidence this has a better outcome.  I searched the literature to support my opinion that today fetal reduction is no longer warranted in developed countries. Unfortunately I found evidence to support fetal reduction. Therefore I am left wondering why the Cochrane review did not identify this evidence.<BR/>

<P>Thank you for your comments. Consistent with our pre-specified protocol, the aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms associated with fetal reduction derived from randomised controlled trials. We have clarified statements relating to the available evidence to clearly indicate that there are no randomised trials on which to base clinical decisions in this area. The studies referred to are largely case control and retrospective cohort studies, and the methodology and design of these studies mean that they have a high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. Data will be entered into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and checked for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we plan to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data are balanced across groups or are related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we plan to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigate the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we find.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we plan to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>We plan to use the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Early pregnancy loss (less than 20 weeks' gestation) (loss as a direct result of the reduction technique will be a subcategory).</LI>
<LI>Stillbirth (death greater than 20 weeks' gestation and before birth).</LI>
<LI>Very preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation).</LI>
<LI>Need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.</LI>
<LI>Neonatal death and serious infant morbidity (defined as growth restriction; seizures; birth asphyxia defined by trialists; neonatal encephalopathy; disability in childhood).</LI>
<LI>Maternal death and serious maternal morbidity (e.g. admission to intensive care unit, infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion).</LI>
<LI>No surviving child.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Data permitting, we will asses the quality of the evidence for our main comparison: reduction in the number of fetuses versus expectant management.</P>
<P>We will use <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes will be produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but using different methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We will not include cross-over trials; this design is not feasible for this intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. In future updates, if eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I² is greater than 30% and either a Tau² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identify substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we plan to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects may differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if so, we will use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Gestational age at the time of fetal reduction (prior to 14 weeks' gestation versus after 14 weeks' gestation).</LI>
<LI>Method of approach (transabdominal versus transvaginal/transcervical).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The following outcomes will be used in subgroup analysis.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Early pregnancy loss (less than 20 weeks' gestation).</LI>
<LI>Stillbirth (death greater than 20 weeks' gestation and before birth).</LI>
<LI>Very preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We plan to carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any difference to the overall result.</P>
