<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Penicillin reduces the risk of streptococcal throat infections and attacks of rheumatic fever in people who have already had a bout of rheumatic fever</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Rheumatic fever is a rare complication of throat infection, that can damage the heart. People who have had rheumatic fever can suffer from it again following streptococcal throat infection if they do not receive regular penicillin. Penicillin for prevention can be given by injection or as tablets. Taking tablets is easier but might not work as well as injections. The review of trials compared different ways of giving penicillin. Penicillin seemed to work better as injections than as tablets. Injections given every two or three weeks worked better than when given every four weeks. However, more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with a history of rheumatic fever are at high risk of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever and developing rheumatic heart disease following a streptococcal throat infection. Giving penicillin to these people can prevent recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease. However, there is no agreement on the most effective method of giving penicillin. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of penicillin compared to placebo and the effects of different penicillin regimens and formulations for preventing streptococcal infection and rheumatic fever recurrence.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1997 to June 2009), EMBASE (1998 to June 2009), LILACs (1980 to June 2009) and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field.</P>

<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine studies were included (n=3008). Data were not pooled because of heterogeneity. Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was poor. Three trials (n= 1301) compared penicillin with control. Only one of three studies showed that penicillin reduced rheumatic fever recurrence (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92) and streptococcal throat infection (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97). Four trials (n=1098) compared intramuscular with oral penicillin and all showed that intramuscular penicillin reduced rheumatic fever recurrence and streptococcal throat infections compared to oral penicillin. One trial (n= 360) compared 2-weekly with 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin. Penicillin given every two-weeks was better at reducing rheumatic fever recurrence (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.83) and streptococcal throat infections (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.85). One trial (n= 249) showed 3-weekly intramuscular penicillin injections reduced streptococcal throat infections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92) compared to 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intramuscular penicillin seemed to be more effective than oral penicillin in preventing rheumatic fever recurrence and streptococcal throat infections. Two-weekly or 3-weekly injections appeared to be more effective than 4-weekly injections. However, the evidence is based on poor quality of trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-09 16:05:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Rheumatic fever is the most important cause of acquired heart disease in children and young adults worldwide. It is an inflammatory reaction that occurs approximately 10 to 21 days after throat infection with virulent strains of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. It affects large joints (arthritis), the heart (carditis) and less frequently the brain (chorea), skin (erythema marginatum) and subcutaneous tissues. Rheumatic heart disease refers to the functional and structural changes of the heart muscle and valves affected by rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever has a marked tendency to recur following new group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection. Recurrence has a high risk of chronic heart lesions or worsening lesions in patients with previous rheumatic heart disease. The severity of rheumatic heart disease and the prognosis depend on the extent of the carditis and the frequency of recurrent attacks. There is much evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the primary prevention of rheumatic fever or the treatment of pharyngitis caused by Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GAS) but less data is available concerning secondary prevention of the disease.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Worldwide, over 12 million people are affected by rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and about 400 000 deaths result from rheumatic heart disease annually (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_ISFC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/ISFC 1995</LINK>). The occurrence of rheumatic fever has declined dramatically in developed countries over the last 100 years to a prevalence of 0.6-0.7 per 1000 population in the USA and Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Brice-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brice 1998</LINK>), although isolated outbreaks have been reported in affluent communities in the United States in recent times (<LINK REF="REF-Veasey-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veasey 1987</LINK>). The prevalence of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is high in areas with poor socioeconomic conditions, overcrowding and limited access to medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Longo_x002d_Benza-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longo-Benza 1998</LINK>). The reduction in prevalence of rheumatic fever in developed countries preceded the introduction of antibiotics and is probably related to the improvement in these non-medical factors.</P>
<P>In contrast, rheumatic fever remains a major cause of acquired heart disease in developing countries and poor communities (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hakim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayosi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayosi 1996</LINK>) where rheumatic heart disease prevalence rates of 19.2-24 per 1000 have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Carapetis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carapetis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaren-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 1975</LINK>). It has been estimated that in developing countries almost twice as many children have rheumatic valvular heart disease as congenital heart disease, a pattern that was observed in the United States over 40 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1993</LINK>). In these countries rheumatic fever occurs in a much younger age group than in developed countries and severe chronic valvular heart disease develops early (<LINK REF="REF-Halim-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halim 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padmavati-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padmavati 1978</LINK>). The option of valve replacement is not available in most instances. As a result rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease cause serious disability, premature death and significant healthcare expenditure in developing countries.</P>
<P>Rheumatic fever complicates untreated by Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection in 0.1 to 0.3% in the general population and 3% in epidemics in closed communities (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1961</LINK>). However, the incidence of rheumatic fever following GAS infection rises to 50% in those with a previous experience of rheumatic fever. This underscores the importance of secondary prevention in individuals with a previous history of rheumatic fever.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention</HEADING>
<P>Prevention of rheumatic fever may be considered to be prevention of the initial attack (primary prevention) or prevention of recurrent attacks (secondary prevention). It has been argued that true primary prevention of rheumatic fever depends more on improvement of socioeconomic factors and education directed at the public and health workers (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 1996</LINK>) than provision of antibiotics. However, a primary prevention programme of parenteral penicillin treatment for all streptococcal throat infections instituted in Costa Rica in the 1970's was successful in eliminating rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="REF-Arguedas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arguedas 1992</LINK>). The subject of primary prevention of rheumatic fever and treatment of streptococcal sore throat has been reviewed recently (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zwart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwart 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary prevention is particularly important since even an asymptomatic or optimally treated GAS throat infection can still trigger rheumatic fever recurrence. Therefore concentrating on prompt diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal throat infections on its own is not adequate. The options for secondary prevention are the use of a vaccine against GAS and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. Unfortunately, the availability of a vaccine is still several years away and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is the only option available at the moment. There is data to suggest that continuous regular antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent or significantly reduce the development of valvular damage, the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease with disappearance of pre-existing heart murmurs (<LINK REF="REF-Stollerman-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stollerman 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompkins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompkins 1972</LINK>) and reduction in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Majeed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeed 1992</LINK>). The importance of secondary prevention is well appreciated and several programmes have been established in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most recent recommendations on the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever have been published by the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis and Kawasaki Disease of the Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 1956</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1995</LINK>) and the World Health Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Both recommend penicillin as the drug of choice for secondary prevention, given as daily oral tablets or as 3-weekly or 4-weekly intramuscular injections. Three-weekly injections are recommended in areas with a high incidence of rheumatic fever or in high-risk groups. This recommendation is based on pharmacokinetic data ( <LINK REF="REF-Currie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meira 1993</LINK>) and results of trials and observational studies ( <LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1987</LINK>;).</P>
<P>The wide choice of penicillin regimens given in current recommendations indicates the uncertainty and controversy regarding the most effective regimen for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever. Some authorities consider intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin to be more effective than tablets taken every day (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). However, due to the perceived higher risk of anaphylaxis and the dangers associated with the reuse of needles still practiced in some poor communities and the discomfort of intramuscular injections, there is resistance to the use of intramuscular penicillin. The safety issues regarding the use of penicillin injections have resulted in government orders prohibiting penicillin injections in hospitals and clinics (<LINK REF="REF-Padmavati-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padmavati 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to summarise the evidence for the use of penicillin for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever and to identify the most effective penicillin regimen. This information will be of help to policy makers, health practitioners and researchers in this area.</P>

The trial durations ranged from 1 to 12 years.

<P>Rheumatic fever recurrence: The basis for diagnosing rheumatic fever was the Jones criteria in the earliest study (<LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>), modified Jones criteria in (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1964</LINK>) and the revised Jones criteria for the latest studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Kassem-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassem 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Streptococcal throat infections: Streptococcal throat infections were reported as either clinical infection, positive throat culture or raised serological markers. The serological test done initially was antistreptolysin O titre (ASOT). In cases where throat culture and ASOT were positive, serial ASOT, hyaluronidase and antistreptokinase were taken. In our data extraction, we took positive throat culture and serology as evidence for streptococcal throat infection. This was based on the fact that a positive throat culture on its own may be due to throat carriage without infection.</P>
<P>Compliance: This was assessed by one or all of the following means: interview, tablet counts or average number of injections missed. However, although six of the studies assessed compliance, only two reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1964</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was poor. Treatment allocation was not adequately described in 3 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>) and was not described at all in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kassem-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassem 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>). The other methods of treatment allocation were dependent on the day of the week the patient was seen (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>) or on odd or even hospital numbers allocated in an alternating sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>). The study by Lue et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>) is reported as 3 separate publications and summarises results of a 12-year prospective follow-up study. Allocation to intervention group was initially done on the basis of odd or even hospital numbers but children recruited between 1985 and 1991 were allocated on the basis of random permutations. It was not possible to sort out results by method of treatment allocation.</P>
<P>In the later study of Feinstein (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>), 216 of the 343 patients were admitted from the previous trial (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>) and they stayed in the groups to which they had been previously allocated. In the study by Feinstein et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>), seventeen patients initially allocated to intramuscular penicillin were transferred to oral penicillin because they were not willing to continue receiving injections. This would have introduced contamination. The outcomes of these patients were not given separately, so it was not possible to perform intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Blinding is not possible when injections are compared to oral tablets and in all comparisons the authors do not indicate whether outcome assessment was blind.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completion of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Follow up completion was not reported consistently in the studies. Padmavati et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>) reported a 25.8% drop out rate. In the study <LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>, of the 267 patients initially randomised, 18 were lost to follow up and were not accounted for in the final result.</P>

<P>Please see list of comparisons and figures. Nine studies were included (n=3008). Three trials (n= 1301) compared penicillin with control, 4 trials (n= 1098) compared intramuscular with oral penicillin, 1 trial (n= 360) compared 2-weekly with 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin and 1 trial (n= 249) compared 3-weekly with 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin. There was no statistical heterogeneity between the studies. However, the results were not pooled because of differences in trial methodologies and the patient characteristics across studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral or intramuscular penicillin versus control</HEADING>
<P>One thousand three hundred and one (1301) patients were included in the three studies, 645 receiving penicillin and 656 receiving no preventive treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>). Results from all three studies showed 15 rheumatic fever recurrences among patients receiving penicillin and 43 among those receiving control, in total. Penicillin reduced the risk of rheumatic fever recurrence by 55% compared to control in one study (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>).

The other 2 studies showed similar results but the differences were not statistically significant. One study reported no significant difference in mortality due to progression of heart failure or acute carditis (RR 1.52, 95%CI 0.78 to 2.99) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.23, 95%CI 0.78 to 1.94) between the penicillin and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intramuscular versus oral penicillin</HEADING>
<P>One thousand and ninety-eight (1098) patients were included in the four studies, 561 receiving intramuscular penicillin and 537 receiving oral penicillin.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-09 16:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Findings</HEADING>
<P>There are three principal findings of this review. Firstly, the available evidence is in favour of penicillin compared to no treatment in the prevention of repeated attacks of rheumatic fever. One of three studies comparing penicillin to no preventive treatment showed a 55% reduction in the recurrence of rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>), whilst the other two revealed a non-significant trend in favour of penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>). Secondly, the evidence seems to be even stronger for intramuscular versus oral penicillin where all the four studies showed a 87% to 96% reduction in rheumatic fever recurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1964</LINK>) and a 71% to 91% reduction in streptococcal throat infection (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>). Thirdly, the evidence from this review suggests that more frequent injections are more effective in preventing rheumatic fever recurrence than 4-weekly injections. This evidence is strong for 2-weekly injections with an almost 50% reduction in the risk of rheumatic fever recurrence and a 40% reduction in streptococcal throat infections compared to 4-weekly injections (<LINK REF="STD-Kassem-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassem 1996</LINK>). The evidence for 3-weekly injections is less strong and may be even weaker if we take into account the systematic error introduced by inadequate randomisation and allocation concealment in the study by Lue and others (<LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, for all comparisons, the evidence is based on studies that were not properly randomised. This may have resulted in bias in treatment allocation. The effect of this would be to exaggerate the true effect of penicillin and of injections compared to tablets. Furthermore, there was marked variation in terms of the geographical areas, time periods and more importantly, the trial methodologies and penicillin dosage schedules used in the various studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The oral penicillin doses and schedules differed between the studies. In three studies penicillin tablets were given every day (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>), in one study tablets were given during the first 7 days of every month (<LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>), in one study tablets were given only during the first 10 days of every month (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>) and in one study penicillin or another antibiotic was given as and when necessary for streptococcal throat infections (<LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>). The earlier studies used an old preparation of penicillin, potassium penicillin G (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>). Phenoxymethyl penicillin (penicillin V), the oral penicillin preparation used today, is more consistently absorbed and produces high blood levels. There is evidence to suggest that this form of penicillin results in low frequency of rheumatic fever recurrence comparable with benzathine penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-Phair-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phair 1973</LINK>). Therefore results drawn from this review may not apply to current oral penicillin preparations.</P>
<P>Taking tablets is more convenient for patients. However, it is easier to ensure compliance with medication administered by injection. It is therefore possible that the better results with injections were simply because this route of penicillin administration assured compliance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes reported</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported streptococcal throat infections and rheumatic fever recurrence. Rheumatic fever recurrence was diagnosed using the widely accepted Jones criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1944</LINK>). The trials provided data on serological markers of streptococcal throat infection (antistreptolysin O, antistreptokinase and hyaluronidase). Serological markers on their own do not confirm infection. In this review a diagnosis of streptococcal throat infection was based on the combination of a positive throat culture and a rise in any of the serological markers. This made it possible to differentiate throat carriage and true streptococcal throat infections.</P>
<P>One limitation of this review is the lack of data on the clinically relevant outcomes of disappearance of heart murmurs, resolution of valve lesions, mortality due to heart failure and adverse events. Observational studies suggest that oral penicillin is safer than parenteral penicillin in terms of allergic and anaphylactic reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Idsoe-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idsoe 1968</LINK>). The International Rheumatic Fever Study Group, a prospective cohort study from 11 developing countries, showed a 0.2% incidence of anaphylactic reactions with a fatality rate of 0.05% (<LINK REF="REF-IRFSG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">IRFSG 1991</LINK>). When viewed in the light of the evidence in favour of penicillin injections from this review, this data suggests that the long-term benefits of prophylactic penicillin injections outweigh the risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>Studies included in the review were conducted in Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Kassem-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kassem 1996</LINK>), Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Lue-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lue 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padmavati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Padmavati 1973</LINK>) and the United States of America (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohn-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1964</LINK>). The baseline risks of rheumatic fever were different depending on the geographical area, time period when studies were conducted and host factors in the populations studied and the inclusion criteria used in each study. This would limit applicability of the results in general.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Intramuscular penicillin seemed to be more effective than oral penicillin in preventing rheumatic fever recurrence and streptococcal throat infections. Two-weekly or 3-weekly injections appeared to be more effective than 4-weekly injections. Even though trials in this review were of poor quality, the evidence is quite strong and it is reasonable to promote current guidelines which are based on this evidence until further evidence becomes available. There have been anecdotal reports of sudden deaths following benzathine penicillin injections given to people with no prior history of penicillin allergy. In some communities this has led to the public and health care workers to prefer oral penicillin. If current guidelines for rheumatic fever secondary prevention are to be implemented, the safety and quality of penicillin injections needs to be assured. Public health education attempts should focus on increasing awareness among patients with rheumatic fever on the need for regular continuous antibiotic prevention and to inform them of the options available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1.In view of the poor quality of the available evidence, well-designed randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of penicillin injections with oral phenoxymethylpenicillin are required. Such studies should be of long duration to allow them to measure the clinically important outcomes of resolution of heart murmurs, improvement in signs and symptoms of heart failure and reduction in mortality and cost-effectiveness of the different treatment regimens. </P>
<P>2.Pharmakokinetic studies have demonstrated that penicillin injections given every 2 or 3 weeks ensure penicillin levels above minimum inhibitory concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meira 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stollerman-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Stollerman 1952</LINK>). These findings are in support of the 2-weekly or 3-weekly injections. There is still a need for well-designed multi-centre randomised controlled trials to compare 2-weekly, 3-weekly and 4-weekly penicillin injections. </P>
<P>3.Regarding the safety of intramuscular penicillin, there is need to set up surveillance and adverse drug reactions monitoring systems. Penicillin injections administered with a local anaesthetic cause less discomfort and there is a suggestion that it may be associated with fewer sudden deaths. This is a question that also needs to be addressed in future trials.</P>
<P>4.Patients with rheumatic fever and their families should be involved in discussions to set research priorities that answer questions relevant to their needs.</P>
