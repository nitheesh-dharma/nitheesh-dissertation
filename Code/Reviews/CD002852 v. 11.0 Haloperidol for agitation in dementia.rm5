<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-09-12 11:55:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">No evidence has been found of any significant general improvement in manifestations of agitation, other than aggression, among demented patients treated with haloperidol, compared with controls</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Agitation is common in demented patients, and often takes the form of wandering, crying out, and aggression. It is presumed to reflect subjective distress and is associated both with risks to the patient and an increase in caregiver burden. In the present study haloperidol treatment was associated with a lower degree of aggression than was placebo. Adverse effects occurred more frequently in haloperidol treated patients than controls, but similar drop-out rates among treated and control patients suggested that for some patients adverse effects may have been tolerated because of better control of behaviour. Our findings indicated that there is little evidence to support a benefit of haloperidol on manifestations of agitation other than aggression, and that haloperidol should not be used routinely to treat patients with agitated dementia. Treatment of agitated dementia should be individualized, with careful monitoring of benefits and adverse effects. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-10-04 10:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Agitation occurs in up to 70% of demented patients. Haloperidol has been used for decades to control agitation in dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Previous meta-analyses examined only English language publications or compared haloperidol with other drugs rather than with placebo. To study the effectiveness of haloperidol a more widely based review was performed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether evidence supported the use of haloperidol in agitated dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 10:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A> - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 2 June 2010 using the term: haloperidol.</P>
<P>The search of June 2010 retrieved no studiies for inclusion and/or exclusion within the review.</P>
<P>The previous searches of July 2005 and January 2008 retrieved no new studies for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with concealed allocation, where subjects' dementia and agitation were assessed. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Two reviewers extracted data from included trials<BR/>2. Data were pooled where possible, and analysed using appropriate statistical methods<BR/>3. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated<BR/>4. Only 'intention to treat' data were included<BR/>5. Analysis included haloperidol treated patients, compared with placebo</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The five included trials led to the following results:<BR/>1. There was no significant improvement in agitation among haloperidol treated patients, compared with controls.<BR/>2. Aggression decreased among patients with agitated dementia treated with haloperidol; other aspects of agitation were not affected significantly in treated patients compared with controls. <BR/>3. Although two studies showed increased drop-outs due to adverse effects among haloperidol patients, there was no significant difference in drop-out rates, comparing all haloperidol treated patients with controls.<BR/>4. The data were insufficient to examine response to treatment in relation to length of treatment, degree of dementia, age or sex of patients, and cause of dementia. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>1. Evidence suggests that haloperidol was useful in reducing aggression, but was associated with adverse effects; there was no evidence to support the routine use of this drug for other manifestations of agitation in dementia.<BR/>2. Similar drop-out rates among haloperidol and placebo treated patients suggested that poorly controlled symptoms, or other factors, may be important in causing treatment discontinuation.<BR/>3. Variations in degree of dementia, dosage and length of haloperidol treatment, and in ways of assessing response to treatment suggested caution in the interpretation of reported effects of haloperidol in the management of agitation in dementia.<BR/>4. The present study confirmed that haloperidol should not be used routinely to treat patients with agitated dementia. Treatment of agitated dementia with haloperidol should be individualized and patients should be monitored for adverse effects of therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-16 12:22:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Agitation has been defined as "inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not explained by needs or confusion per se" (<LINK REF="REF-Billig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989a</LINK>), and has been reported to occur in up to 70% of patients with dementia. No specific link has been found between the kind of agitation (e.g., wandering, assault, crying out) that patients displayed and the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia have been more likely to wander than other demented patients, but this may be because the motor skills of people with Alzheimer's Disease are retained longer than for others. Studies of the effect of medications on agitated dementia, including benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, beta-blocking agents, and anticonvulsants, have given varying results. The first meta-analysis of the treatment of agitated dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1990</LINK>) was a 1966-1989 English language review that examined controlled trials of the effect of several neuroleptics, including haloperidol, and found a modest overall beneficial effect from haloperidol, in comparison with placebo. A 1998 meta-analysis examined multiple drugs, including haloperidol, associated with the control of agitated dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Lanctot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanctot 1998</LINK>) and found no significant difference in efficacy among the interventions examined, and no difference in the pooled mean dropout rates. <LINK REF="REF-Lanctot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanctot 1998</LINK> searched MEDLINE 1965-1995, and considered only English language studies. Most recently, an unpublished meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Stehli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehli 2000</LINK>) covering the years 1966-1999 examined the effect of haloperidol versus placebo, or compared with other neuroleptics, on agitated dementia, but was limited to English language publications and a search of the MEDLINE/Healthstar database. <LINK REF="REF-Stehli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehli 2000</LINK> concluded that, at best, haloperidol provided only a modest improvement in the control of agitation, mostly limited to one factor - hostility/suspiciousness. She further noted a need to use standard outcome measures and to explore the connection between haloperidol and amelioration of specific manifestations of agitation (e.g. hostility, hallucinations, delusions).</P>
<P>Haloperidol belongs to a family of medications known as "neuroleptics". These may modify dopamine receptors (D2 type), although the precise mechanism of haloperidol's influence on agitation is not known. Haloperidol is among the oldest and most widely used drugs for the control of agitated states, including those due to dementia or psychosis, although its use has declined with the emergence of newer antipsychotics. The drug has been distributed internationally for decades, but there is no quantitative estimate available of its application to agitated dementia. Haloperidol was initially favoured because of a lower rate of adverse reactions than for similar drugs. However, significant side effects continue to be a problem with this medication. These include over-sedation, hypotension, involuntary movements (including tardive dyskinesia), parkinsonian manifestations (rigidity, tremor), and the rare occurrence of high fever and vascular collapse (malignant neuroleptic syndrome).</P>
<P>Haloperidol was first used in the 1960s for the control of psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, delusions, and agitated behavior. Despite more than 7000 publications on the drug since its introduction, only a handful of reports have described its use in the control of agitated dementia. In part because of the difficulty in carrying out studies on demented patients with agitation, and in part because of the complex nature of symptoms of agitation, clear guidelines for the use of haloperidol in agitated dementia have been difficult to establish. Other factors contributing to this difficulty include a lack of well controlled studies, the absence of a clear definition of agitation, and a failure of some investigators to rule out agitation due to causes other than dementia (e.g., delirium, infection, drug reaction). To provide reliable guidance to clinicians, studies of the use of haloperidol in controlling agitated dementia should always have demonstrated that treatable causes of agitation, especially delirium, were excluded by a medical or psychiatric examination prior to entering patients into experimental trials.</P>
<P>The present study updates and extends the earlier meta-analyses, and also attempts to identify the difficulties that make interpretation of results unclear in publications on this subject. The review is limited to the effect of haloperidol versus placebo on agitated dementia.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>These included all relevant unconfounded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation of subjects. Trials had to include pre- and post- treatment assessment of agitation. Because dementia is characterized by varying rates of progression, if cross-over studies were reported only data from the first part of the study were included. Both English and non-English language publications were examined.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-09-16 12:22:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>These were patients with dementia, unclassified or diagnosed according to the major classifications given below, and having agitation.</P>
<P>Diagnostic criteria for dementia: these were given in <LINK REF="REF-DSM-IV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM IV 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-ICD_x002d_10-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD-10 1993</LINK>, and included Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, Pick's dementia; dementia associated with Parkinson's disease; dementia due to alcoholism; and unclassified dementia. Studies prior to 1994 used criteria for dementia found in DSM IIIR and DSM III. In the absence of these criteria, other acceptable evidence (e.g., Mini Mental State Examination, psychiatric evaluation, medical evaluation, psychologic evaluation) of dementia was used.</P>
<P>Diagnostic criteria for agitation: neither DSM IV nor ICD-10 provided diagnostic criteria for agitation.</P>
<P>A commonly accepted description of agitation was "inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not explained by needs or confusion per se." (<LINK REF="REF-Billig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>), and includes wandering, crying out, abusive vocalization, and assaultive behavior. Studies in which the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1996</LINK>) was used for pre- and post- treatment assessment of agitation and to measure response to treatment were subjected to meta-analysis. Where the CMAI was not used, other evidence - such as a description of the manifestations of agitation - was accepted in reviewing the literature.</P>
<P>There had to be evidence that clinical investigation was undertaken to rule out treatable causes of agitation (e.g., infection, drug reaction, dehydration) prior to entering patients in the drug trial. Because acute confusion (delirium) and agitated dementia may share similar behavioural manifestations, it was important to rule out delirium as the cause of agitation.</P>

<LI>Identification of studies:</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. Searching and screening of the results were performed independently by two reviewers (ETL, JL).<BR/>2. The reviewers selected trials for relevance and against defined inclusion criteria. Trials that did not fulfil the criteria were excluded.<BR/>3. The reviewers' selection of trials was compared and the final list of studies was reached by consensus between the reviewers or adjudicated by a third reviewer(<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inclusion criteria:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were ranked using one of the Cochrane approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment (randomization; placebo-controlled; concealed allocation).<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain.<BR/>Grade C: Inadequate concealment; no randomization.<BR/>Trials with inadequate concealment have been shown to overestimate treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>) and in this review were excluded.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data extraction:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data were sought on every patient randomized (irrespective of compliance and of withdrawal) for each outcome measure in order to conduct 'intention-to-treat' analyses. Where such data were unavailable, data for 'on-treatment analysis' were extracted and indicated as such. For continuous variables, or ordinal variables which can be approximated to continuous variables, the main outcomes of interest were the assessment score at the time point considered, and the change from baseline (i.e., pre-randomization or at randomization) at this point. For some binary and ordinal outcomes, such as the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), the end point itself was of clinical relevance, because all patients had, by definition, the same initial score. The baseline assessment score was the latest available score, no longer than one month prior to the randomization. Studies could have included a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. Because patients were not randomized, nor was treatment allocation concealed, data from titration periods were not used to assess safety or efficacy of haloperidol. For the same reason, data from any open follow-on phase, after randomization, were not used to assess safety or efficacy. Data on adverse events and drop outs were recorded.</P>
<P>Where present, numeric scores such as those provided by Cohen-Mansfield (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1996</LINK>), were used to measure response to treatment. In addition, where available, further measurements such as Global Clinical Scales or other scalar assessments of agitation (e.g. MOSES) were reviewed. Because of wide variation in the way response to treatment was measured, it was necessary in some instances to operationalize outcomes as simply 'improved' versus 'not improved', regardless of the scale used by the authors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Analysis of data</LI>
</UL>
<P>The null hypothesis tested was that, for the outcomes examined, haloperidol has no effect compared with placebo.</P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Scale, there were two possible approaches. If ordinal scale data appeared to approximate a normal distribution, or if the analysis suggested that parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data. The second approach (which did not exclude the first) was to concatenate into two categories which best represented the contrasting states of interest and to treat the variable as binary.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes the endpoint itself was of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio was used. A test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials was made using a standard chi-square statistic. If no heterogeneity was indicated then a fixed effect parametric approach was taken.</P>
<P>Within-class efficacy of treatment was examined by subgroup, as follows:<BR/>1. Dementia subtype (e.g., Alzheimer's compared with Vascular dementia).<BR/>2. Kind of agitation (e.g., crying out compared with assault compared with wandering).<BR/>3. Severity of dementia as determined by the Mini-mental state score (e.g., mild:19-16; moderate:15-10; severe:9-untestable), or other appropriate measures.<BR/>4. Sex of patient<BR/>5.

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-03-05 14:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There were five included trials. These are summarized as follows:<BR/>1. Three studies were multicentre; two studies were from Europe; three studies were from the United States; three studies involved outpatients; two studies involved institutionalized patients.<BR/>2. The average age of participants ranged between 72.1 years and 81.5 years; women made up 56.3% to 66.6% of the patients studied.<BR/>3. Identification of dementia: all studies used one or more standard methods (DSM IIIR, <LINK REF="REF-DSM-IV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM IV 1994</LINK>, NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>)) to diagnose dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia. Three studies were limited to Alzheimer's dementia, and two studies included other forms of dementia as well (e.g. due to stroke).<BR/>4. Characterization of dementia: In four studies patients were described as having mild to moderate dementia based on MMSE scores ranging from a mean of 13.0 - 19.4 (<LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK>), or on DSM IIIR criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK>) the patients had severe dementia, as measured by MMSE scores of 7.9 - 8.8.<BR/>5. Characterization of agitation and outcome measures: three studies used the CMAI scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1996</LINK>) to assess agitation and response to therapy; two studies used the MOSES scale (<LINK REF="REF-Helms-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helms 1988</LINK>); two studies used the BPRS scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>); one study used the ABID inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Logsdon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logsdon 1999</LINK>).<BR/>6. Haloperidol dosage varied across the studies from 0.25 mg per day to 6.0 mg per day. Duration of therapy varied from 3 weeks to 16 weeks. Three studies titrated the dose of haloperidol. Patients receiving varying doses of haloperidol were titrated up to the maximum dose unless improvement or intolerable adverse effects appeared. In <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK> subjects were started at 0.5 mg per day (one unmarked tablet) and increased by 0.5 mg per day at the next clinic visit up to 3.0 mg per day unless they showed improvement in agitation, or adverse effects appeared. If adverse effects appeared the dosage was reduced by 0.5 mg per day. In <LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK> subjects were begun on 0.25 mg per day and increased by 0.25 mg per day every four days to a total of 1.0 mg twice daily unless improvement or adverse effects occurred. In <LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK> subjects were begun on 2.0 mg per day and increased by 0.5 mg doses to 6.0 mg per day unless improvement or adverse effects occurred. In <LINK REF="STD-Auchus-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auchus 1997</LINK> all treated patients received haloperidol, 3.0 mg per day, and in <LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK> there were two groups of patients: one group received 0.5 mg to 0.75 mg per day, with the other group receiving 2.0 to 3.0 mg per day.<BR/>7. Measurement of adverse effects: in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Auchus-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auchus 1997</LINK>) the investigators applied their own checklist to identify adverse effects. The three other studies applied different established side effect rating scales: the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK>); the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, (<LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK>); the Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TES), theTargeting Abnormal Kinetic Effects Scale, and the Rockland Tardive Dyskinesia scale (<LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>).<BR/>8. Three studies compared the effect of haloperidol on agitated dementia against the effect of placebo or against the effect of another intervention (behavioural management techniques, trazodone, tiapride, risperidone, fluoxetine). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>) the effect of low dose haloperidol (0.5 to 0.75 mg per day) was compared with standard dose haloperidol (2.0 to 3.0 mg per day) and both doses were compared with placebo treatment.<BR/>9. Two studies measured change in caregiver burden. <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK> used the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) and the Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCG); <LINK REF="STD-Auchus-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auchus 1997</LINK> used the University of Iowa Caregive Stress Inventory (CSI).<BR/>10. All included studies described analyses based on "intention to treat."<BR/>11. All studies excluded patients who had other reasons for agitation, including alcoholism, schizophrenia, mania, and depression, but only <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK> specifically mentioned delirium as a cause of exclusion from study.<BR/>
<BR/>Outcome Measures:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Agitation</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1996</LINK>) scale is widely used in nursing homes to assess agitation. The scale examines 29 types of agitated behaviour, including pacing, verbal or physical aggression, performing repetitious mannerisms, screaming, and general restlessness. The frequency of these behaviours is measured on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (never occurs) to 7 (occurs several times an hour, and includes cluster scores for physical and verbal aggression, and total aggression.<BR/>2. The Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) (<LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1989</LINK>) examines 25 items and uses a four-point scale of increasing severity to assess seven clusters of behaviour: paranoid/delusional ideation; aggressiveness; hallucinations; activity symptoms; diurnal rhythm symptoms; affective symptoms; and anxieties and phobias. An aggressiveness subscale score sums three symptoms scores: verbal outbursts; physical threats, violence or both; and other kinds of agitation (e.g., wandering, thrashing about).<BR/>3. On the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>), the 'hallucinatory behavior or unusual thought content' item is used to identify psychotic behavior with a score of at least (moderate severity).<BR/>4. The Agitated Behavior Inventory for Dementia (ABID) (<LINK REF="REF-Logsdon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logsdon 1999</LINK>) is a scale employed by caregivers of patients. It measures 16 items (e.g., aggression, vocalization) according to frequency of occurrence (0, did not occur; 3, occurred daily or more often), and the reaction of the caregiver to the problem (0 = not upsetting; 4 = extremely upsetting).<BR/>5. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1978</LINK>) measures hallucinations, delusional behaviour, psychomotor activity, and a number of manifestations linked to depression, mania, anxiety, and formal thought disorders (e.g., incoherence, illogical thinking, flight of ideas). .<BR/>6. The Behavioral Syndromes Scale for Dementia (BSSD) measures physical aggression (e.g., hitting, verbal abuse) or psychomotor agitation (e.g., restlessness, repetitive movements); a score of 4 or more is the criterion for disruptive behaviour.<BR/>7. The Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) (<LINK REF="REF-Helms-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helms 1988</LINK>) measures self-care functioning items, disoriented behaviour, depressed/anxious mood, irritable behaviour, and withdrawn behaviour. Aggressive behavior is measure with the Irritable Behaviour subset of items (e.g., resisting care, verbal abuse of staff, physical abuse with staff or others). Frequency is measured as 'not at all' or 'at least once a day on more than 3 days'.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Caregiver burden</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB) (<LINK REF="REF-Vitaliano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitaliano 1991</LINK>) provides a 25 item checklist to give two scores: objective burden (number of items checked), and subjective burden (degree of caregiver distress). Positive scores represent worsening of caregiver burden. Examples of objective burden include items such as "I have little control over my spouse's behaviour," and "My spouse has struck me on various occasions." Caregiver distress is measured with the Beck Depression Inventory.<BR/>2. The University of Iowa Caregiver Stress Inventory (CSI) measures the burden of demented patients on their families and significant others.<BR/>3. The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMPBC) (<LINK REF="REF-Teri-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teri 1992</LINK>), in which caregivers rate 24 problems on two lists: frequency of problems and caregiver distress from each problem. A five point scale is used for each list. Global scores and sub scale scores (memory-related, depressive, and disruptive) are derived from the two lists.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Global change</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1997</LINK>) is a seven point scale (1 - very much improved; 4 - no change; 7 - very much worse) which makes a global rating of all aspects of the patient's condition, comparing the current state with the baseline, and using direct observation as well as information from significant others to determine the score.<BR/>2. The Functional Assessment Staging Scale (FAST) (<LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1988</LINK>) measures the level of basic activities such as bathing, dressing, and toileting, through 16 stages, ranging from independent to totally dependent.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Side effects</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. The Udvalg Kliniske Undersogelser scale (UKU) (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerd-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerd 1987</LINK>) identifies a broad range of side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor, hyperkinesia, akathisia), endocrine symptoms (e.g., libido changes, vaginal discomfort), psychic events (e.g., impaired concentration, sleepiness, nervousness), neurologic events (e.g., dystonia, muscle rigidity), and autonomic events (e.g., change in blood pressure), and includes subscales as well as total scores.<BR/>2. The extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>) is a 55-item scale to measure the severity of parkinsonian symptoms (e.g., hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, tremors, excess salivation), dyskinetic movements (e.g., of head, limbs, tongue), and a global estimate of tardive dyskinesia (e.g., athetoid movements of the tongue).<BR/>3. The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TES) measures systemic adverse effects (e.g. temperature, changes in blood pressure).<BR/>4. The Targeting Abnormal Kinetic Effects (TAKE) scale examines extrapyramidal signs.<BR/>5. An unstandardized measure of adverse effects by <LINK REF="STD-Auchus-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auchus 1997</LINK> summed the total number of adverse events, including depression, anxiety, difficulty walking and nervousness for each patient.<BR/>6. An unstandardized checklist of adverse effects was developed by <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK>, and the frequency of adverse events among the different treatment arms was measured at week 17. Adverse events included parkinsonian gait, dry mouth, akathisia, rigidity, dyskinesia, drowsiness, bradykinesia, tremor, and fatigue.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Two reviewers (ETL, JL) independently estimated the quality of the included studies. The Cochrane approach to assessing adequacy of allocation concealment was used.</P>
<P>1. Category A (adequate concealment): allocation is determined by: 1) a centralized randomized scheme in which subjects are enrolled at a registry which codes and randomizes the participants and notifies the investigator by telephone about treatment or control group allocation; 2) a randomization controlled by a pharmacy; 3) coded containers with identical appearing capsules which are administered sequentially to participants; 4) an on-site or coded computer, given that allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled subject; 5) the use of sequentially numbered and sealed, opaque envelopes; 6) combinations of the aforementioned.<BR/>2. Category B (unclear concealment): the report describes allocation of treatment by: 1) the use of a list or table to allocate assignments; 2) the use of envelopes or of sealed envelopes to distribute medications; 3) a statement in the report to the effect that the report is randomized without further characterization.<BR/>3. Category C (inadequate): allocation of treatment by: 1) alternation of subjects to treatment or control arms of the study; 2) use of 'fixed data' such as birth dates, record numbers, days of the week; 3) allocation that is transparent such as an open list of random numbers or assignments. Unclear concealment methods have been shown to increase estimates of treatment effects compared with adequate methods of concealment.</P>
<P>Trials conforming to Categories A and B were accepted; trials falling into category C were excluded from further study. </P>
<P>Each of the five included studies satisfied Category B criteria for allocation concealment.. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-05 14:38:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Agitation in demented patients is a complex and difficult problem to manage, and this is reflected in the multiple ways of assessing and treating agitated dementia found in the publications reviewed in this report. Several questions must be addressed in considering haloperidol for the treatment of patients with agitated dementia:<BR/>1. Does haloperidol reduce agitation among demented patients, compared with controls?<BR/>2. Does the degree of dementia influence response to haloperidol treatment?<BR/>3. Do other factors (age, sex, type of dementia, type of agitation) influence response to therapy?<BR/>4. How do dose and duration of therapy affect response to haloperidol in demented agitated patients?<BR/>5. Are side effects more common among haloperidol treated patients?<BR/>6. Do side effects in patients treated with haloperidol result in increased dropout rates?</P>
<P>Analysis of the results failed to demonstrate that haloperidol had a significant general effect in controlling agitation in patients, compared with controls, and therefore cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of this condition.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>) showed a significant improvement in one aspect of agitation, aggression, in haloperidol treated patients. This finding is similar to that of <LINK REF="REF-Stehli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehli 2000</LINK>. Stehli showed little overall improvement in agitation with haloperidol therapy, but found that a single aspect of agitation, hostility/suspiciousness, appeared to respond to haloperidol. Her report was completed prior to the study by <LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK> and was unable to demonstrate any effect of haloperidol on aggression in demented patients. Schneider's early meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1990</LINK>) showed a modest benefit of haloperidol in treating agitated dementia, but in Lanctot's meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lanctot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanctot 1998</LINK>) there was no demonstrated benefit of haloperidol for patients with agitated dementia, compared with controls.</P>
<P>These earlier meta-analyses support our finding that the most important effect of haloperidol may be on individual manifestations of agitation, rather than the syndrome as a whole. Studies which examine the response of the syndrome to treatment, rather than its components, may not be sufficiently focused to detect improvement in specific aspects of agitation in treated patients. Our results and those of Stehli suggest that haloperidol should be used to treat ONE individual manifestation of agitation, NAMELY aggression, rather than be used indiscriminately for any demented patient who has been described as agitated.</P>
<P>The results were insufficient to determine whether degree of dementia, age or sex of patients, or dose and duration of therapy influenced response to haloperidol. In <LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>, patients receiving 2 - 3 mg of haloperidol per day appeared to respond better to treatment than those given 0.5 - 0.75 mg per day, but <LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK> showed an improvement in overall agitation in patients receiving an average dose of haloperidol of 1.2 mg per day, while <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK> found no effect of haloperidol on agitated dementia in patients given a mean dose of 1.8 mg per day.</P>
<P>Haloperidol could not be shown to reduce caregiver burden or to improve physical functioning among treated patients, compared with controls.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis showed adverse effects to be more common among haloperidol treated patients, but only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RIS_x002d_INT_x002d_24-DeDeyn" TYPE="STUDY">RIS-INT-24 DeDeyn</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK>) specified the kinds of adverse effects, demonstrating a significant increase in adverse reactions such as extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and fatigue, compared with controls. Drop-outs due to adverse effects were more common among treated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Allain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK>), but pooled analysis of all five studies showed no significant difference in drop-out rates, comparing all treated and untreated patients. <LINK REF="STD-Teri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teri 2000</LINK> suggested that similar drop-out rates among haloperidol and control patients may represent a beneficial trade-off in which adverse effects were tolerated because of better control of agitation. None of the studies specified reasons for drop-outs among the control patients.</P>
<P>A report by Pelton in 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>), examined haloperidol plasma levels in Devanand's earlier randomized controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Devanand-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Devanand 1998</LINK>) and found that levels of -&gt; 1.5 mg/nl were associated with a 20% or greater reduction in BPRS total scores (P &lt; 0.01) compared with patients having lower plasma levels. Higher haloperidol plasma levels (not specified) were also associated with increased frequency of extrapyramidal adverse effects (P &lt; 0.01). Pelton was unable to demonstrate any association between oral doses of haloperidol and efficacy or side effects, although there was a correlation between oral doses and plasma levels of haloperidol. Because Pelton's study was a post hoc examination of Devanand's clinical trial, and because no placebo group was included in the new analysis, these results must be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, Pelton's report represents an effort to establish the link between patient response and haloperidol treatment on a more scientific basis. An earlier report (<LINK REF="REF-Dysken-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dysken 1994</LINK>) found no correlation between plasma/red blood cell haloperidol levels and either adverse effects of treatment or changes in behavior of patients, but this study involved patients who had had previous exposure to haloperidol, whereas in Pelton's study only one of the patients had been treated with haloperidol at any time prior to entering the trial.</P>
<P>It was difficult to compare results among the studies because of variations in dosage, length of treatment, and ways of assessing response to care. The dosage of haloperidol varied from 0.25 mg per day to 6.0 mg per day. The duration of therapy was from 3 weeks to 16 weeks. Methods of measuring effects of therapy involved application of more than a dozen different assessment scales. It should be stated that the present review failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of haloperidol on agitated dementia. This is not the same as proving that haloperidol has no effect on this condition; further study is needed to test this assertion.</P>
<P>The July 2005 update of the current review revealed no new published studies of the effect of haloperidol on agitation in demented patients, compared with placebo controls, but there has been a growing interest in comparing atypical antipsychotics with haloperidol, most recently in a crossover study comparing the effect of haloperidol with risperidone, and reported by Suh et al (<LINK REF="REF-Suh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suh 2004</LINK>). This emerging area of clinical investigation may offer an opportunity for additional systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the present study</HEADING>
<P>The major limitation was the inapplicability of meta-analysis to the included studies owing to heterogeneity in the degree of dementia of the study subjects, the outcome measures used, the measures of agitation, and in the dosage and duration of haloperidol treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. Meta-analysis of the studies described here showed no significant general improvement of agitated dementia among haloperidol treated patients, compared with controls. Based on these results, haloperidol cannot be recommended for routine use in the control of agitated dementia.<BR/>2. In pooled analysis, haloperidol appeared to reduce aggression among patients, compared with controls, and may be indicated for this feature. There is no convincing evidence in the present study to support the use of haloperidol for other manifestations of agitation among demented patients.<BR/>3. Although adverse events were more common among haloperidol treated patients, and two studies showed increased drop-outs due to side effects, analysis showed no difference in drop-out rates, comparing all treated and control patients. This suggests that adverse effects may be tolerated if the drug is seen as effective in other ways.<BR/>4. Treatment of agitated dementia with haloperidol should be individualized, used only for people displaying aggression, and with careful attention to response to therapy and to the appearance of drug related side effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Studies should be carried out employing standard methods to evaluate agitated dementia and to assess response to treatment. In order to make comparison among studies possible it is recommended that future reports use standard doses of medication and lengths of treatment for patients with agitated dementia. Until better standardization is available to permit comparisons among studies, it is unlikely that further meta-analyses of this subject will provide the kind of information clinicians need.<BR/>2. Information is needed about the relationship between underlying diagnoses and behavioral manifestations as they influence response to therapy in agitated dementia.<BR/>3. The possibility of a beneficial trade-off, in which adverse effects are tolerated because of the effectiveness of treatment in controlling agitation, should be the subject of formal investigation. <BR/>4. Examination of the kind of haloperidol associated symptoms that are associated with drop-outs may lead to better tailoring of therapy for demented patients with agitation. More information is also needed about the reasons control patients discontinue treatment.<BR/>5. The evidence suggested that future research may be more productive if increased focus is placed on individual aspects of agitated dementia (e.g., aggression, hostility/suspicion) rather than on overall response to therapy.<BR/>6. The emergence of new studies comparing atypical antipsychotics with haloperidol in the control of agitation among demented patients suggests a need for further systematic reviews on this subject.<BR/>

<P>17/07/03: An updated literature search revealed no new randomized controlled trials since the last review, and no new evidence to alter the results and recommendations of our report of 2002. A new article (Pelton 2003) described plasma haloperidol levels of an earlier RCT (Devanand 1998), finding that haloperidol plasma levels of -&gt; 1.5 ng/ml, but not doses of haloperidol (range, 0.5 mg/d - 3.0 mg/d), correlated with improvement in agitation as measured by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total scores (P &lt; 0.01), and that higher haloperidol plasma levels were also associated with increased frequency of extrapyramidal side effects. Because the findings were derived from a post-hoc analysis of Devanand's 1998 study, and did not include comparison with BPRS changes among control subjects they must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, the new study represents an effort to establish a more direct link between haloperidol therapy of demented patients with agitation, and patient response (improvement and side effects) to therapy.</P>
