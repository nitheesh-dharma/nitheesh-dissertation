I have generated a risk of bias table as a figure. you gave several of the studies low risk of bias for blinding, but I think they should be unclear. I don't think that it makes much difference because you did not end up doing subgroup analysis by removing studies at high risk of bias or anything, but just though you might like this opportunity to double check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Figures. You had rather a lot of figures and we do not recommend having more than about 6 figures. I deleted the ones that related to asthma and put links in to the analysis instead (these forest plots will be published anyway), but left the exercise induced ones in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effects of interventions, for each analysis, could you write the number of patients the calculation was based on please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Tricia,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sorting out the data. I have removed comparison 3 now, and altered the PEF in Medici as this was in L/s instead of L/min. This makes the results heterogenous so can you check PEF in the three studies. I have also added number of participants to the abstract and Table in the review. Some of the wording has also been adjusted. See what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS please leave the notes in the review (as they do not get published but remain useful)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC November 3rd. This looks much better in overall structure. Where does the SE for Carey come from for the FEV1 data? The paper says P&amp;lt;0.05 and this does not match what shows in the Forest plot? I think the SE should be nearer 0.1 to match the p value in the paper? I think this is nearly done now. I have taken pooling off the sodium excretion results from the trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC FEb 9th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Tricia,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to you at this point. You only need keep analysis 1 and 2. The others are to show the workings. I do not think you need to pool the salt results as this does not mean anything, but please check the units. Reporting the chronic asthma is going to be similar to before. EIA is harder as all the trials are in a laboratory and from the same group of investigators on small numbers, so I think this needs testing in clinical practice before coming to any conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you happy to revise the text and then send me back the review. I am sorry that I told you to halve all the numbers as this messes up the SD/SE calculations in RevMan for the EIA outcomes so I have put them all back to full numbers and tried to check the P values as best I can against the tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions are cautious anyway, but I am happy that this is the best we can do with the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Jan 15th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having entered data for comparison 7 I now realise that more careful thought is needed in terms of which are randomised comparisons and which are not. So the Sodium comparisons (with the nice p values) from Medici turn out not to be randomised as all patients were on sodium citrate in the third arm of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will need more discussion I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing Jan 11th 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for updating this review. I have made some changes as shown in the coloured text. I have cut out the table in the text and moved it to an additional table. You will need to explain why bias is introduced by university students or taking medication prn. I do not see how either of these things would give a &lt;b&gt;wrong&lt;/b&gt; answer to the impact of salt restriction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to make sense of the results I will need to see the workings from the authors please. I know that we have discussed this in the past but I would like to compare the papers with the entered results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;060504 OK'd by Chris&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing by CJC 8th April 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: rather vague!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: new included study mentioned.

This means that outcomes to the left favour a low salt diet BUT the numerical differences are confusing (as the WMD may be shown as negative when a low salt diet has a better lung function than normal diet). I doubt that readers will be able to handle this without confusion and suggest that it would be better to enter the data with low salt diet first in RevMan and change the labels on the graphs to indicate that low salt is better to the right of the line of no effect for lung function outcomes. [This is based on my previous discussions with Paul Jones but Felix may wish to check this with Paul before going ahead and changing the data in the RevMan tables].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Objective confined to reduction of salt (exclusion is not possible in practice).&lt;br&gt;Comment about other reasons for restricting salt removed in reviewers conclusions.&lt;br&gt;Was this high versus normal sodium or high versus low (abstract and results are conflicting on this and the way in which the results are reported)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;How was the crossover data entered into RevMan? Was it entered for first arm only or both arms of the trials?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16/05/2001 Reviewer replies (FR):&lt;br&gt;All data re-entered the conventional Cochrane way as suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: ok revised objective to be reduction of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment about other reasons for restricting salt removed - ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison: this review was: Low sodim versus normal sodium intake &amp;amp; low sodium versus high sodium intake. We believe this is a reasonable as far as such interventions go as to see if low sodium improves asthma compared to normal sodium and if high sodium worsens asthma. The abstract results and main text results are not conflicting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: all of the trials were crossover design and non-reported data from the two arms separatly, therefore only combined (both) arm data entered into RevMan (a statement entered under &amp;quot;Presentation of Result&amp;quot; to this effect).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5/6/2001&lt;br&gt;Thanks Felix,&lt;br&gt;Labels fixed for Serum Sodium and Chloride&lt;br&gt;Old title: ++Dietary salt reduction or exclusion for allergic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Dietary salt reduction or exclusion for allergic asthma UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 16:57:51 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="SALT-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Asthma prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Asthma is a respiratory disease which is characterised by increased airway responsiveness to a wide variety of stimuli and causes variable airflow obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 2002</LINK>). Asthma prevalence has been increasing over recent decades, with 300 million individuals globally reporting asthma symptoms and worldwide. Reports indicate that 255,000 individuals died of asthma in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002c_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO, 2006</LINK>). The prevalence of asthma and atopy (a tendency to experience allergic reactions) is higher in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peat-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peat 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1990</LINK>) than in developing or less affluent countries (<LINK REF="REF-Keeley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Niekerk-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Niekerk 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yemaneberhan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yemaneberhan 1997</LINK>). Some of this difference may be a consequence of differential methods of diagnosing asthma, but there is evidence that asthma appears to be associated with the economic development of a country. One suggestion that might explain the difference in asthma prevalence between countries is that diet is important in the aetiology of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Fogarty-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fogarty 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeever-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeever 2004</LINK>), and one of the characteristics of developed countries is a higher level of dietary sodium intake (<LINK REF="REF-Gleibermann-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleibermann 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 1974</LINK>). This has led to the hypothesis that sodium has a role in the aetiology of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Burney-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1987</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiological and cross-sectional studies</HEADING>
<P>The first studies of the relationship of dietary sodium and asthma were by Peter Burney in the late 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Burney-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burney-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1987a</LINK>). An ecological study (<LINK REF="REF-Burney-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1987a</LINK>) investigated the relationship between the standardised mortality ratio for each area of England and Wales and the amount of table salt purchased. The table salt purchases were estimated by a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food survey. This showed that table salt purchases were strongly and significantly related to asthma mortality. However, this relationship was observed in men (15 to 64 years old, r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.05 ) and children (5 to 14 years old, r = 0.82. P &lt; 0.05 ), but not in women (r = 0.40, P &gt; 0.05 ). In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Burney-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1986</LINK> investigated the relationship between sodium intake and bronchial reactivity. Questionnaires were sent to adults enquiring about symptoms of asthma and bronchial reactivity. Individuals with symptoms and 20% of responders without symptoms had a bronchial histamine challenge and skin prick test performed. Participants also provided 24-hour urinary sodium excretion samples. There was a significant increase in bronchial reactivity (log<SUB>10</SUB>PD<SUB>20</SUB> -histamine) with an increase in 24-hour urinary sodium concentration. There was on average a 10-fold difference in reactivity over the 95% range of sodium excretion recorded in the study. However, a large study (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1994</LINK>) failed to demonstrate any relationship between sodium and bronchial reactivity in 1,702 adults who were randomly selected from a population-based sample. Participants provided data on a methacholine challenge and a 24-hour urinary sodium sample collection was performed. There was no relationship found between 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and methacholine challenge after adjustment for age, smoking and gender.</P>
<P>There have been several cross-sectional studies in different populations throughout the world. These studies have used different definitions of asthma such as patient questionnaires, physicians' diagnosis or bronchial reactivity. The measurement of dietary sodium consumption varies between studies. Some studies used food frequency questionnaires, others used three-day food recall and some used 24-hour urinary sodium which is the most accurate for daily intake. Some of the studies suggest a relationship between dietary sodium and asthma or bronchial reactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Demissie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demissie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohamed-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohamed 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pistelli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pistelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tribe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tribe 1994</LINK>), whereas other studies have not demonstrated any relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Devereux-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sparrow-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparrow 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sausenthaler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sausenthaler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zoia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoia 1995</LINK>;). Therefore, it is unclear at a population level what the role of dietary sodium is on asthma control. Interventional randomised controlled trials are a more robust method to assess the role of dietary sodium on asthma.</P>

<P>We included nine studies with a combined total of 381 participants.

The studies that included people with asthma ranged in size from 17 to 220 participants and the size of the studies with participants who had exercise-induced asthma ranged from 8 to 24. All the studies were cross-over trials which ranged from two to five weeks in each arm, except for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pogson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pogson 2008</LINK> which was a parallel group study of six weeks. The majority of studies placed individuals on a low sodium diet and then intervened with either sodium or placebo tablets. The amount of additional sodium differed between the studies, with supplementation being aimed at producing a sodium consumption similar to the average consumption in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Burney-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burney 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Medici-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Medici 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pogson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pogson 2008</LINK>) or a high supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gotshall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gotshall 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mickleborough-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mickleborough 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mickleborough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mickleborough 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mickleborough-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mickleborough 2005</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:49:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review investigated the effect of sodium manipulation in people with either asthma or exercise-induced asthma. Most of the lung function outcomes improved for people with exercise-induced asthma who were consuming a low sodium diet.<BR/>
<BR/>We were able to pool data from only four studies in patients with asthma and these were mostly studies on small numbers of participants. One included study was larger and involved 220 participants. This large study also demonstrated the lowest risk of potential bias in the design and conduct of the study. The analyses used six different measures of asthma control and the number of participants in each analysis varied from 14 to 239. The only outcome affected by sodium manipulation was the FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio. All other measures were negative despite a significant change in urinary sodium. However, it must be recognised that there was a wide difference in the amount of change in urinary sodium between the different studies depending on the intervention. In addition, patients did not benefit from an improvement in quality of life, however only one study reported on this outcome.<BR/>
<BR/>The four studies in exercise-induced asthma had a small number of participants with between 23 and 59 participants in each analysis. This review found that some lung function parameters for exercise-induced asthma were improved by reducing sodium intake. There were improvements in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC at baseline for individuals when a low sodium diet was compared with a high sodium diet; however these differences in lung function were not demonstrated in the asthma population. The five-minute post-exercise lung function suggests that a low sodium diet may be beneficial for people with exercise-induced asthma, with a large reduction of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 630 mL and FVC of 860 mL. It should be noted that the changes of dietary sodium intake within the exercise-induced asthmatic population were extreme. In 2004 the UK consumption of sodium was estimated as 165 mmol (<LINK REF="REF-Dietary-and-Nutritional-Survey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietary and Nutritional Survey 2004</LINK>) but the high sodium diet group were consuming at least 230 mmol and had changes in urinary sodium of 270 mmol/L between comparison groups. Therefore these changes might only be possible in a RCT environment. Another limitation of the analyses of the exercise-induced asthma is that the mean difference (MD) and standard error (SE) were all derived from the summary data given and therefore did not take account of the paired data. It is also possible that the people with exercise-induced asthma who were predominantly recruited from university students may not represent the general population of people with exercise-induced asthma and therefore the results may not be generalisable to the wider population of people with exercise-induced asthma.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:49:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review suggests that people with asthma may not benefit significantly from altering their dietary sodium intake in order to improve their asthma control. People with exercise-induced asthma might benefit from a reduction of dietary sodium; however the change in dietary sodium needed is extremely large and the clinical significance of this effect is unclear. The effects seen were unique to the exercise-induced asthma population, possibly due to having a different phenotype of asthma and possibly because of the large changes in the sodium consumption they achieved. Therefore these findings could be limited to a small number of people with exercise-induced asthma and the change in sodium may be difficult to achieve and sustain outside a clinical trial environment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:49:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review demonstrates that dietary sodium reduction did not have a significant effect on asthma control within a population of people with asthma. Therefore, no further research in this area is recommended. There appears to be an effect of dietary sodium manipulation on some outcomes of lung function in people with exercise-induced asthma. This could potentially be further investigated in larger studies in order to determine the clinical relevancy of these changes as the changes were inconsistent across different markers of lung functions. In addition, it is not known if these changes persist longer than two weeks.</P>

Medici should be used for low versus normal comparison only. The other two are not randomised and will have to come out I fear. I suggest low rather than high on the basis that only 6 capsules were taken by the patients resulting in about 100mmol of sodium, very similar to Pogson. The urine results would also fit with this. Lieberman can be used for Normal v Lo and data from that study is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed Carey as this is not a randomised dose comparison (only Hi v Lo and FEV1 can be used from Carey)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a good deal of chin scratching I have extracted Medici data from Table 3 using GIV to combine each arm of the paired results for the 9 and 5 participants for each outcome. This has been entered in the analysis. I have also changed the Pogson FEV1 and PEF data to be change from baseline (using Table 2 in the paper) as this is most similar to the cross-over design and avoids problems with baseline imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a look and we can discuss further. I am happy to send the workings to you on an excel spreadsheet or as an RM5 file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:49:16 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
