The ITS studies evaluated the effects of: introducing or changing regulations that laid down safety and health requirements for the construction sites (nine studies), a safety campaign (two studies), a drug-free workplace programme (one study), a training programme (one study), and safety inspections (one study) on fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries. One CBA study evaluated the introduction of occupational health services such as risk assessment and health surveillance, one evaluated a training programme and one evaluated the effect of a subsidy for upgrading to safer scaffoldings. The overall risk of bias of most of the included studies was high, as it was uncertain for the ITS studies whether the intervention was independent from other changes and thus could be regarded as the main reason of change in the outcome. Therefore, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all comparisons.</P><P><I>Compulsory interventions</I></P><P>Regulatory interventions at national or branch level may or may not have an initial effect (effect size (ES) of &#8722;0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) &#8722;2.08 to 1.41) and may or may not have a sustained effect (ES &#8722;0.03; 95% CI &#8722;0.30 to 0.24) on fatal and non-fatal injuries (9 ITS studies) due to highly inconsistent results (I² = 98%).

A multifaceted drug-free workplace programme at the company level may reduce non-fatal injuries in the year following implementation by &#8722;7.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI &#8722;11.2 to &#8722;4.0) and in the years thereafter by &#8722;2.0 per 100 person-years (95% CI &#8722;3.5 to &#8722;0.5) (1 ITS study).

There is very low-quality evidence that introducing regulations as such may or may not result in a decrease in fatal and non-fatal injuries. There is also very low-quality evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections or the introduction of occupational health services may not reduce non-fatal injuries in construction companies. There is very low-quality evidence that company-oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign, a multifaceted drug workplace programme and subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings may reduce non-fatal injuries among construction workers. More studies, preferably cluster-randomised controlled trials, are needed to evaluate different strategies to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures prescribed by regulation.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-01 11:19:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-29 08:44:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>The construction industry is a vital component of the economies of all countries worldwide, employing a considerable workforce. Occupational injuries compromise construction workers' quality of life.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-18 08:39:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), injuries are caused by acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy, heat, electricity, chemicals, and ionising radiation interacting with the body in amounts or at rates that exceed the threshold of human tolerance. In some cases (for example, drowning and frostbite) injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1992</LINK>). Most fatal injuries in construction result from falls from heights and being struck by moving vehicles, while most non-fatal injuries result from falls from heights, slips and trips, and being struck by a moving or falling object (<LINK REF="REF-Atique-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atique 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bentley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK>). Injuries are one of the major causal factors for the high proportion of occupational disability, with a standardised injury ratio of 2.5 compared with the general workforce (<LINK REF="REF-Arndt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arndt 2004</LINK>). The reported risk of a fatal accident in construction workers is five times more likely than in other industries (<LINK REF="REF-Aksorn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aksorn 2008</LINK>).</P><P>Numerous studies from around the world have reported on poor attention to safety during construction and associated fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, including in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Bondy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bondy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoonakker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoonakker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evanoff-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Evanoff 2016</LINK>), the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK>), Taiwan (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2005</LINK>), Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Larsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 2002</LINK>), the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Afrian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afrian 2011</LINK>), and Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Ohdo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ohdo 2014</LINK>). The estimated rates of fatal injury incidence in 2003 were 4 per 100,000 construction workers in the UK and 11.7 per 100,000 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK>). In the UK, this rate is five times higher than the average rate across all industries. In addition, reports show a rate of non-fatal major injury (for example, fractures or eye penetration) of 375 per 100,000 construction workers in the UK from 2002 to 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK>), plus an annual injury incidence rate for any injury leading to absenteeism of 7% in the Netherlands in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Afrian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afrian 2011</LINK>). In one study, 16% of German construction workers were granted a disability pension over the course of 10 years of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Arndt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arndt 2004</LINK>). Eurostat reports the construction industry as the sector with the highest fatal and non-fatal accidents at work (<LINK REF="REF-Eurostat-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eurostat 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Construction injuries have significant financial implications (<LINK REF="REF-Afrian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afrian 2011</LINK>). During a large construction project in the USA, direct workers' compensation costs due to slips, trips and falls ranged from USD 0.04 in insulation work to USD 20.56 in roofing, with an average of USD 4.3 per USD 100 payroll cost (<LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 2006</LINK>). Medical, productivity, supervisory and liability costs further increase the financial losses (<LINK REF="REF-Leamon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leamon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loushine-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loushine 2005</LINK>). The cost of construction-related traumatic injuries further underlines the importance of implementing effective health and safety interventions. Effective interventions for preventing occupational injuries should be the basis of an effective health and safety policy in the construction industry.</P><P>According to <LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK>, the levels of involvement of key factors in accidents in construction are: problems arising from workers or the work team (70% of accidents), workplace issues (49%), shortcomings with equipment (including PPE) (56%), problems with suitability and condition of materials (27%), and deficiencies with risk management (84%).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-29 08:44:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>Although the construction work environment and workforce will vary between projects and over time, interventions for reducing injuries are likely to work in similar ways for most construction projects. <LINK REF="REF-Haslam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslam 2005</LINK> described the following five target areas for interventions according to the elements of a typical construction project: worker and work team, workplace, materials, equipment, and organisation. Regardless of which of these five areas are targeted, there are two major approaches for interventions. These consist of the actual safety measures, such as: protective personal equipment, adequate equipment for working at heights, and risk management; and the strategies used to implement these measures into practice (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Molen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Molen 2005</LINK>). The latter can be further categorised as: compulsory (e.g. regulation), educational (e.g. training in safety procedures), informational (e.g. campaigns for risk communication), persuasive (e.g. peer feedback on workplace actions to increase acceptance of safe working methods), facilitative (e.g. subsidies) or multifaceted (a combination of two or more approaches) intervention strategies.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-18 12:19:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To reduce workers' injuries, different stakeholders in the construction industry (employers, workers, regulatory authorities, suppliers, manufacturers, owners) should implement and adopt safe working methods, workplaces, materials and equipment. Eventually, construction workers and their management should understand safety risks and measures, be motivated to reduce the safety risks, have the skills to adopt safe working methods, and actually adopt safe working methods and circumstances.</P><P>Informational and educational interventions might reduce injuries by fostering new knowledge and skills about safer working methods. Compulsory and persuasive interventions might reduce injuries by changing attitudes of workers and management to use safer working methods and implement safe working circumstances.

Very low-quality evidence also showed that a regional safety campaign, training, inspections and the introduction of occupational health services may or may not reduce non-fatal injuries in construction work. For a multifaceted safety campaign at company level, a multifaceted drug-free workplace programme and a facilitative subsidy policy for safe scaffoldings, we found very low-quality evidence that these interventions may reduce non-fatal injuries in the construction industry.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-30 09:55:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>Systematic searching in multiple databases makes it very likely that we located most published studies.</P><P>Due to the scarce description of most of the interventions and their implementation, it was not possible to characterise all interventions precisely or to draw firm conclusions about their potential effectiveness.</P><P>No information was available on how and to what extent the regulatory interventions were implemented at worksites. Likewise, studies did not provide information about the extent to which employers and workers were motivated to adhere to the regulation. It could be argued that obligatory regulatory interventions are just organisational interventions to commit or compel employers and workers to reduce the risks of injury. <LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 2003</LINK>, for example, stated in their Discussion section that informational and educational programmes could accompany regulation. Health and work ability studies also argue that legislation or regulation alone may not be powerful enough to change attitudes and behaviour in the desired direction (<LINK REF="REF-Ilmarinen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilmarinen 2006</LINK>). Our analyses revealed that introducing regulation may lead to no significant decrease in fatal or non-fatal injuries. This can be explained by variation in implementation of preventive measures. Other authors have reported that stakeholders start preparing for compliance even before the new regulation is effective (<LINK REF="REF-LaMontagne-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaMontagne 2004</LINK>). This would mean that the actual interruption of the time-series does not take place at the moment the regulation is introduced. However, since we have no data about adherence to regulations in the construction industry, this hypothesis must remain speculative.</P><P>The studies of the multifaceted safety campaign on company level, <LINK REF="STD-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spangenberg 2002</LINK>, and the drug-free workplace programme, <LINK REF="STD-Wickizer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wickizer 2004</LINK>, described the content of their interventions in detail. <LINK REF="STD-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spangenberg 2002</LINK> also provided information about the familiarity and perception of the safety campaign, but authors provided no information with respect to implemented activities or performance indicators of the proposed behaviour (for example, good housekeeping). However, the use of drug testing in the workplace is associated with several ethical and legal controversies. Both multifaceted intervention studies used multiple and continuing activities targeted to the whole work organisation (that is, workers, staff and employers), implemented through various strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spangenberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wickizer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wickizer 2004</LINK>). Informational and facilitative strategies that influence the safety culture at worksites, combined with persuasive or compulsory interventions such as worksite inspection or mandatory drug testing, were components of these multifaceted interventions. Other studies (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Neal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 2000</LINK>) have confirmed an association between safety climate and individual safety behaviour. In case of any drug-testing interventions, there is still the discrepancy between an employer's right to test its organisation's (new) workers versus the existing workers' right for privacy and protection against unreasonable drug testing (<LINK REF="STD-Altayeb-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Altayeb 1992</LINK>).</P><P>A facilitative subsidy policy was successful in terms of decreasing accidents - falls to a lower level - for higher risk companies (<LINK REF="STD-Rubio_x002d_Romero-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rubio-Romero 2015</LINK>). Since <LINK REF="REF-Robson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 2001</LINK> argued that different pre-intervention values make it possible for the hypothesis about rate ratios to be true but rate differences to be false, we presented both risk estimates at baseline and follow-up for <LINK REF="STD-Rubio_x002d_Romero-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rubio-Romero 2015</LINK>. For the two multifaceted intervention studies (<LINK REF="STD-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spangenberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wickizer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wickizer 2004</LINK>), we can assume that there was some degree of implementation of the interventions; however, it would have been preferable if the studies had documented this quantitatively as an intermediate measure. Regarding the subsidy policy for safe scaffoldings, we can assume that the interventions were implemented in the intervention companies. For the regulatory studies, we do not know what the implementation level was. It is possible that nobody did anything, or only the 'good' companies took action, where compliance was already high in anticipation. Likewise, the introduction of regulations could have encouraged companies to pay further attention to injuries, resulting in an apparent increase in incidents due to improved reporting.</P><P>Although the authors of two regulation studies from the USA reported significant reductions in injury rates in their original articles (<LINK REF="STD-Derr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Derr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 2003</LINK>), the overall injury rate in the USA construction industry also dropped considerably in that time period (<LINK REF="REF-BLS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BLS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoonakker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoonakker 2005</LINK>). Re-analysis with autoregressive time-series revealed no short-term (level) or long-term (slope) regulatory intervention effects on injuries.</P><P>None of the included studies reported changed behaviour as a secondary outcome measure.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-30 11:30:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>We did not identify any RCTs that assessed interventions for preventing injuries in the construction industry. According to our assessment, the methodological quality of all 17 included studies (14 ITS studies and 3 CBA studies) was low. In other words their risk of bias is high. Safety research in the construction industry is not easy to perform. However, the more recently published studies followed the recommended ITS analysis referred to in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bena-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bena 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choe-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Choe 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farina-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Farina 2013</LINK>).</P><P>Although the quality scores of the re-analysed ITS studies showed moderate scores, most studies suffered from bias due to uncertainty about the independence of the intervention from other changes, and there was high statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, we rated the evidence from ITS studies as being of very low quality. We rated the evidence from the individual CBA studies as being of very low quality due to lack of randomisation, a high risk of bias and imprecision, as particular outcomes were reported only by single studies.</P><P>In total, 17 studies identified from database searching were eligible for inclusion. It was encouraging that more recent studies evaluated interventions recommended by standard texts on safety, safety consultants and safety courses. Examples of such interventions are training courses (<LINK REF="STD-Bena-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bena 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoenfisch-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Schoenfisch 2017</LINK>), inspections (<LINK REF="STD-Miscetti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Miscetti 2008</LINK>), and subsidies (<LINK REF="STD-Rubio_x002d_Romero-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rubio-Romero 2015</LINK>). However, the vast majority of recommended safety interventions such as risk analysis, incident and accident analysis, reporting and resolution of dangerous situations, confrontation and discussion of hazardous behaviour, improvements to work methods, tools and equipment, toolbox meetings, audits, workplace logistics, pre-planning and subcontractor management (coordination and information activities), safer design of buildings and construction, remains to be evaluated. This does not mean that these interventions are not effective, only that there is no proof that they are.</P><P>This Cochrane review shows that the ITS design offers a good opportunity for evaluating rare or stochastic events such as fatal and non-fatal injuries when (randomised) controlled trials are not possible. However, investigators should analyse data from ITS studies appropriately (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>). With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Bena-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bena 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Choe-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Choe 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Farina-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Farina 2013</LINK>, the included ITS studies did not meet the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria for statistical analysis (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2006</LINK>). To minimise bias due to the influence of time trends and autocorrelation among repeated measurements over time, we re-analysed all ITS studies in this Cochrane review according to the EPOC criteria (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>). Because the construction process involves many different tasks, activities, contractors, employers and environmental conditions, with different levels of injury risk exposure, future ITS studies in the construction industry should also take the variability of the construction process into account to increase internal validity, as noted by <LINK REF="STD-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spangenberg 2002</LINK>.</P><P>Ideally, the development of an intervention is based on theory and models that illuminate the pathway of how to prevent work-related injuries. It is necessary to define and measure process indicators designed for evaluating the implementation of the intervention in order to determine the extent to which the proposed intervention has actually been applied. Testing the association of determinants from underlying theories or models with intervention outcomes increases insight into potentially effective elements of the intervention. Measuring workers' behavioural change as a direct effect of the intervention along with injuries provides better insight into how the intervention works and also strengthens the evidence for an effect on the injury outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Robson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Aksorn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aksorn 2008</LINK>, for example, identified four critical factors that affect the implementation of safety programmes in Thai construction projects: worker involvement (for example, creating favourable safety attitudes and motivation), safety prevention and control system (for example, effective enforcement), safety arrangement (for example, information dissemination and adequate resources) and management commitment. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Choe-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Choe 2016</LINK> reported that standardisation of preventive measures protects employees from steel erection hazards in the US iron and steel construction industry.</P><P>Future research in this area should focus on:</P><OL><LI>defining indicators for evaluating the implementation of the intervention;</LI><LI>implementing the interventions in the best possible way;</LI><LI>measuring the behavioural change of workers as a direct result of the intervention process;</LI><LI>measuring fatal and non-fatal injuries as a main outcome variable for evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention; and</LI><LI>testing the association of behavioural changes with the main outcome measures.</LI></OL></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-30 09:55:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>Publication bias due to unpublished negative studies is possible. However, inspection of the excluded lower quality studies revealed that there were also relatively small studies with a reported statistically negative outcome. Therefore, we assumed that the risk of publication bias for the conclusions of this review is low.</P><P>We did not exclude any studies based on language or publication status.</P><P>Although there were differences in the definition of outcome measures, we re-calculated all outcomes so that they were comparable, except for <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2010</LINK>, where we not able to re-calculate the number of injuries per m³ of construction volume to a denominator of workers involved. We assumed that these numbers would be comparable. We do not believe that this has influenced the outcome to a great extent because it equally influences the outcomes before and after the introduction of the intervention and similar trends over time would have resulted. For <LINK REF="STD-Choe-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Choe 2016</LINK>, we obtained fatal and non fatal injury numbers manually from the figure in the article; however, we believe these are accurate numbers.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-26 14:25:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We do not know of any other systematic reviews of effectiveness of interventions in the construction industry. In general, there are only a few systematic reviews of safety interventions. We are aware of <LINK REF="REF-Robson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 2012</LINK>, covering training and education, and <LINK REF="REF-Mullan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullan 2015</LINK>, evaluating behaviour change to prevent injuries. Reviews of the effects of interventions for other major causes of injuries such as falls from heights or trips and slips are lacking.</P><P>After the first version of our review was published, <LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 2008b</LINK> criticised the methods we used in the review both for misinterpreting the outcome of their included regulatory study and for not making better use of qualitative studies. Interpreting ITS studies is not straightforward and is prone to bias. In many studies, authors judge time trends purely based on looking at the data. Therefore we think that a standardised statistical analysis will decrease the risk of bias. In their study, <LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 2003</LINK> specified an effect of regulation three years after implementing the intervention. In our view, this is a data-driven interpretation of the results. Since we do not have arguments to specify the occurrence of the intervention effect, we have chosen not to use other time points for the occurrence of the intervention apart from immediately following the intervention or as an increased downward trend. We believe that we should be careful with attributing the effects of interventions to changes in trends over time. In our opinion, introducing new or changed regulation does not impact on injury rates without sufficient implementation. <LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2009</LINK> has also shown this to be the case for regulation to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-30 09:55:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-30 09:55:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Jani Ruotsalainen"><P>Based on the nine included regulatory studies, there is insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of regulations to reduce fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Nor is there sufficient evidence in the included studies that regionally oriented safety interventions such as campaigning, training, inspections or new occupational health services are effective for reducing non-fatal injuries in construction workers. There is a need for additional strategies to maximise the compliance of employers and workers to the safety measures as prescribed by regulation or advocated through regionally oriented interventions. Multifaceted and continuing interventions, such as a targeted safety campaigns at company level or a drug-free workplace programme, or safety standard and subsidy policy in case of high risk equipment, may be effective for reducing injuries in the longer term. Trying to influence the safety culture and the enforcement of the implementation of safety measures at worksites among management and construction workers is important. However, lack of evidence for safety interventions does not mean that these interventions do not work, but that better evaluation is necessary.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-18 10:11:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In the construction industry, more (preferably randomised) studies are needed to establish the effect of various safety interventions on fatal and non-fatal injuries. Studies with ITS over several years with a high internal validity and a correct statistical analysis are feasible when controlled studies are not possible.

preliminary searches in PubMed to define useful terms for the search strategy. This revealed that searches could be made sensitive but not specific enough to decrease the total amount of references retrieved to a manageable number, which we set at about 10,000. We developed the definitions described below.<BR/><BR/>Search terms for types of participants: working at construction sites.<BR/>The search term construction is truncated as construction* according to the industry name not as construct*, since many other things can be constructed for example, vectors or plasmids in the biochemistry field. We did not use the terms "construction industry" or "construction worker" so as not to make the search too specific.<BR/><BR/>Many articles mentioned the word building instead of the term construction, so we added building* as a search term.<BR/><BR/>There may be articles including neither construction nor building. This is why <LINK REF="REF-Koningsveld-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koningsveld 1997</LINK> used the most important job titles (trades) in their search strategy. In addition, we added the following job titles that appeared many times in the articles found in the preliminary searches: laborer/labourer and contractor.<BR/><BR/>The terms construction, building and job titles like carpenter are also used for other purposes such as a surname or in a company or street name (location), so the search terms concerning the population are followed by a search tag [tiab] (title abstract) or [tw] (text word).<BR/><BR/><B>Search terms for outcome: injury</B><BR/>The primary outcome in the search strategy was defined as an injury, and the term was truncated to injur* to make it sensitive enough.<BR/><BR/>We also considered the terms accident and safety. Accident was truncated as accident* to make it sensitive enough.<BR/><BR/><B>Search terms for interventions</B><BR/>Intervention in the search strategy was defined as any kind of intervention related to safety management, risk management or accident prevention applied to decrease the rate or severity of injuries. Terms resembling these kinds of interventions were selected for this part of the search strategy.<BR/><BR/><B>Search terms for study design</B><BR/>For study design, we used two search strategies to find (cluster) randomised controlled trials and prospective non-randomised controlled trials or interrupted time series; for the Discussion section the last strategy, search #7, was also used to find before-after studies and case-reference studies. For randomised controlled trials, we will use the strategy described by <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>, and for non-randomised studies the strategy described by <LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2005</LINK>.</P><P>We used search terms that covered the concepts of 'construction workers' (participants), 'injury' (primary outcome measure), 'safety' (interventions) and 'study design' to identify studies in the electronic databases.</P><P>We used the following search strategy adapted as appropriate to the specifications of each database:<BR/>#1 construction*[tiab] OR building*[tw] OR builder*[tiab]OR laborer* [tw] OR labourer* [tw] OR contractor* [tw] OR supervisor*[tw] OR "machine driver"[tw] OR "machine drivers"[tw] OR
