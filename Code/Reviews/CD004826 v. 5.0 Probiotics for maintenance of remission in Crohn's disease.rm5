<P>Crohn's disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestines. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Probiotics are living microorganisms that are thought to benefit health by altering the growth and activity of bacteria in the intestines thereby reducing inflammation. Seven small studies of variable quality were reviewed. The studies tested the effect of maintenance treatment with probiotics (e.g. Lactobacilli GG, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, VSL#3, Saccharomyces boulardii) among patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Remission was induced by medical or surgical treatment. The studies lasted for 6 months to a year. The studies did not demonstrate any benefit for probiotic treatment. Probiotics were generally well tolerated and few side effects were reported. Reported side effects include bloating, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and epigastric pain. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of probiotics for the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. It is possible that larger studies might show that this approach to treatment is effective.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by episodes of disease activity and symptom-free remission. Probiotics are microorganisms that can potentially benefit health, and have been evaluated as an alternate means of preventing relapse in patients with CD. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in CD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Trials Register (2005), MEDLINE (1966 - 2005); EMBASE (1980 - 2005); ISI Web of Knowledge (BIDS) 1981 - 2005; On-line clinical trials databases (2005); and review articles. Experts in the field were contacted for unpublished data. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of probiotic therapy. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. The primary outcome was the relative risk (RR) of relapse after maintenance treatment (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven small studies were identified and varied according to probiotics tested, methodological quality and medication regimen. No studies were pooled for statistical analysis.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant benefit of <I>E. coli </I>Nissle for reducing the risk of relapse compared to placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.20), or <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> after surgically-induced remission (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 8.40) or medically-induced remission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant benefit of probiotics for reducing the risk of relapse compared to maintenance therapy employing aminosalicylates or azathioprine (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.30), and in this study the probiotic <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> was associated with adverse events.</P>
<P>In children, there was there was no statistically significant difference between <I>Lactobacillus GG </I>and placebo for reducing the risk of relapse (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.40).<BR/> <BR/>A small study using the yeast <I>Saccharomyces boulardii </I>demonstrated a difference that was not statistically significant in favour of probiotic combined with a reduced level of maintenance therapy over standard maintenance treatment alone (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for the maintenance of remission in CD. All of the included studies enrolled small numbers of patients and may have lacked statistical power to show differences should they exist. Larger trials are required to determine if probiotics are of benefit in Crohn's disease. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-17 13:10:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine of unknown pathogenesis, and involves the interaction of immunological, genetic and environmental factors. The disease is characterized by inflammatory flare-ups, with intervening phases of quiescence or remission, which are symptom-free. </P>
<P>The causes of CD are not clear, but genetic, immunological and microbial factors are all incriminated in disease pathogenesis. The gastrointestinal tract provides residency to high concentrations of diverse species of commensal bacteria that normally maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host. However, it is now widely accepted that intestinal bacteria can induce and sustain inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts with defective immunoregulatory mechanisms. </P>
<P>Resident non-pathogenic bacteria are required for intestinal inflammation to develop in several animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Onderdonk-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onderdonk 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sellon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellon 1998</LINK>), since inflammation fails to develop when rodents are raised in a germ-free environment. Individual commensal species can act as provocateurs of inflammation to varying degrees. In a mouse model, the introduction of non-pathogenic <I>Helicobacter muridarum</I> into the gut accelerated the development of colitis, whereas other non-pathogenic species had no effect (<LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2002</LINK>). In humans, studies suggest that closer intimacy between some commensal species and the intestinal mucosa are associated with the inflammatory process. Higher concentrations of Bacteroides and Enterobacteria (<I>E. coli</I>) are apparent in regions of inflamed mucosa in patients with CD (<LINK REF="REF-Swidsinski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swidsinski 2002</LINK>). Faecal numbers of Enterobacteria are significantly higher in CD patients than in healthy controls (<LINK REF="REF-Seksik-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seksik 2003</LINK>). Further support for the notion that intestinal bacteria are involved in inflammatory processes is gained from animal models where antibiotics reduced the severity of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Bjarnason-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjarnason 1992</LINK>). However, in humans, randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic therapy alone is not effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Borgaonkar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borgaonkar 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Recent observations that some CD patients have mutations in the caspase activating recruitment domain 15/nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2 (CARD15/NOD2) gene involved in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, provide a link between genetic, bacterial and immunological factors in CD (<LINK REF="REF-Ogura-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogura 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1984</LINK>). Enteric bacteria are influential over the structural and functional integrity of the gut, and are important for the development of the gut immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Umesaki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umesaki 2000</LINK>). Intestinal bacteria are present in high concentrations within inflamed mucosa of patients with CD compared to normal regions of bowel where numbers are lower (<LINK REF="REF-Swidsinski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swidsinski 2002</LINK>), and the populations of bacteria within the fecal flora vary in CD patients, containing higher numbers of enterobacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Seksik-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seksik 2003</LINK>). Escherichia coli strains are also suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD (<LINK REF="REF-Masseret-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masseret 2001</LINK>). Some patients with CD have mutations in the CARD15/NOD2 gene, which is involved in the regulation of host response to bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Ogura-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogura 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hugot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugot 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>With the dynamic nature of disease activity, drug treatments are aimed at reducing active disease and maintaining it in remission. These drug treatments include non-steroidal aminosalicylates (although recent evidence indicates that these agents are ineffective); steroids (e.g. prednisolone, budesonide, hydrocortisone, prednisone); immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine and methotrexate); antibiotics (which appear to be ineffective) and novel biological agents (e.g. infliximab). The therapeutic course will vary depending on the severity and stage of disease, and involvement of surgical procedures. Toxicity and adverse events associated with long-term frequent use of many of these drugs continually fuels the search for safer effective alternatives. </P>
<P>
<B>Rationale for using probiotics</B>
<BR/>With bacteria implicated in pathogenesis of CD, probiotics are being evaluated as an alternative and safer means of manipulating the microflora in chronic inflammation. Probiotics are living microbes capable of benefiting host health (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1995</LINK>) and typically include the bacterial species <I>Lactobacilli</I>, <I>Bifidobacteria</I>, Gram-positive cocci and Enterococci, yeast (<I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I>) and fungi (<I>Aspergillus orizae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Fooks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fooks 2002</LINK>). Probiotics are thought to benefit health by altering the growth and/or activity of the intestinal microflora to enhance its competitive action against pathogens, and also through influencing epithelial function and the immune system.</P>
<P>Several beneficial effects of probiotics for the treatment of intestinal inflammation have been demonstrated. <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> produced mixed responses in animal models of colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Dieleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieleman 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shibolet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibolet 2002</LINK>) as did <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> 299V (<LINK REF="REF-Dieleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieleman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2002</LINK>). <I>Lactobacillus reuteri</I> reduced the severity of intestinal inflammation in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Fabia-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabia 1993</LINK>) and mice (<LINK REF="REF-Madsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madsen 1999</LINK>), as did <I>Bifidobacteria infantis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2003</LINK>). Studies investigating combinations of probiotic species incorporated within VSL#3 have demonstrated a partial reduction of colitis after feeding the cocktail of <I>Lactobacilli</I>, <I>Bifidobacteria</I> and <I>Streptococci</I> species (<LINK REF="REF-Madsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madsen 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shibolet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibolet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Probiotics have been used with some limited evidence of success for the treatment of CD (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>), ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rembacken 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venturi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venturi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guslandi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guslandi 2003</LINK>) and pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gionchetti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gionchetti 2003</LINK>). <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> was ineffective in alleviating the recurrence of inflammation after surgery in CD patients (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Rationale for undertaking this review</B>
<BR/>The microflora is implicated in the pathogenesis of CD, and evidence suggests that probiotics may be effective in reducing inflammation in animal models, and may be of benefit in some clinical situations. This review intends to address the following questions:</P>
<P>1) Are probiotics effective for maintenance of remission in CD?<BR/>2) Are single species of probiotics as effective as administering several in combination?<BR/>3) Are probiotics equally effective in treating CD involving the small intestine or the colon?<BR/>4) Are probiotics associated with any adverse events?<BR/>5) Do probiotics offer a drug-sparing effect?</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-17 13:10:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>1 Study selection</B>
<BR/>One author completed the searches and checked all titles and abstracts of relevant studies (VR). Two authors (VR, FB-H) reviewed the full text of relevant studies for their eligibility for inclusion. The authors decided which trials matched the inclusion criteria and recorded their methodological quality, and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or if necessary by discussion with a third author (PF). Where there were missing data from the trial reports attempts were made to obtain that data by contacting the author.</P>
<P>
<B>2 Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors (VR, FB-H), and study authors were contacted to provide clarification when necessary. Quality assessment included an evaluation of the following components for each included study, since there is some evidence that these are associated with biased estimates of treatment effect.</P>
<P>(a) The method of generation of the randomisation sequence;<BR/>(b) The method of allocation concealment - it was considered 'adequate' if the assignment cannot be foreseen;<BR/>(c) Who was blinded/not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors); and<BR/>(d) How many participants were lost to follow-up in each arm and whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention to treat).</P>
<P>
<B>3 Assessment of publication bias</B>
<BR/>The following criteria were examined:<BR/>Authors and institutions involved, journal of publication, funding by manufacturer or other organisation, affiliation of authors with manufacturers.</P>
<P>
<B>4 Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (VR, FB-H) and entered into a pre-derived data extraction form for a consistent approach (See addtional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, data extraction form). Data were checked and entered into a final spreadsheet by one reviewer (VR), and discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (PF). Missing data were obtained from authors. Data recorded included patient demographics, clinical details, type of disease activity index used (e.g. CDAI), study inclusion eligibility, design and quality, intervention type and dose and follow up periods, control type and dose, concurrent medications, outcome measures including relapse rates and adverse events, author's affiliations.</P>
<P>
<B>5 Analysis</B>
<BR/>The relative risk was calculated using a random effects model. The results were expressed as the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The heterogeneity of studies was assessed using the chi-square test, with significance regarded as P &lt; 0.10. Study data relating to secondary outcomes e.g. adverse events were described qualitatively.</P>
<P>Data were not combined for analysis because the studies varied with respect to probiotics tested, methodological quality and medication regimen. A total of 5 analyses were carried out:<BR/>Analysis 01 probiotic versus placebo<BR/>Analysis 02 probiotic versus maintenance treatment<BR/>Analysis 03 probiotic plus maintenance treatment versus maintenance treatment alone<BR/>Analysis 04 probiotics plus maintenance treatment versus placebo plus maintenance treatment (in children)<BR/>Analysis 05 probiotic (yeast) plus maintenance treatment versus maintenance treatment alone</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search strategy revealed 20 possibly relevant studies on the use of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Thirteen studies were excluded largely on the basis of being derivations of original publications (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzello 2000</LINK>). One study was a non-randomised open-label study (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2000</LINK>), which was duplicated (<LINK REF="STD-Guandalini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guandalini 2002</LINK>). Details of the 6 other excluded studies can be found in the characteristics of excluded studies table.</P>
<P>Seven studies were identified which satisfied the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 5 were fully published papers (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>) and 2 were abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK>). All seven studies were randomised trials, which compared a probiotic (or combination of probiotics) to a placebo or directly with maintenance therapy (see characteristics of included studies table). The participants of six of the included studies were adults (age &gt;18 years) and one study enrolled children (age 5 to 21 years). The total number of participants in all the studies was 160. Most of the studies used bacteria as a probiotic, either a single species or a combination product. One study used yeast (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 28 patients with colonic Crohn's disease were recruited from one centre in Germany. All participants had active disease at the time of entry to trial, and part of the trial looked at the effects of probiotics on maintenance of remission once symptoms had improved following a steroid-tapering regimen. Patients were assessed 11 times over one year, and the CDAI calculated, with remission defined as CDAI &lt; 150. All patients received prednisolone (60 mg/day), which was tapered to 5 mg/day for one month prior to complete discontinuation. Patients were randomised to receive <I>Escherichia coli</I> (<I>E. coli</I>) strain Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor), with a 24 day run-in phase increasing the dose from 4 mg Mutaflor to a daily dose of 200 mg daily (5 x 1010 viable bacteria), or a placebo, for one year. Primary outcomes were the duration of inflammation before onset of remission, the proportion of patients reaching remission, and the proportion of patients relapsing whilst on probiotic or placebo.</P>

<BR/>In this study, 21 adult patients (aged 23 to 49 years) with established CD in remission were recruited from a single centre in Italy. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of CD within the previous year and the absence of immunosuppressant or steroid therapy for 3 months prior to entry. Patients had to be in remission for at least 3 months prior to entry. Remission was defined as CDAI &lt; 150. Patients were randomised to receive mesalazine (Pentasa, 3 g/day) or reduced mesalazine (Pentasa 2 g/day) plus the yeast <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> (1 g/day).

<P>Study authors were contacted to provide additional clarification of the methodological quality of their trials.</P>
<P>(a) The method of generation of the randomisation sequence<BR/>In all studies, patients were allocated to treatment, placebo, or active comparator in a randomised fashion. Randomisation was computer generated in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>). Using the Cochrane criteria for randomisation four studies were graded as A (adequate), with the remaining studies graded as B (unclear; See additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, methodological quality components).</P>
<P>(b) The method of allocation concealment<BR/>The allocation of medication was concealed in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>) although the methods of concealment were not always clear.</P>
<P>(c) Blinding (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors)<BR/>Four studies were described as double-blind with placebo although it was not always clear who was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>). In other studies the physician/investigator was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>), and in one study blinding was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>(d) Participants lost to follow-up<BR/>In six studies, all the patients that were randomised for entry into the trials were included in the final analysis. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>), 5 patients randomised to the probiotic group and 3 in the placebo group were non-evaluable at the end of the trial; 5 due to protocol violations and 3 dropped out due to complications after surgery.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>1) PRIMARY OUTCOME</B>
<BR/>Seven studies were identified as eligible for inclusion. Sub-groups were formed depending on studies that defined the primary outcome using a disease activity index (CDAI or PCDAI) and those studies that defined relapse endoscopically. Due to the low numbers of participants in these sub-groups there were insufficient data to allow further analysis according to disease location and type of probiotic used. The main treatment outcome in all of the studies was the number of patients who relapsed at the end of the study period as defined by disease activity indices or endoscopic scores. The secondary outcomes included adverse events relating to probiotics, steroid-sparing effects or impact on levels of serum acute phase proteins, and are all described qualitatively.</P>
<P>
<B>Probiotic versus placebo</B>
<BR/>a) Outcome defined by CDAI<BR/>Three studies compared patients receiving probiotic to a placebo, with no patients receiving concurrent maintenance therapies.<BR/>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of relapses in patients receiving <I>E. coli</I> Nissle compared to the placebo (P = 0.11; <LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>), or patients with surgically-induced remission receiving L. GG compared to placebo (P = 0.59; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>), or patients with remission induced medically receiving L. GG (P = 0.77; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A sub-group analysis of two studies where remission was induced medically (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>) demonstrates that probiotics did not significantly alter the numbers of patients relapsing compared to placebo (P = 0.16). In patients with remission induced surgically (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>), there was no significant difference in relapse rates in patients receiving probiotic compared to placebo (P = 0.59).</P>
<P>b) Outcome defined endoscopically<BR/>One study defining the primary outcome endoscopically (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>) reported no significant advantage for probiotic compared to placebo, with a relative risk of 1.58 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.55).</P>
<P>
<B>Probiotic versus maintenance treatment<BR/>
</B>a) Outcome defined by CDAI<BR/>One study investigated whether the probiotic <I>L. GG</I> was as effective as mesalazine for maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK>). In this small study, after one year of treatment there was no statistically significant difference between the probiotic and mesalazine. The relative risk was 0.67 (95% CI 0.13 to 3.30).</P>
<P>b) Outcome defined endoscopically<BR/>In another small study (<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK>), the probiotic cocktail VSL#3 was compared to mesalasmine. At the end of treatment there was no statistically significant difference between the probiotic and mesalamine (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.40).</P>
<P>
<B>Probiotic plus maintenance therapy versus maintenance treatment alone</B>
<BR/>The small study by <LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK> defined primary outcome using CDAI and compared patients receiving <I>L. GG</I> plus maintenance therapy (i.e. mesalazine) to those receiving the same level of maintenance therapy alone. The use of probiotics produced no significant change in the numbers of patients who relapsed at the end of the study period, with a relative risk of 0.73 (95% CI 0.15 to 3.57).</P>
<P>
<B>Study in children</B> <BR/>Seventy-five children with Crohn's disease in remission (<LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>) receiving <I>L. GG</I> plus maintenance therapy (i.e. aminosalicylates, 6-MP, azathioprine, corticosteroids) were compared to placebo plus maintenance therapy. There was no difference between <I>L. GG </I>therapy and placebo (P = 0.17), with 12/39 (31%) of patients receiving <I>L. GG</I> relapsing compared to 6/36 (17%) of placebo patients at the end of the study period, with a relative risk was 1.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 4.40).</P>
<P>
<B>Study using yeast<BR/>
</B>One small study comprised of 32 patients reported treatment outcomes for <I>Saccharomyces boulardii </I>(1 g/day) plus mesalazine (2 g/day) compared to mesalazine (3 g/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference between the probiotic and control group (P = 0.08), with a relative risk of 0.17 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.23).</P>
<P>
<B>2) SECONDARY OUTCOMES<BR/>
</B>All studies reported the monitoring of adverse events although there was no consistent recording of these outcomes between the studies, so data were not pooled for analysis. In three studies the clinical observations and patient reports indicated that there were no adverse events reported in the probiotic or placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>) reported mild bloating which occurred in both probiotic and placebo groups. No other adverse events were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>). Patients were not withdrawn from the trial which used <I>L. GG</I> (2 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> CFU per day) for 6 months. <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK> reported there were no adverse events relating solely to the use of the probiotic (<I>L. GG</I>). Diarrhoea and bloating occurred in a similar proportion of patients receiving probiotic or placebo. </P>
<P>In two studies adverse events were attributed to the use of probiotic <I>L. GG</I>. Patients receiving 18 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> viable <I>L. GG</I> per day (<LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK>) did experience adverse events resulting in withdrawal from the trial. Two patients receiving <I>L. GG</I> treatment and two patients receiving <I>L. GG</I> plus mesalazine withdrew after experiencing nausea, epigastric pain and constipation. A third group receiving mesalazine alone experienced no adverse events. In children (<LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>), 2 patients receiving <I>L. G</I>G withdrew from the study due to vomiting and intolerance of the medication whilst 1 in the placebo group withdrew due to mild diarrhoea. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown pathogenesis, characterised by flares of inflammatory activity and intervening phases of symptom free remission. Drug treatments aim to reduce active disease and maintain remission, but adverse events are associated with the long-term use of many conventional drugs, fuelling the search for safer alternatives. Bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, and CD may result from a loss of tolerance to normally harmless commensal bacteria. Probiotics are living microorganisms, which upon ingestion in certain numbers may influence health beyond inherent basic nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Guarner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarner 1998</LINK>), and are of interest as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of CD. Probiotics that have been investigated in human clinical trials include the bacterial species <I>Lactobacilli,</I> <I>Bifidobacteria</I>, <I>Streptococci </I>and <I>Escherichia coli</I>, and the yeast <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I>.</P>
<P>Seven clinical trials with adult and child participants were identified. These trials examined the efficacy of probiotics as maintenance therapy for both surgically and medically induced remission in Crohn's disease. The studies had different treatment protocols, probiotics, and definitions of outcome measures, which precluded the pooling of data for meta-analysis. Due to the low numbers of participants, it was not possible to compare the effects of single species versus multiple species cocktails in detail, or to compare the effects of probiotics in patients with different disease locations.</P>
<P>The studies comparing probiotic to a placebo demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the number of patient relapses (<LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>), regardless of whether remission was induced surgically or medically. All these studies had small numbers of patients and may have lacked power to detect a statistically significant difference between probiotics and placebo should such a difference exist. Larger scale investigations of these probiotics may be warranted. </P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK>) compared the use of probiotics which included the cocktail VSL#3 and <I>L. GG</I> respectively to mesalazine and found no difference in relapse rates. <LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK> reported several adverse events attributed to the use of <I>L. GG</I>. In children, there was a non-significant difference favouring placebo over <I>L. GG</I> for reducing the number of relapses (<LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>). Both <I>L. GG</I> and placebo were administered concurrently with maintenance therapy (i.e. aminosalicylates, azathioprine, 6-MP and corticosteroids).</P>
<P>In the small study using <I>Saccharomyces boulardii </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2000a</LINK>), there was a non-significant difference (P = 0.08) in the number of relapses among patients receiving the yeast, despite the statistical analysis in the original publication showing a statistically significant change. This anomaly reflects the small number of participants enrolled in the study which is taken into consideration when calculating the relative risk. A second study with a larger number of participants may be of interest.</P>
<P>Few adverse events were attributed to the use of probiotics with the exception of two studies using <I>L. GG</I>. <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK> reported vomiting in two patients. <LINK REF="STD-Zocco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zocco 2003</LINK> reported epigastric pain, nausea and constipation. In the other five studies, no adverse events were attributed to the use of probiotics. A more consistent approach to monitoring adverse events is needed in order to draw firm conclusions regarding the incidence and nature of these events.</P>
<P>Many of these studies enrolled small numbers of patients which limits statistical power. The need for larger scale multi-centre clinical trials has been recognised and trials are currently underway in Canada and the UK. The assessment of disease activity varied among the studies, with some studies using disease activity indices and others endoscopic scores.</P>
<P>The studies employed a variety of doses, combinations and type of probiotic microorganism. Four studies used <I>L. GG</I> in doses of 12 to 20 billion "colony forming units" or "live bacteria" per day. <LINK REF="STD-Campieri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 2000</LINK> used VSL#3, a combination of 8 probiotic microorganisms providing a dose of 300 billion bacteria per day. <LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1997</LINK> used <I>E. coli </I>strain Nissle 1917 although no numbers of CFU or bacteria per day were reported. It would be of interest to compare the effects of different doses, combinations and species of probiotic more rigorously, but this was not feasible with such a small number of heterogeneous studies. </P>
<P>The use of probiotics in treatment preparations needs to be more carefully monitored. There are concerns over the level of quality control to determine the viability of bacteria in preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton_x002d_Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton-Miller 1999</LINK>) and the level to which a preparation may exert a physiological effect is seldom determined. As the patient's dietary intake could dramatically influence probiotic activity, with large numbers of pre- and pro-biotic products available to consumers, it is likely that a patient may be influencing any treatment effect. It would be useful to report dietary information with clinical trial data. Other factors that may influence the efficacy of probiotic treatments include:</P>
<P>1) Whether participants had received antibiotics prior to trial;</P>
<P>2) The region of intestine involved, i.e. small or large bowel;</P>
<P>3) The levels of colonisation or activity of probiotic strains in patients prior to the start of study; and</P>
<P>4) Patients with medically induced remission may be different than those with surgically induced remission, particularly where the large intestine has been removed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence that probiotic preparations are superior to placebo or aminosalicylates for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease . It should be noted that aminosalicylates are probably not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2005</LINK>). The use of probiotics as maintenance therapy for medically or surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease cannot be recommended at this time. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Some probiotic agents may warrant further study. The limitations of small-scale studies should be taken into account, and larger scale studies are currently underway in Europe and the US. Better designed studies of probiotic treatment (dosage, duration and species) are required to determine the role of probiotics in CD treatment. Future trials should ensure consistent reporting of safety results, the dosage of probiotic(s) administered and levels of prebiotics and probiotics in the diet of the patient. Studies should evaluate the viability of live probiotic preparations, and gain an understanding of the levels already within the gastrointestinal tract prior to the start of the trial.</P>
