<P>Not enough evidence on non-surgical interventions for treating problematic piles (haemorrhoids) during pregnancy and in the early weeks after birth (puerperium).</P>
<P>Piles (haemorrhoids) are swollen veins in the back passage (anus). They normally help empty the back passage and prevent involuntary losses. If swollen in pregnancy, they can cause pain, itching, burning sensation and occasionally bleeding. These problems usually resolve after the baby is born. The incidence is low in countries where the diet is mainly fibre-based. Non-surgical treatments during pregnancy include increasing fibre in the diet and drugs to improve circulation or relieve pain. The review of two trials, involving 150 women, found no studies on dietary modifications, but information on some drugs that looked promising but had insufficient data. More research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-05-05 12:35:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Haemorrhoids (piles) are swollen veins at or near the anus, normally asymptomatic. They do not constitute a disease, unless they become symptomatic. Pregnancy and the puerperium predispose to symptomatic haemorrhoids, being the most common ano-rectal disease at these stages. Symptoms are usually mild and transient and include intermittent bleeding from the anus and pain. Depending on the degree of pain, quality of life could be affected, varying from mild discomfort to real difficulty in dealing with the activities of everyday life. Treatment during pregnancy is mainly directed to the relief of symptoms, especially pain control. The so-called conservative management includes dietary modifications, stimulants or depressants of the bowel transit, local treatment, and phlebotonics (drugs that cause decreased capillary fragility, improving the microcirculation in venous insufficiency). For many women, symptoms will resolve spontaneously soon after birth, and so any corrective treatment is usually deferred to some time after birth. Thus, the objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative management of piles during pregnancy and the puerperium.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-05 12:35:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From 10 potentially eligible studies, two were included in this review (150 women). Both compared oral rutosides against placebo. Rutosides seem to be effective in reducing the signs identified by the healthcare provider, and symptoms and signs reported by women, of haemorrhoidal disease. For the outcome no response to treatment: risk ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.20. Regarding perinatal outcomes, one fetal death and one congenital malformation (possible not related to exposure) were reported in the control and treatment group respectively.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although the treatment with oral hydroxyethylrutosides looks promising for symptom relief in first and second degree haemorrhoids, its use cannot be recommended until new evidence reassures women and their clinicians about their safety. The most commonly used approaches, such as dietary modifications and local treatments, were not properly evaluated during pregnancy and the puerperium.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Anatomy and physiology</HEADING>
<P>Haemorrhoids (piles) are swollen veins at or near the anus (<LINK REF="REF-Amarillo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amarillo 1999</LINK>). The haemorrhoidal veins are normal anatomic structures that can be seen in the human embryo from the eighth week of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1992</LINK>) and, along with the complex neuromuscular system of the anus (sphincters, nerves, mucosae and skin), contribute to the process of faecal continence (<LINK REF="REF-Loder-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loder 1994</LINK>). At rest they are full of blood acting as a plug absorbing variations in abdominal pressure, for example during coughing. This avoids the involuntary loss of faeces or gas without the need to contract the anal sphincter. During evacuation of the bowel, normal haemorrhoids are compressed and drained, facilitating the emptying of the back passage (rectum). If working normally they are asymptomatic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Haemorrhoidal disease</HEADING>
<P>Haemorrhoids can become symptomatic and, therefore, a problem if there is damage to their structure or an alteration in their normal function, or both. This may involve prolapse (the forward or downward displacement of a part of the rectal mucosae through the anus) or other complications such as thrombosis (blood clots in the haemorrhoidal blood vessels) or fissures (a break or slit in the anus) (<LINK REF="REF-Hass-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hass 1983</LINK>). According to the degree of the prolapse and the presence of symptoms, haemorrhoids are classified into four degrees, from first degree (those presenting symptoms but without prolapse) to fourth degree (those abnormally and permanently prolapsed through the anus). Symptoms include a burning sensation, itching, intermittent bleeding of the anus, varying degrees of leakage of mucus, faeces or flatus, perianal hygienic problems, discomfort or pain, or both. The most common symptoms during pregnancy and the puerperium are pain and intermittent bleeding from the anus. Although alarming for the woman, this bleeding is not usually severe and ceases spontaneously. Pain is also often a concern for a young and previously healthy woman. Depending on the degree of pain, quality of life could be affected, varying from mild discomfort to real difficulty in dealing with the activities of everyday life, such as walking, sitting down, emptying bowels, sleeping, caring for the family or a new baby.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Magnitude of the problem</HEADING>
<P>The first historical references to haemorrhoidal disease are from Mesopotamian times, more than 4000 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Parks-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 1955</LINK>). There is controversy about its real prevalence in modern times. Johanson and Sonnenberg found that 4.4% of the general population in USA had symptomatic haemorrhoids, one-third of them needing medical consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1990</LINK>). Other authors found a low prevalence of the condition in Africa where people have mainly fibre-based diets (<LINK REF="REF-Burkitt-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkitt 1975</LINK>) in contrast to industrialised countries where rates of up to 50% to 60% in middle aged people were found (<LINK REF="REF-Hiams-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiams 1970</LINK>). Frequency also increases with age, being higher in women after the age of 60, especially if they have had one or more births (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00f6_hler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Böhler 1994</LINK>). Seventy per cent of women consulting for haemorrhoids have had one or more pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Habr_x002d_Gama-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habr-Gama 1994</LINK>). During pregnancy there are no precise data on the prevalence of symptomatic haemorrhoids but it is well known that it is higher than in non-pregnant women of the same age (<LINK REF="REF-Medich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medich 1995</LINK>). Even though in the majority of the cases it is mild and transient, haemorrhoids are the most frequent ano-rectal disease of pregnancy and the puerperium.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>At present, the aetiology is not well known but predisposing factors for this condition are well recognised. A history of constipation due to poor diet, such as a low fibre diets with low fluid, or bowel disease associated with an increase in intra-abdominal pressure or diarrhoea, are known to be linked to symptomatic haemorrhoids. Determinant factors could be summarised as: hereditary (<LINK REF="REF-Leicester-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leicester 1985</LINK>), bowel transit disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Calhoun-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calhoun 1992</LINK>) and female genital cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Saint_x002d_Pierre-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint-Pierre 1982</LINK>). Supporting the latter, studies suggested that hormones such as follicle stimulant hormone, prolactin and steroids could be responsible for some of the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Saint_x002d_Pierre-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint-Pierre 1982</LINK>). Premenstruum, pregnancy, labour and delivery, and puerperium have a strong influence on this condition. Sphincteral muscles and pelvic floor structures could be modified in tone and position during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium leading to an alteration of the normal functioning in the haemorrhoidal cushion, predisposing to symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schottler-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schottler 1973</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management</HEADING>
<P>The need for treatment is influenced by the severity of the symptoms. Management can be broadly classified as (i) conservative, (ii) alternative, and (iii) surgical.<BR/>(i) Conservative treatment is based on (a) dietary modifications (high fibre intake, high liquid intake, stool softeners), (b) stimulants or depressants of the bowel transit (depending if the woman has constipation or diarrhoea), (c) local treatments (sitz baths, creams, ointments or suppositories containing anaesthetics, anti-inflammatories, and steroids, alone or in combination), and (d) drugs of the family of the flavonoids such as rutosides (that theoretically cause decreased capillary fragility, improving the microcirculation in venous insufficiency).<BR/>(ii) Alternative treatment includes a number of ambulatory interventions that usually do not need anaesthetics, such as injection sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, cryotherapy, infrared photocoagulation, and laser therapy. These methods, for non-pregnant people, are covered by another Cochrane protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Thaha-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaha 2002</LINK>) and will not be described further here.<BR/>(iii) Surgical treatment includes excision surgery, internal sphincterotomy and stapled anopexy. These methods are usually a third line therapy after other treatments have failed, generally they need admission to hospital and anaesthesia. Details are described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Thaha-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaha 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment during pregnancy is mainly directed to the relief of symptoms, especially pain control. For many women, symptoms will resolve spontaneously soon after birth, and so any corrective treatment is usually deferred to some time after birth. Thus, the aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative management of piles during pregnancy and the puerperium.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The review includes women with symptomatic haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium defined, whenever possible, as those with documented signs or symptoms of the condition. We planned to include studies in which participants are described as having 'haemorrhoids' but the localisation or the classification of the severity of disease is not clearly specified. However, no such trials were identified. Women were included regardless of whether the pregnancy was singleton or multiple.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies were included if they evaluated conservative antihaemorrhoidal treatment, such as dietary modifications, stimulant/depressant of the bowel transit, local treatments, drugs that improve the microcirculation in venous insufficiency. Conservative antihaemorrhoidal treatment(s) were compared either with placebo, or no treatment, or with another conservative antihaemorrhoidal treatment. Conservative antihaemorrhoidal treatment include high fibre diets, high liquid intake, stool softeners, depressants of the bowel transit, stimulants of the bowel transit, sitz baths (with cold water, with warm water), creams, ointments or suppositories containing anaesthetics, anti-inflammatories, steroids, alone or in combination, and drugs that theoretically improve the microcirculation in venous insufficiency (rutosides).</P>

<P>Both review authors independently performed a methodological assessment for deciding which studies to include/exclude from the review and extracted data. We were not blinded to the authors, sources of the articles, or results. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We assessed trials for methodological quality using the standard Cochrane criteria of adequacy of allocation concealment: (A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively-numbered, sealed opaque envelopes; (B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation; (C) inadequate concealment of allocation such as open random-number tables, hospital record number. Only properly randomised trials were included, so quasi-random designs were excluded. Information on blinding of outcome assessment, losses to follow up and postrandomisation exclusions were collected systematically for each trial.</P>
<P>Quality scores for completeness of follow up and blinding of the assessment of outcome were assigned to each reported outcome using the following criteria: for withdrawals, studies were classified as follows: (a) less than 3% of participants withdrawn; (b) from 3% to 9.9% of participants withdrawn; (c) from 10% to 19.9% of participants withdrawn. We excluded trials if it was not possible to enter data on an intention-to-treat basis or 20% or more participants were excluded, or both.<BR/>
<BR/>For blinding of assessment of outcomes: (a) double blind, neither investigator nor participants knew or were likely to guess the allocated group; (b) single blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation; or the trial is described as double blind, but side-effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (greater than 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified, or the method for blinding is not described; (c) no blinding, both investigator and participants knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment or, blinding not mentioned.</P>
<P>We designed an ad-hoc form, both to facilitate the process of data extraction and to request additional (unpublished) information from the authors of the original reports.</P>

We assessed statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic.</P>
<P>After the protocol was first published, we added one category of conservative treatment: drugs of the family of the flavonoids such as rutosides (that theoretically cause decreased capillary fragility, improving the microcirculation in venous insufficiency). As these treatments are given for long periods during pregnancy (including the first trimester period), new outcomes were considered: those related to maternal pathologies (such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, abruptio, etc), and those related to the baby (such as perinatal death, congenital malformations, preterm delivery, small-for-gestational-age babies, admission to intensive care baby unit).</P>

<P>In total, 10 trials were considered; eight have been excluded and two included examining a total of 150 women.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Five trials evaluating conservative treatment for haemorrhoids during pregnancy clearly were not randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belgium-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Belgium 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bulgaria-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bulgaria 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-India-1997" TYPE="STUDY">India 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Italy-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Italy 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Italy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Italy 1992</LINK>), and one used a quasi-random design (<LINK REF="STD-Italy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Italy 1971</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Australia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Australia 1993</LINK>) randomised 129 puerperal women to a cooling device being the difference between treatment and control arm the difference of the device temperature (-20 versus 4 centigrades). The study by Ledward et al evaluated an ointment topically administered in puerperal women (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1980" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1980</LINK>). However, this trial, although randomised and placebo controlled, excluded 32% of the recruited women from the final analysis so it was excluded. The women were withdrawn from analysis after randomisation.</P>

<P>The following text summarises the key characteristics of the two trials included in the review. For a detailed description <I>see</I> table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Only two met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Indonesia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Indonesia 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thailand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thailand 2001</LINK>). Both have compared oral hydroxyethilrutosides, a drug given to improve the microcirculation in venous insufficiency, with placebo. The two included studies were small, totalling 150 women for the analysis of the main outcomes (97 women in <LINK REF="STD-Indonesia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Indonesia 1992</LINK>, and 53 women in <LINK REF="STD-Thailand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thailand 2001</LINK>). Both trials enrolled women during pregnancy and classified them as having first- to fourth-degree haemorrhoids, according to the severity of signs and symptoms (first degree when haemorrhoids bleed but do not protrude through the anus, second degree when haemorrhoids protrude on defecation but are reduced spontaneously, third degree when haemorrhoids protrude on defecation but need to be replaced digitally and fourth degree when haemorrhoids are continuously protruding). They evaluated the intervention in women with mild-moderate disease (at least two of the following signs: bleeding, inflammation and vein dilatation). Women with fourth-degree haemorrhoids were not eligible to enter in the trials, and in <LINK REF="STD-Thailand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thailand 2001</LINK>, women suffering from a third degree disease were also excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Both trials evaluated hydroxyethylrutosides, a flavonoid given to improve the microcirculation (passage of blood in the smallest vessels), mainly due to its effect on reduction of the microvascular permeability (the property of being permeable) and oedema (an accumulation of an excessive amount of watery fluid in the tissues) in participants with chronic venous insufficiency (venous incompetence). The drug was given orally in doses of 500 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Indonesia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Indonesia 1992</LINK>) and 600 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Thailand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thailand 2001</LINK>) over a two-week period. If necessary, the two-week course was repeated. Women (and their fetuses), were exposed to the drug after 20 weeks' gestation in the Indonesian study (from 22 to 33 weeks), and at a mean of 20 weeks in the Thai trial (ranging from 14 to 26 weeks' gestation). In the Indonesian study, information was collected about the defecation habits of the recruited women; 95% of them using the "traditional" squatting position, and the rest the "Western style" seating position.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For the woman</HEADING>
<P>Both trials reported on the no response to treatment outcome, which they defined as "objective" (clinical staff evaluation of the signs) and "subjective" (women's self-assessment of symptoms) improvement and assessed at two and four weeks. As defined in our protocol, we have only included the results from the latter assessment. Both trials also included data on side-effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For the baby</HEADING>
<P>Both trials reported on death and congenital malformation, the <LINK REF="STD-Indonesia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Indonesia 1992</LINK> trial also reported on preterm delivery.</P>
<P>The trials did not evaluate any of the other prespecified outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In general, methodological quality was poor. Both trials were scored as 'B' when considered attempts to conceal the allocation sequence. Although they reported the use of placebo, it was not described enough (neither in its characteristics nor in the preparation of the treatment sequence) to assure the unpredictability of the following assignment. The same criteria apply for assessment of outcomes. Random generation was not described, as well as the sample sizes and power calculations. Although authors did look at the safety of the drug and possible effects on the baby, the trials were too small to demonstrate any difference in any of these outcomes. The study from Indonesia withdrew three women (3%) from analysis, while seven women (12%) were excluded from the study conducted in Thailand. Informed consent was mentioned in both trials.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-05 12:46:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Haemorrhoids are a common medical condition and the most frequent ano-rectal disease of pregnancy and the puerperium. Although symptoms are often mild and transient, haemorrhoids can lead to intermittent bleeding from the anus or pain, which can be alarming for the woman. Pain may be more severe if there is local thrombosis, interfering with the activities of everyday life, and may be an additional concern if present around the time of birth.</P>
<P>Constipation is more common during pregnancy, and a predisposing factor for haemorrhoids. Increased amount of fibre and water intake in the diet, or the addition of fibre supplements are advocated to resolve constipation and, indirectly, improve the signs and symptoms of haemorrhoids. This review demonstrated that none of these interventions have been evaluated in randomised controlled trials during pregnancy, however. Fibre shows a consistent beneficial effect for overall symptoms as well as bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic haemorrhoids. Prolapse involves a structural change that is unlikely to improve with a change in the consistency of faeces or the frequency of defecation. In other words, damage to the connective tissue that supports the haemorrhoidal cushions resulting from chronic straining is not likely to improve with fibre supplementation alone (<LINK REF="REF-Alonso_x002d_Coello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alonso-Coello 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Local interventions such as sitz baths, ice, or ointments containing anaesthetics, phlebotonics, or glucocorticoids alone or in combination are widely used and frequently prescribed in primary care, especially for the acute thrombotic episodes. Only one randomised controlled trial has evaluated a local ointment containing an association of a heparinoid, steroid, local anaesthetic and a disinfectant in 100 consecutive puerperal women (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1980" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1980</LINK>). However, it was excluded from this review as 32% of women were withdrawn from analysis after randomisation. There is therefore no solid evidence to support the use of any local intervention. For non-pregnant people, these treatments will also be covered by a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Alonso_x002d_Coello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alonso-Coello 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rutosides belong to the family of flavonoids (natural products extracted from plants). These are medications proposed for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. Although their mechanism of action is not well known, the phlebotonic effect (the action of increasing the venous tone) could be related to increasing lymphatic drainage (withdrawal of linfatic fluids), improvement of venous tone, and a reduction of capillary hyper permeability (the passage of substances through the membrane of the smallest vessels). A reduction of rectal mucosal capillary fragility (liability to break) has been also proposed as a possible mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 1969</LINK>). The true benefits and efficacy of these drugs are still not clear and there is concern about their safety. The main adverse effects for the flavonoids are gastrointestinal, and are defined as transient and mild. Outside of pregnancy they are generally used in the less severe stages of haemorrhoids, that is first- and second-grade haemorrhoids, and during the thrombosis episode. The efficacy and safety of rutosides for the treatment of haemorrhoids in the general population will be addressed by another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Alonso-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alonso 2003</LINK>). In the present review, only two trials totalling 150 women evaluated the efficacy of hydroxyethylrutosides during pregnancy. The intervention appears to be effective for symptom relief at four weeks. Although there is no evidence of any harmful effect on the unborn baby, and due to the small sample sizes, there are not enough data to know whether this drug is safe in pregnancy. Only one trial (69 women) evaluating rutosides against placebo was included in this review. The intervention reduced symptom scores for pain, feelings of heaviness or tiredness, or both, nocturnal cramps and paraesthesiae (an abnormal sensation, such as of burning, pricking, tickling, or tingling) compared with placebo in women with visible varicose veins and such symptoms after 28 weeks' gestation. Again, as only 37 women received the active treatment, no conclusions could be made about its safety.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials found that rutosides reduce haemorrhoidal symptoms in pregnant women with first- and second-degree haemorrhoids. However, the safety data are insufficient to rule out clinically important harms. Until reliable evidence on safety is available, exposing pregnant women to these drugs is not advisable. For conservative management of thrombosed haemorrhoids, other treatment options such as local ointments have been proposed; however, no evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding possible benefits and risks is available. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As dietary modifications or local treatments are usually regarded as the first general approach in clinical practice to symptomatic haemorrhoids, more research needs to be undertaken on both interventions to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Further data on safety of rutosides during pregnancy from large, methodologically sound randomised controlled trials are needed. As the treatment is proposed for relatively long periods during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, these studies need to be large enough to evaluate any possible adverse effect on the baby. </P>
