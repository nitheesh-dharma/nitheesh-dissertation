<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of developing blood clots in their veins. These clots may be in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) or travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism (PE)). Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the combined term for DVT and PE. Prevention of these blood clots (prophylaxis) after surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative vein clots. These potential benefits, however, have to be balanced against the associated risks of bleeding. The optimal duration of prophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement, or hip fracture repair remains controversial. It is common practice to administer prophylaxis using drugs such as low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin (anticoagulants) until discharge from hospital and for a minimum of seven to 14 days after surgery. Current international guidelines recommend extending prophylaxis for up to 35 days following major orthopaedic surgery but recognise that the recommendation is weak due to moderate quality evidence. In addition, new oral anticoagulants (direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)) show potential benefits such as taking tablets by mouth instead of injection, lack of frequent monitoring and few known drug interactions. Interest in this topic therefore remains high.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>A total of 16 studies were included, with 24,930 randomised participants (current until May 2015). The main outcomes of interest were symptomatic (showing symptoms) VTE, including DVT and PE, and bleeding (major, clinically relevant non-major and minor bleeding). Six studies compared heparin with placebo, one compared the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin with placebo, two compared DOAC with placebo, one compared VKA with heparin, five compared DOAC with heparin and one study compared using a variety of anticoagulant treatments with placebo. Only three trials included participants undergoing knee replacement and no studies included participants undergoing hip fracture repair.</P>
<P>For the comparison heparin versus placebo (six studies) no differences were found between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE and major bleeding. Minor bleeding was increased in the heparin group. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported.</P>
<P>The comparison VKA versus placebo (one study) and the comparison placebo with anticoagulants chosen at the discretion of the investigators (one study) showed no differences between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE and major bleeding. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported.</P>
<P>For the comparison DOACs versus placebo (two studies), reduced symptomatic VTE and symptomatic DVT were found in favour of the DOAC but no differences were found for symptomatic PE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding.</P>
<P>Comparing extended-duration VKA with extended-duration LMWH (one study) there was no difference between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, major bleeding and minor bleeding. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported.</P>
<P>Comparing extended-duration DOAC with extended-duration LMWH (five studies) there was no difference between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, the included studies were of good methodological quality, with the majority of studies having little risk of bias due to study design and reporting. The majority of concerns came from lack of reporting of specific details. The quality of the evidence was generally moderate, either because only one study was included in a comparison, because of few events or because there were a lot of differences between the findings of the studies meaning that the data were difficult to interpret. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between VTE and extended-duration oral anticoagulants for knee replacement and hip fracture repair as well as outcomes such as DVT below the knee and above the knee, reoperation, wound infection and healing.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 16 studies (24,930 participants); six compared heparin with placebo, one compared VKA with placebo, two compared DOAC with placebo, one compared VKA with heparin, five compared DOAC with heparin and one compared anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion with placebo. Three trials included participants undergoing knee replacement. No studies assessed hip fracture repair.</P>
<P>Trials were generally of good methodological quality. The main reason for unclear risk of bias was insufficient reporting. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was generally moderate, as some comparisons included a single study, low number of events or heterogeneity between studies leading to wide CIs.</P>
<P>We showed no difference between extended-duration heparin and placebo in symptomatic VTE (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.01; 2329 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.38; 2019 participants; 4 studies; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.33; 1595 participants; 3 studies; low quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.46; 2500 participants; 5 studies; moderate quality evidence). Minor bleeding was increased in the heparin group (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.81; 2500 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported.</P>
<P>We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and placebo (one study, 360 participants) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.62; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic PE (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; moderate quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 2.89, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.31; low quality evidence).

<P>Extended-duration DOAC showed reduced symptomatic VTE (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; 2419 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and symptomatic DVT (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; 2459 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) compared to placebo. No differences were found for symptomatic PE (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1733 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.02; 2457 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and minor bleeding (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.88; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>We showed no difference between extended-duration anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion and placebo (one study, 557 participants, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.21), symptomatic PE (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.13), and major bleeding (OR 5.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 105.76). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported.</P>
<P>We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and heparin (one study, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.16; 1279 participants), symptomatic DVT (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.68; 1279 participants), symptomatic PE (OR 9.16, 95% CI 0.49 to 170.42; 1279 participants), major bleeding (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 7.85; 1272 participants) and minor bleeding (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.76; 1279 participants).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 07:21:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests extended-duration anticoagulants to prevent VTE should be considered for people undergoing hip replacement surgery, although the benefit should be weighed against the increased risk of minor bleeding.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:04:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism describes the formation of a clot in the deep veins (deep vein thrombosis or DVT - usually of the lower extremities) and the subsequent embolisation of the clot to the pulmonary circulation (pulmonary embolisation or PE) or both. DVT of the lower limbs is associated with localised pain, swelling and erythema as well as the development of pulmonary emboli (PE), and the more localised and chronic post thrombotic syndrome. PE presents with shortness of breath, pain on inspiration, tachycardia and right heart overload, and if untreated, can lead to circulatory collapse and death.</P>
<P>The incidence of VTE, in mostly white populations, is between 100 and 200 per 100,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>). Of these, it is estimated that 45 to 117 per 100,000 person years are due to DVT (without PE) and 29 to 78 per 100,000 person years are due to PE (with or without DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>). Recurrent VTE occurs in approximately 7.4% of patients by one year, rising to 30.4% of patients by 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Cushman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although DVT and PE can occur spontaneously, there are many risk factors for VTE, including periods of inactivity, dehydration, hospitalisation, trauma, clotting disorders and previous thrombosis, varicose veins with phlebitis, pregnancy, oral combined hormonal contraceptives, malignancy, obesity, smoking and age (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prophylactic strategies in those deemed to be at risk (for example those undergoing surgical procedures or prolonged hospital inpatient stays) are recommended by international guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; 
<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>), The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2012</LINK>) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>) and include the use of anticoagulation such as LMWH, UFH, oral direct factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban), oral direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran), pentasaccharides (fondaparinux), and mechanical compression such as compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:04:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is common practice to administer prophylaxis until discharge from hospital, and for a minimum of seven to 14 days after surgery. However, in patients receiving in-hospital prophylaxis, the prevalence of venographic DVT (a blood clot in the leg detected by venography) is still 15% to 30% at the time of hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nurmohamed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurmohamed 1992</LINK>) while an additional 10% to 25% of patients develop new asymptomatic DVT during the next three to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fragmin-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Fragmin Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-Study" TYPE="STUDY">French Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1998</LINK>). It is estimated, based on the available literature, that fewer than 10% of patients with venographically documented DVT will develop symptomatic VTE.</P>
<P>Extended-duration prophylaxis is prophylaxis which starts at admission and continues well beyond discharge, typically for an additional 21 to 28 days after discharge, leading to a period of prophylaxis of approximately 35 days (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Randomised trials have demonstrated that extending prophylaxis beyond the time of hospital discharge substantially reduces the risk of developing new asymptomatic thrombi at 30 to 45 days (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fragmin-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Fragmin Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-Study" TYPE="STUDY">French Study</LINK>) and this has led these investigators to recommend that prophylaxis of longer duration should be used in all patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR).</P>
<P>However, two prospective studies, conducted in patients without known proximal DVT at the time of discharge from hospital, demonstrated that the incidence of new out-of-hospital symptomatic DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) without extended-duration prophylaxis was only approximately 2% after three months of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1997</LINK>). This data suggest that the majority of asymptomatic thrombi remain clinically silent irrespective of whether extended-duration prophylaxis is given. Meanwhile, the impact of extended-duration prophylaxis on symptomatic VTE remains to be clarified. <LINK REF="STD-Heit-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heit 2000</LINK> showed that a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE could not be demonstrated and therefore concluded that prophylaxis confined to the in-hospital phase is adequate in most patients.</P>

<P>Where appropriate we used all randomised participants for the analysis. However, many of the included studies had many participants excluded after randomisation, creating a large disparity between the number of participants randomised and the number available for assessment of VTE at the end of the study. After discussion between the review authors, we decided it was generally inappropriate to include all randomised participants in our analysis, and would use the 'intention-to-treat' populations as reported by the studies. This population generally consisted of all participants that received treatment and had evaluable testing of VTE at the end of the study. If these values were not available, we utilised the reported per-protocol data. Where necessary, we contacted study authors to provide missing data.</P>

<P>A test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect. For each included meta-analysis we obtained a value comparing the test statistic with a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> distribution.

We included the outcomes symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding in the 'Summary of findings' table. We calculated assumed control intervention risks from the mean number of events in the control groups of the selected studies for each outcome. The system developed by the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE working group) was used for grading the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low and very low, based on within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effects estimates, and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>).

The studies evaluating DOACs versus heparin were only performed in participants undergoing hip replacement, and therefore no subgroup analysis between hip and knee replacement was undertaken. As these studies compared two different anticoagulant treatments and randomised participants prior to surgery, there was no initial phase and objective assessment of VTE after the initial phase. Therefore these subgroup analyses were not possible. We found no difference between the treatment groups for most of the evaluated outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reporting bias, subgroup and sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We did not construct funnel plots for meta analyses because the meta analyses did not include at least 10 studies.</P>
<P>We planned to apply subgroup analysis to examine participants undergoing revisions of a previous hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair, but we unfortunately found this to be impossible because these data were not reported separately. As the duration of the in-hospital/initial phase ranged from four days to 14 days, subgroup analysis for 15 days or more was not required. Results of the other planned subgroup analyses are reported above. We did not consider any studies to be of low quality based on the 'Risk of bias' tool and therefore did not perform the planned sensitivity analysis for this reason.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:05:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:05:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have shown that extended-duration prophylaxis with DOACs in patients undergoing major hip or knee replacement surgery significantly reduces the risk of symptomatic VTE. This benefit is achieved with no excess adverse events or major bleeding but with increased minor bleeding. A significant reduction in PE or mortality could not be shown but the direction of the treatment effect for these outcomes was consistent with that seen for the primary outcome, suggesting that a similar reduction for these outcomes might be expected.</P>
<P>Our findings of a significant treatment benefit of extended-duration prophylaxis for prevention of symptomatic VTE are based on a pooled analysis of both hip and knee replacement trials. However, our meta-analysis cannot draw a fully informed conclusion for participants undergoing knee replacement as far fewer studies evaluated these types of participants separately, as compared with hip replacement.</P>
<P>When comparing extended-duration anticoagulants (DOACs and VKA) versus extended-duration LMWHs there were no differences between the treatments in symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE and showed decreased odds in total VTE for DOACs versus LMWH. There was also no difference in mortality, adverse events or bleeding events. These findings support the use of less invasive oral anticoagulants versus the more invasive LMWHs which often have to be administered by injection into subcutaneous tissue. However, it needs to be kept in mind that several of the meta-analyses were underpowered and showed heterogeneity. We hope with the inclusion of new studies in future updates of this review we will be better able to draw stronger conclusions regarding these treatment comparisons.</P>
<P>One widely recognised impediment to the more widespread use of effective prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement is concern about the risk of bleeding. In this regard, the data from our review are reassuring in that, even with sustained use for up to six weeks, prophylactic-dose anticoagulants is not associated with an excess in major bleeding in all comparisons except for the comparison of VKA versus heparin.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:05:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a total of 16 studies with nearly 25,000 randomised participants. Despite this large number of included studies some comparisons included a single study only, or few events were recorded, which led to wide confidence intervals, and difficulties interpreting the data.</P>
<P>There are other antithrombotic therapies besides the ones evaluated in this review that might be used for prevention of VTE in major orthopaedic surgery or out-of-hospital prophylaxis, for example aspirin, which were not addressed in this review. We plan to include these in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>Although compliance with extended-duration prophylaxis seemed to be 90% or higher in most trials included in our meta-analyses, the definition of compliance varied among the studies and not all studies reported the level of compliance with randomised treatment allocation that was achieved. However, the probable impact of lack of compliance is to reduce the power of a randomised trial to detect a significant treatment benefit. Therefore an even greater benefit of extended-duration prophylaxis might be realised in populations in which higher levels of compliance are achieved.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2014</LINK> reported that surgical site infections and reoperations in the three months following joint replacements may be associated with anticoagulant use and this may be a barrier to extended thromboprophylaxis but our meta-analyses are underpowered to draw conclusions on this issue due to a lack of reporting of wound infections, wound healing and reoperations in the studies included in this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:05:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite examining the totality of the evidence by pooling results from all the available properly randomised trials, the total number of participants randomly assigned and the number of outcome events was modest. Therefore, our meta-analyses potentially lacked statistical power to provide precise estimates of frequency and treatment effect for clinically important outcomes such as PE. However, DVT and PE represent clinical manifestations of the same underlying disease process. Therefore, strategies that are effective for the prevention of DVT, especially those proximally located, are likely also to be effective for the prevention of non-fatal and fatal PE.</P>
<P>There was a lot of variation in the design of studies included in our meta-analyses. However, differences among trials are inevitable since individual trials look at different populations with different treatment protocols, and there is always some heterogeneity, even within individual trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1994</LINK>). Differences in trial design do not necessarily preclude pooling of their results since, in a meta-analysis, individual participants are directly compared only with other participants within the same trial, and not across the trials. The validity of our approach is further supported by the external consistency of our findings with the results of individual trials.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence varied by comparison and was on average moderate. Heterogeneity was found between studies comparing DOAC and heparin, and for some outcomes, such as PE and mortality, few events were recorded during the study periods leading to imprecision. For three comparisons, only one study was identified. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK> for further details.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-11-19 06:56:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Every effort was made to limit potential biases in the review through duplication of study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias by two review authors. Also, we utilised pre-designed data extraction forms and discussed any disagreements and undertook a meticulous and exhaustive search for both published and unpublished studies.</P>
<P>Despite these techniques to reduce bias, there are still areas of concern. One issue was with the total numbers of participants used in the meta-analyses. Most of the included studies had large numbers of participants that were excluded after randomisation. This was due mainly to detecting DVT at discharge from the hospital, non-compliance, adverse events and non-evaluable objective testing of DVT. Due to these large numbers of exclusions it was inappropriate to use all randomised participants, and we therefore attempted to use the most reliable intention-to-treat population as reported by the study authors. This method required us to adapt the numbers used by the study authors, which did vary between studies.</P>
<P>We did not stratify according to the use of mechanical prophylaxis since, in most studies, the use of mechanical prophylaxis was left to the discretion of the local investigator and is usually not reported separately in the final study report. However, this should not lead to any bias because the use of mechanical methods is likely to be balanced between the two groups as a result of proper use of randomisation.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-28 15:05:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recently published meta-analysis evaluated extended duration using new oral anticoagulants versus extended duration using LMWHs (<LINK REF="REF-Liew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2014</LINK>). The four included studies are also included in our review. For symptomatic VTE they found a risk ratio in favour of oral anticoagulants of 0.42 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.86). Although <LINK REF="REF-Liew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2014</LINK> included <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE Trial</LINK> in their review, they did not include this study in the evaluation of symptomatic VTE, which led to the major differences in our findings, as the two dabigatran treatment groups had a large number of VTEs, compared with the LMWH group. <LINK REF="REF-Liew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2014</LINK> also did not include the <LINK REF="STD-SACRE-Study" TYPE="STUDY">SACRE Study</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Liew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2014</LINK> found no difference in mortality or bleeding events, which is similar to our own review.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis published in 2001 compared extended-duration prophylaxis to short duration followed by placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 2001</LINK> included nine studies, five of which were also included in our review and the other four we excluded because we deemed they did not meet the five-week treatment-duration requirement for this review. <LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 2001</LINK>'s findings were similar to ours, with a decreased odds of symptomatic DVT in the extended duration treatment group (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61), no difference in major bleeding but an increase in minor bleeding.</P>

<P>Continued research in this area is needed, specifically as newer, and possibly safer medications become available. Oral anticoagulants could be a promising alternative to LMWHs that require daily injections, but the evidence is currently insufficient. Specifically, further research is required to better understand the association between VTE and extended-duration oral anticoagulants in relation to knee replacement and hip fracture repair as well as outcomes such as distal and proximal DVT, reoperation, wound infection and healing, regarding the optimal duration of extended therapy, possibility of combining therapies and effects of extended therapies on length of hospital stay. An assessment of cost-effectiveness as part of the further research is also warranted.</P>

<P>New authors have taken over this review.</P>
<P>The outcome 'Total VTE' was added as several studies did not report VTE (specifically DVT) as symptomatic or asymptomatic, making it difficult to place within the previously listed outcome definitions. This way more data could be combined for comparison, but needed to be done with caution as the outcomes would be more heterogenous.</P>
<P>'Clinically relevant non-major bleeding' was added to the bleeding outcomes as this was commonly reported in the newer, larger trials, and does not fit well within major or minor bleeding categories.</P>
<P>The outcomes 'Wound infection', 'Wound healing' and 'Reoperation following surgery' were added as they are deemed important outcomes for orthopaedic surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Calculation of number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) were removed as the calculations in a meta-analysis setting can be misleading and should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>The method of evaluating study quality has changed since the protocol was published; we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We have also added 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
<P>In the 'Sensitivity analysis' section, we have removed the indication to compare results using a fixed and random-effects model, as we are using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to decide the appropriateness of the use of the different model types.</P>
