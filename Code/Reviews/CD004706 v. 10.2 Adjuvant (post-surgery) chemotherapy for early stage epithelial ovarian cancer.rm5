<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>The initial treatment of ovarian cancer (OC) is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue. This also serves to stage the disease. Staging surgery in OC is considered optimal (complete) when it includes removal of the womb, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, as well as removal of the fatty apron attached to the gut (omentum), and sampling of the abdominal fluid, pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, the side walls of the pelvis and paracolic gutters, and the diaphragm. OC is also graded 1, 2, or 3 (well-, moderately-, or poorly-differentiated), with well-differentiated (grade 1) OC associated with the best prognosis. After surgery, most women with OC are offered adjuvant (added) chemotherapy with platinum-containing drugs. However, in the past women with stage Ia and Ib have not routinely been offered chemotherapy because the risk of treatment complications may outweigh the survival benefits.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previous version of this Cochrane review, which found that women with early-stage OC who received adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) lived longer than women who did not, and took longer for their disease to recur after initial treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
</P>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of AC versus observation after surgery in women diagnosed with early-stage OC and pooled study outcome data where appropriate.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to 24th March 2015 and included five trials involving 1277 women with early-stage OC in the review, and four good quality trials contributed data. Most women (more than 95%) had stage I OC. For this update, we identified one additional publication of 10-year follow-up results from a trial already included in the review, but found no new trials. We found high quality evidence that women diagnosed with early-stage OC who received AC after surgery to remove and stage the disease had a lower risk of dying within 10 years than women who did not receive AC (observation group), and a lower risk of the cancer returning in the 10 years after treatment (see Cates plot, Figures 4 to 7). Low quality evidence suggested that women with higher risk disease may have more to gain from AC, but we could not exclude a survival benefit for other early stage disease. Chemotherapy can have side effects but we found insufficient data to compare adverse events and long term risks between chemotherapy and observation groups.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>In early stage ovarian cancer, AC improves survival and reduces the risk of ovarian cancer recurring compared with no AC. Therefore AC in early stage disease should be considered in all women. However, it remains uncertain whether women with lower risk early stage disease will benefit much from AC and decisions to use AC should be mindful of this uncertainty, and the uncertainty regarding adverse events.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:39:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the second update of the review first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2009, Issue 1. Epithelial ovarian cancer is diagnosed in over 200,000 women worldwide each year. Ten to 20% of women are diagnosed early, when there is still a good possibility of cure. The treatment of early-stage (stage I and IIa) disease involves surgery to remove the disease, often followed by chemotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy). The largest clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy show an overall survival (OS) advantage with platinum-based chemotherapy; however the precise role and type of this treatment in subgroups of women with differing prognoses needs to be defined.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:15:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To undertake a systematic review of the evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer to determine whether chemotherapy following surgery offers a survival advantage over the policy of observation following surgery (with chemotherapy reserved for treatment of disease recurrence); and to determine if clinical subgroups of women with differing prognoses, based on histological subtype or completeness of surgical staging, have more or less to gain from adjuvant chemotherapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:41:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed an electronic search using the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to March week 5, 2015), and EMBASE (1980 to week 14, 2015). We developed the search strategy using free-text and medical subject headings (MeSH). We also searched registers of clinical trials and citation lists of included studies for potentially relevant studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-03 14:58:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original version of this Cochrane review included five RCTs involving 1277 women. In this 2015 update, no new studies met the inclusion criteria but we included an additional paper with mature data (10-year follow-up) relating to a previously included study (ICON1).</P>
<P>We included four studies in the meta-analyses and considered them to be at a low risk of bias. Most study participants (&gt; 95%) had stage I ovarian cancer. Meta-analysis of five-year data from three studies indicated that women who received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy had better overall survival (OS) than those who did not (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.93; 1008 women; 3 studies; I² statistic = 0%; <I>high quality evidence</I>). Likewise, meta-analysis of five-year data from four studies indicated that women who received adjuvant chemotherapy had better progression-free survival (PFS) than those who did not (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84; 1170 women, 4 studies; I² statistic = 0%; <I>high quality evidence</I>). These findings were robust over time, with 10-year HR estimates of 0.72 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 925 women, 2 studies) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.83; 925 women, 2 studies) for OS and PFS, respectively (<I>high quality evidence)</I>. The risk of death at 10 years follow-up favoured the adjuvant chemotherapy arm (0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; 923 women, 2 studies; I² statistic = 0%), as did the findings for risk of progression at 10 years (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 925 women, 2 studies; I² statistic = 0%). Low quality evidence suggested that women with high-risk disease may have the most to gain from adjuvant chemotherapy. However, subgroup analyses could neither confirm nor exclude survival benefits in lower risk disease or in optimally staged disease. We found insufficient data to compare adverse events and long term risks between chemotherapy and observation groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:44:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality evidence indicates that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is effective in prolonging survival in women with early stage (FIGO stage I/IIa) epithelial ovarian cancer. It remains uncertain whether women with low- and intermediate-risk early stage disease will benefit as much from adjuvant chemotherapy as women with high-risk disease. Decisions to use adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in these women should be mindful of this uncertainty, and the uncertainty regarding adverse events. Treatment of women with lower risk disease should be individualised to take into account individual factors.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the Cochrane review first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2009</LINK>) and updated in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2012</LINK>). Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women up to 64 years of age. Worldwide there are more than 200,000 new cases of ovarian cancer each year, accounting for around 4% of all cancers diagnosed in women and giving a cumulative lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 0.5% (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2012</LINK>). In Europe, ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynaecological cancer death, with just over a third of women alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sant-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sant 2003</LINK>). Ovarian cancer is associated with high mortality rates because most women are diagnosed when the cancer is already at an advanced stage and surgical cure is impossible (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over 85% of ovarian cancers develop in the surface (epithelial) cells of the ovary. There are different types based on microscopic features (histopathological types) of which the most common are serous. Endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell cancers are less common and the malignant Brenner type is rare. Malignant tumours are characterised by their grade; this describes the microscopic pattern of growth (architecture) and cellular features (cytology) and varies from well differentiated (grade G1) to moderately and poorly differentiated (G2 and G3 respectively). Well-differentiated tumours are of better prognosis than G2 or G3 tumours. FIGO staging is used to describe the spread of the disease. FIGO stage I disease is confined to one or both ovaries and FIGO stage II disease is limited in spread to the true pelvis. FIGO stage I is subdivided into three stages, Ia to Ic. In stage Ia, the disease is confined to one ovary with no involvement of the ovarian surface and with no tumour cells in the fluid of the abdominal cavity (negative peritoneal washings); stage Ib indicates similarly encapsulated disease in both ovaries but with no evidence of other spread; and stage Ic indicates ovarian cyst rupture or ascites containing malignant cells (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1989</LINK>). FIGO stage II was similarly divided into three substages but stage IIc was abolished in 2014. Stage IIa indicates spread to the uterus or fallopian tubes; and stage IIb indicates spread to other pelvic structures (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for full details of FIGO staging). Less than 30% of women present with stage I or II ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women with early ovarian cancer should be offered surgery, both to remove the disease and to provide accurate staging, which is a key factor in assessing the impact of different treatments in this patient group. The pattern of spread of ovarian cancer is such that small deposits of tumour 'hidden' in the upper abdomen and retro-peritoneum can be readily missed. It has been shown that a significant percentage of women will be understaged if the initial staging surgery is suboptimal. If upper abdominal disease is missed, a women with apparent stage Ic disease may actually have stage III disease. Currently there is a lack of accurate molecular or imaging markers to predict prognosis and identify women with occult disease. Accurate staging helps provide better prediction of outcome in individual cases, is an independent prognostic factor for survival in stage I disease (<LINK REF="REF-Trimbos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trimbos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetta 1998</LINK>), and influences ongoing management.</P>
<P>Recent reports have confirmed a very good prognosis for women with stage Ia disease treated with conservation of the contralateral ovary in order to preserve their fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Morice-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schilder-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schilder 2002</LINK>). A proportion of patients with stage I disease will be cured by their surgery and it may be that the chance of survival is improved if the surgery is undertaken by a trained gynaecological oncologist (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1992</LINK>). There is evidence from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy will identify more women with lymph node metastases than sampling of suspicious nodes (<LINK REF="STD-Maggioni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maggioni 2006</LINK>); no survival difference was seen in this trial although it was underpowered to examine this outcome. There is, however, a high incidence of recurrent disease, which can be as high as 30% in certain subgroups of women with stage I disease. The challenge is to determine which patients are at high risk and would benefit most from additional treatment.</P>
<P>Uncontrolled retrospective studies have identified prognostic factors of importance for this disease. A multivariate analysis of 1545 patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer confirmed tumour grade to be the single most important determinant of survival (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2001</LINK>). In addition, capsular involvement or cyst rupture (FIGO stage Ic) were associated with a poorer outcome. The current staging for ovarian cancer does not recognise the prognostic importance of tumour grade.</P>
<P>Another issue relates to the class of ovarian cancers of low malignant potential known as borderline tumours. These neoplasms tend to run a benign course; however adverse prognostic factors are similarly based on histological features. These concerns have prompted calls for a revision of FIGO staging to incorporate the borderline tumours and endorse the importance of tumour grade (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2003</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adjuvant treatment is any treatment given after surgical removal of all visible disease in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. Given the significant risk of recurrence in subgroups of patients with completely resected early stage disease, adjuvant treatment is usually considered. The rationale for this treatment is to eradicate any microscopic deposits of tumour that may remain after surgery. Several underpowered clinical trials have examined the merits of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant radiotherapy in selected subgroups (<LINK REF="STD-Chiara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chiara 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hreshchyshyn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hreshchyshyn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klaassen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klaassen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sigurdsson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sigurdsson 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane review and meta-analysis of individual patient data (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1999</LINK>) confirmed modest two- and five-year survival advantages in women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer who were given platinum-based combination chemotherapy compared with those given combination therapy lacking platinum (hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.98; <LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-ICON2-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICON2 1998</LINK> subsequently confirmed equivalent efficacy (and lower toxicity) of single-agent carboplatin compared with a combination regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP) and recommended it as the standard initial treatment of advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer. <LINK REF="REF-GOG111-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOG111 1996</LINK> demonstrated that survival was improved by adding paclitaxel to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Hence, the recommended first-line chemotherapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is a platinum agent combined with a taxane. Furthermore, the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup continues to recommend carboplatin and paclitaxel as the standard comparator arm for trials in ovarian cancer treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on the results seen in advanced disease, platinum-based chemotherapy has been adopted for use in early stage disease. Accepted practice in the UK is to offer six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (with or without a taxane) to women with stage Ic disease or more. With regard to low-risk disease, the NICE 2011 clinical guideline on ovarian cancer states that adjuvant chemotherapy should not be offered to women with low-risk stage I disease (grade 1 or 2, stage Ia or Ib) if they have undergone optimal staging, and should be discussed with women who have had suboptimal staging (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-12-03 13:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various systematic reviews of adjuvant therapy including radiotherapy in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Elit-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elit 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trop_x00e9_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tropé 2007</LINK>; New Reference). Most agree that stage Ia grade 1 disease does not need adjuvant chemotherapy; however, there is confusion over the best management of other early stage tumours as the risks of treatment complications may outweigh the survival benefits. Therefore, the precise role of chemotherapy in stage I disease continues to be the subject of some discussion. Clarity is needed on the subgroups of women, if any, that can safely be managed without adjuvant chemotherapy, and whether particular groups of women have more to gain from it. This updated Cochrane review aims to collate all the relevant data in the area, including long-term data from previously reviewed trials, to determine the overall benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer and to give further guidance on which women should be offered chemotherapy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK> was the first prospective RCT of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage ovarian cancer to include a control group that had no immediate post-surgical treatment, with chemotherapy being reserved for treatment of disease recurrence. This trial was published in 1990, undertaken in the US, and was a joint effort of the Gynecologic Oncology Group and the Ovarian Cancer Study Group. The trial randomised women with FIGO 1976 stage Ia and Ib well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated tumours to receive either Melphalan 0.2 mg/kg or no chemotherapy. These women were surgically staged via a midline laparotomy to allow thorough assessment of the abdomen and pelvis. A total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and infracolic omentectomy was performed and biopsies were taken of any peritoneal deposits. Random biopsies of the pelvic and abdominal peritoneum and retroperitoneal lymph node assessment were also performed. This surgical staging routine is most likely to identify occult metastatic disease if present and therefore is optimal. This trial was flawed by the inclusion of 27 women with the Borderline Ovarian Tumour histological subtype though they were evenly distributed between the two trial arms.</P>
<P>The trial enrolled 92 women, randomising 48 to the chemotherapy arm and 44 to the observation-only arm. After randomisation, 11 women (five in the chemotherapy arm and six in the observation-only arm) were deemed ineligible and so 81 women (43 in the chemotherapy arm and 38 in the observation-only arm) were available for analysis. OS and disease-free survival (DFS) were reported at a median follow-up of six years. Six women died; two in the chemotherapy arm and four in the observation-only arm. Likewise, six women had disease recurrence; two in the chemotherapy arm and four in the observation-only arm. The trial authors reported no significant differences between treatment arms in either OS or DFS. Surviving women were followed up for a median of six years. The trial authors did not report HRs but presented Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank P values for both OS and DFS, based on analysis of all eligible women regardless of the treatment they received. Minimum and maximum duration of follow-up were estimated from censoring marks on the Kaplan-Meier plots.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK> was an Italian multicentre RCT that recruited women with FIGO stage I epithelial ovarian cancer into two trial protocols. In trial 1, trial authors randomised women with stage Ia and Ib G2 and G3 to receive either cisplatin (50 mg/m²) for six cycles or to have no further therapy. The trial authors specified the inclusion of retroperitoneal (pelvic and para-aortic) nodal sampling in the protocol of this trial and therefore staging is optimal. In trial 2, trial authors compared cisplatin to intra-peritoneal radio-isotope in a higher risk group of women; we did not include trial 2 in our review because it did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Trial 1 enrolled 85 women, randomising 41 to the chemotherapy arm and 44 to the observation-only arm. After randomisation, two women (both in the observation-only arm) were deemed ineligible and so 83 women (41 in the chemotherapy arm and 42 in the observation-only arm) were available for analysis. The trial reported OS and PFS. Seventeen women died; nine in the chemotherapy arm and eight in the observation-only arm. Twenty-one women had disease recurrence: seven in the chemotherapy arm and 14 in the observation-only arm. The trial authors reported no significant differences between treatment arms in either OS or PFS. The five-year DFS was 83% for women receiving cisplatin and 64% for the control group; the five-year OS was 87% and 81% in the cisplatin and control groups respectively. Trial authors followed up women for a median of 69 months.</P>
<P>The trial reported HRs for OS and PFS and their 95% CIs, adjusted for tumour grade. These were based on analysis of all eligible women according to the treatment allocated by randomisation.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK> was a Scandinavian multicentre RCT in women with high-risk stage I epithelial ovarian cancer, which compared adjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy versus observation with treatment on clinical recurrence. The entry criteria for this trial were: FIGO stage I non-clear cell carcinoma G2 to G3 after a stipulated staging laparotomy via a midline incision with a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and an infracolic omentectomy. The trial authors obtained peritoneal washings and performed a thorough assessment of peritoneal surfaces with biopsy of any suspicious peritoneal or retroperitoneal lesions. The surgical staging protocol did not stipulate a systematic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy although this was recommended as being optimal.</P>
<P>This trial had two aims, firstly to determine if there was a survival advantage for patients having adjuvant chemotherapy and secondly to test whether DNA ploidy was an independent prognostic factor in high-risk (non-clear cell) stage I epithelial ovarian cancer. The treatment protocol was with carboplatin intravenously dosed at AUC7 according to Calvert's formula (<LINK REF="REF-Calvert-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvert 1989</LINK>) for six courses.</P>
<P>The trial included 175 women. After randomisation, the trial authors deemed 13 women ineligible and so 162 women (81 in each arm) were available for analysis. The trial reported DSS (i.e. survival of women who did not die of ovarian cancer or complications of treatment) and DFS. Eighteen women died of ovarian cancer; nine in both arms. Thirty-nine women had disease progression; 20 in the chemotherapy arm and 19 in the observation-only arm. The trial authors reported no significant differences between treatment arms in either DSS or PFS, and followed up women for a median of 46 months.</P>
<P>The trial reported unadjusted HRs for DSS and PFS and their 95% CIs. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed DNA ploidy, tumour grade and FIGO substage as independent prognostic determinants of DSS.</P>
<P>Adverse events were not reported.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> was a pragmatic trial of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer. The trial recruited women from five countries: UK, Ireland, Brazil, Italy, and Switzerland. Computerised randomisation was done from offices in Milan and London. It was run alongside another collaborative trial, <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK>, and reported simultaneously with it. It was pragmatic about the entry criteria as well as the treatment protocol. Clinicians were asked to recruit women with histologically confirmed invasive epithelial cancer in whom there was some uncertainty of the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. Most women (98%) had FIGO stage I disease, and the remainder had stage II disease. Thirteen per cent had FIGO stage Ia grade 1. Recommended surgical staging was less stringent in this trial than in the <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> trial, with the minimum requirement being for women to have had removal of all visible tumour with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, where appropriate, and omentectomy. The minimal recommendation for 'peritoneal surgical staging' means that women were suboptimally staged in <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Most women in the treatment group (87%) had carboplatin (AUC5), 11% had cisplatin in combinations, and a smaller percentage had other platinum-based regimens.</P>
<P>The trial enrolled 477 women, randomising 241 to the chemotherapy arm and 236 to the observation-only arm. Despite protocol violations, all analyses were on an ITT basis. The trial reported OS and RFS after five-year follow-up. One hundred and three women died; 42 in the chemotherapy arm and 61 in the observation-only arm. One hundred and seven women had disease recurrence: 47 in the chemotherapy arm and 60 in the observation-only arm. The trial authors reported a statistically significant benefit of chemotherapy in terms of both OS and RFS. The trial followed up surviving women for a median of 51 months and reported unadjusted HRs for OS and PFS and their 95% CIs (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91, respectively). Five-year survival was 79% among women who had chemotherapy compared to 70% among those who did not.</P>
<P>The trial reported adverse events in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm but not in the observation arm.</P>
<P>An abstract by <LINK REF="REF-Swart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swart 2007 </LINK>initially reported the longer term follow-up of this trial and was robust to the five-year data. After median follow-up of 9.2 years, 144 women had died and 168 had disease recurrence. The abstract reported unadjusted HRs for OS and PFS and their 95% CIs (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02; and HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, respectively). Ten-year survival was 72% among women who had chemotherapy compared to 64% among those who did not. This abstract also reported the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy, subgrouped by level of risk, namely low/intermediate risk (Ia, G1 and G2, Ib or Ic, G1) and high risk (Ia, G3, Ib or Ic G2 or G3, any clear cell). Among the women at high risk, those who received adjuvant chemotherapy had significantly better OS and RFS than those who did not receive chemotherapy (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.72; and HR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.82, respectively), whereas among the low/intermediate risk group, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes between treatment arms (HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.54 to 1.66; and HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.38, respectively). <LINK REF="REF-Collinson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collinson 2014</LINK> recently reported long term results, with a median follow-up of 10 years that was completed in 2007. In the latter report, 165 women had experienced recurrence during the period and 151 had died.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> was a trial conducted at the same time as the <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> trial by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) collaborators and recruited 448 women. This was a multicentre trial with centralised computer randomisation in Brussels. Nine countries recruited women between November 1990 and January 2000. Entry criteria were more stringent than in the <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> trial. The trial was open to women with stage Ia and Ib G2 and G3 (moderate and poorly differentiated tumours), and all stage Ic and stage Ia. Surgical staging was also specified and optimal staging to include pelvic and para-aortic retroperitoneal node dissection was strongly recommended. A pre-planned examination of the impact of surgical staging on survival outcome required careful documentation of surgical staging for each case, which was categorized as being inadequate, minimal, modified, or optimal.</P>
<P>The allowed chemotherapy regimens were single agent or combinations based on either cisplatin at 75 mg/m² or carboplatin at 350 mg/m². Of the evaluable women who were randomised to receive chemotherapy, 47% had cisplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide and 33% had single-agent carboplatin. Women in the control group had no adjuvant treatment. They were followed up and chemotherapy reserved for cases of disease recurrence.</P>
<P>The trial enrolled 448 women, randomising 224 to each arm. Despite protocol violations, all analyses were on an ITT basis. The trial reported OS and RFS. Seventy-eight women died; 33 in the chemotherapy arm and 45 in the observation-only arm. One hundred women had disease recurrence; 40 in the chemotherapy arm and 60 in the observation-only arm. The trial authors reported a statistically significant benefit of chemotherapy in terms of RFS and a benefit in terms of OS which was not statistically significant. Women were followed up for a median of 5.5 years.</P>
<P>The trial reported unadjusted HRs for OS and RFS and their 95% CIs (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08; and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92, respectively). Five-year survival was 76% among women who had chemotherapy compared to 68% among those who did not. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that staging adequacy and tumour grade were statistically significant prognostic factors for both OS and RFS.</P>
<P>Adverse events were not reported.</P>
<P>In a pre-planned subgroup analysis, the trial dichotomised staging adequacy into optimal and suboptimal groups. Among the 295 suboptimally staged women, the trial authors reported those who received adjuvant chemotherapy had significantly better OS and RFS than those who did not receive chemotherapy; whereas among the 151 optimally staged women, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes between treatment arms.</P>
<P>Long-term results of this trial (median follow-up of 10.1 years) confirmed the original findings, that optimal surgical staging was associated with better outcomes and the survival benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy were limited to those women with suboptimal staging (<LINK REF="REF-Trimbos-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trimbos 2010</LINK>). However, the 10-year follow-up report stated disease specific survival (DSS) instead of OS.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Four included trials used cisplatin-based chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK>), while one used melphalan (<LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK>). The trials had some important differences related to inclusion criteria, treatment arm protocols, trial size, and results statistic. The three oldest trials all recruited a small numbers of participants and so may have lacked the statistical power to detect a treatment effect even if one was present (<LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK>). In contrast, the two more recent trials, <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>, were each much larger than preceding trials. Since they were run in parallel and reported in a joint analysis, the 'combined trial' had sufficient power to demonstrate a treatment effect. The <LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK> trial protocol specified examination of the retroperitoneal nodal groups at laparotomy in addition to peritoneal staging, and <LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK> specified sampling of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes; however, the <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> protocol made no such stipulation. As such the women in the latter trial were regarded to have been sub-optimally staged and may have included some women with occult advanced disease. </P>
<P>An important difference between <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> and the other trials was the predetermined intention of the trial authors to examine, in a subgroup, the effect of staging adequacy in either trial arm. Roughly one-third of the women recruited to this trial had more thorough surgical staging (described as optimal as opposed to adequate). This is an important difference because it is recognised that more thorough surgical staging (specifically retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) will result in a more accurate identification of women with occult advanced disease and women with disease confined to the ovary.</P>

One study reported disease-specific survival (DSS) (<LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK>), defined as survival until death from ovarian cancer or from complications of treatment for the disease, with deaths from other causes being censored, and <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> reported DSS for the analysis of 10-year data.</P>
<P>We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK> from all meta-analyses since the data reported in the published report were not internally consistent: table 3 in the trial paper reported one disease recurrence in the chemotherapy group whereas figure 1 in the trial paper showed two disease recurrences in this group; table 3 reported deaths at 35 and 38 months in the chemotherapy group whereas figure 2 showed deaths at 38 and 75 months in this group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall survival</HEADING>
<P>Five-year OS was significantly better for women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy than for women in the observation group (1008 women, three studies; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93), with no heterogeneity between studies (I² statistic = 0%).

<P>The results of the 10-year OS meta-analysis (incorporating <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> data) were robust to the five-year findings and showed a significant difference between the two groups in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 925 women, two studies; I² statistic = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Overall, 25% (118/465) and 33% (152/460) of the women in the adjuvant chemotherapy group and observation groups, respectively, had died at a median follow-up of 10 years.

At a median follow-up of five years, the test for subgroup differences suggested that the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation might differ between these subgroups, with no apparent additional benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in the group that was optimally staged; however, subgroup differences were not statistically significant (Chi² test = 3.14, df = 1, P = 0.08; I² statistic = 68.1%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> reported 10-year DSS instead of OS and considered the findings robust to the five-year data. For the subgroup of suboptimally staged women, DSS was significantly better in the adjuvant chemotherapy group compared with observation (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.96; 151 women, one trial; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); whereas in the optimally staged group, chemotherapy provided no significant benefit over observation (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.09; 151 women, one trial). However, the test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (Test for subgroup differences: Chi² test = 3.32, df = 1; P = 0.07; I² statistic = 69.9%). In this analysis we had risk of bias concerns about the preferential reporting of DSS instead of OS for 10-year follow-up. In addition, the number of events in the optimally staged subgroup was small. Therefore, we performed an exploratory analysis of 'deaths from ovarian cancer' at 10 years using dichotomous data from <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>; this analysis suggested that the difference between subgroups in deaths from ovarian cancer was not statistically significant (Test for subgroup differences: Chi² test = 2.75, df = 1, P = 0.10; I² statistic = 63.6%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included five RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK>), of which four studies evaluating platinum-based chemotherapy were of sufficient quality to contribute to meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK>; see 'Summary of findings' table 1). In total, 1170 women contributed data.</P>
<P>In women with early stage (FIGO I/IIa) epithelial ovarian cancer, those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had a better five-year overall survival (OS) (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93) and PFS (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84) than those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. At five-year follow-up, almost 30% fewer women in the adjuvant chemotherapy group had died compared with the observation group. However, between nine and 100 women would have to be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent one death and between seven and 33 women was the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one case of disease progression or recurrence. The survival benefit of chemotherapy was still evident at 10 years (two studies, 925 women; PFS: HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83; OS: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92), for which the NNTB was 13 to prevent one death (95% CI 8 to 51), and 10 to prevent one recurrence (95% CI 7 to 20). We considered this evidence to be high quality according to the GRADE approach. Adjuvant chemotherapy benefited women who were suboptimally staged or those who had high risk disease. However, subgroup analyses could neither confirm nor exclude a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for optimally-staged women and women with low or intermediate risk disease at a median follow-up of 10 years.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:14:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The high number of women included in this Cochrane review gives clear and consistent evidence of the overall benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with early stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stage I/IIa) on survival outcomes. Whilst the real value of adjuvant chemotherapy may be in the treatment of occult disease, we found insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude a beneficial effect in women who are optimally staged. It is likely that most women treated worldwide for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer are suboptimally staged, particularly since, even in <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> when comprehensive surgical staging was strongly advised, it was only performed in a third of women participating in the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Timmers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmers 2010</LINK>). Basing therapeutic management of early stage ovarian cancer on the adequacy of surgical staging is currently not supported by robust evidence and may not be clinically feasible given that the diagnosis of early stage ovarian cancer at the time of surgery is often not known.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the evidence relating to women with low and intermediate risk stage I ovarian cancer is incomplete. Few women in these studies had stage Ia grade 1 (low-risk disease) and we are very uncertain about whether the results of this review apply to this risk group. Furthermore, more evidence is needed to clarify to what extent adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival of women with intermediate-risk disease. Although certain subgroup findings suggested that there might be a difference in survival benefits according to extent of disease or risk, these may have been chance findings. It has been shown that if an overall treatment effect is statistically significant at the 5% level (as adjuvant chemotherapy is in our meta-analyses) and the women are divided at random into two similarly sized subgroups, then there is a one in three chance that the treatment effect will be large and statistically significant in one group but irrelevant and non-significant in the other (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately none of the included studies assessed the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on the quality of life of the women. In addition, adverse events were poorly reported and did not use consistent definitions (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NCI-CTCAE-v3.0-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI CTCAE v3.0 2006</LINK>). Only three included studies reported adverse events in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1990</LINK>); and no included studies reported adverse events in women who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. To our knowledge, long term risks of adjuvant chemotherapy in ovarian cancer survivors have not been reported.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:17:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered the evidence for the primary outcomes, OS and PFS, to be of high quality (see 'Summary of findings' table 1), whereas we considered the quality of evidence relating to subgroup analyses to be low (for analyses according to risk) or very low (for analyses according to adequacy of staging).</P>
<P>With regard to subgroup findings according to surgical staging, the <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> trial was not designed to compare different surgical staging procedures, nor were women prospectively stratified by these categories. In addition, the numbers of women in the 'optimally staged' subgroup in meta-analyses were small. DSS was preferentially reported in the 10-year follow-up report, instead of OS, which was reported in the five-year follow-up report, and were not consistent with the PFS findings. Thus the findings for the subgroup analysis according to adequacy of surgical staging were ambiguous and we judged them to be very low quality.</P>
<P>For the subgroup findings according to risk, subgrouping in the contributing trial (<LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>) was performed post-hoc. At the time of the previous update, only limited data were available in the form of a conference abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Swart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swart 2007</LINK>). Further evidence relating to these risk subgroups has now been published (<LINK REF="REF-Collinson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collinson 2014</LINK>), which has not substantially changed the estimates of effect. However, a more complete d ata set including absolute number of events was available in <LINK REF="REF-Collinson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collinson 2014</LINK>. Although the trial authors stated that they had performed classification of trial participants into low, intermediate, and high risk groups before the dataset was locked for analysis, we had concerns that by combining the low risk group with the intermediate risk group to increase the power of the analysis they may have introduced bias into these analyses, and the analysis remained underpowered. We therefore judged the evidence from these subgroup analyses to be low quality.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-12-03 14:13:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted this Cochrane review according to the recommended Cochrane methodology to reduce the risk of bias in the review process. For the first update in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2012</LINK>), we added a subgroup analysis by risk of recurrence/progression that we had not included in the original protocol of this review. By so doing, based on the <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> trial, we may have introduced a potential source of bias. Similarly, we assigned <LINK REF="STD-Trop_x00e9_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tropé 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bolis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolis 1995</LINK> to the 'optimal staging' subgroup and <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> to the 'sub-optimal staging' subgroup post hoc and subjectively.</P>
<P>In this update, we added meta-analysis of dichotomous survival data, and used these RRs to inform illustrative comparative risks ('Summary of findings' table 1) and Cates' plots. In addition, although we had not specified it in the protocol, we graded the subgroup evidence in order to illustrate our uncertainty in the quality of the subgroup evidence.</P>
<P>A limitation of the review protocol is that we did not include quality of life as an outcome.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:22:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of chemotherapy in early stage epithelial ovarian cancer and the completeness of surgical staging in women with apparent early stage disease are interlinked issues and any discussion of the management of these women must consider both. There remains active debate in UK gynaecological oncology circles about lymphadenectomy in early stage epithelial ovarian cancer with many believing in the necessity of a systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy for accurate staging. This is because, when retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is not performed, there is a significant risk of failing to identify occult disease. Since the prognosis for women with para-aortic or pelvic node involvement is worse than for women with true stage I or II disease, any intervention trials with outcomes that group true early stage disease with occult stage IIIa disease will necessarily be very difficult to interpret. This may have been the case in <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK>, and a possible reason why the death rate at 10 years was relatively high in the low and intermediate risk group of this trial, at around 20%. However, <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> was a pragmatic trial and others may argue that it reflects the 'real life' scenario, where surgical staging is often inadequate in early stage disease.</P>
<P>NICE guidance on the diagnosis and initial treatment of women with ovarian cancer has taken a pragmatic line in its advice on the role of para-aortic node dissection in early stage disease (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). It does not recommend systematic lymphadenectomy but rather advocates lymph node assessment by palpation and sampling of any suspiciously enlarged nodes. It argues that the morbidity of a comprehensive para-aortic lymphadenectomy cannot be justified. In which case, perhaps adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage disease is the lesser evil.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:22:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High quality evidence indicates that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is effective in prolonging survival in women with early stage (FIGO stage I/IIa) epithelial ovarian cancer. Low quality evidence suggests that survival benefits may be greatest in women with high risk disease; however, uncertainty remains for lower risk early stage disease. Decisions to use AC in lower risk disease should be mindful of this uncertainty, and the uncertainty regarding adverse events, with treatment in lower risk disease individualised to take into account individual factors.</P>
<P>Cates plots may be helpful in counselling women about the relative survival benefits with adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-12-03 15:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is remarkable that two reasonably large studies have reported 10-year follow-up data and it is possible that even longer follow-up could be attempted. Fifteen year follow-up data could shed further light on survival as well as potential long term risks of adjuvant chemotherapy, including secondary cancers. <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> investigators might consider conducting subgroup analysis by risk. In addition, meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) if made available by <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ICON1-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ICON1 2003</LINK> could help to confirm or exclude subgroup differences.</P>
<P>There are still deficiencies in the evidence which can be addressed in the context of a collaborative trial. The <LINK REF="STD-ACTION-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ACTION 2003</LINK> investigators have proposed a trial in which women who are suboptimally staged are randomised either to have a staging laparotomy or to have adjuvant chemotherapy. The trial authors propose a trial in apparent early ovarian cancer with two levels of randomisation; the first step would randomise participants to either optimal staging or peritoneal staging. The trial would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy to all patients with high-grade tumours. In the second step, the trial would randomly assign women with 'low risk' histology in the peritoneal staging arm to either adjuvant chemotherapy or observation and would observe those optimally staged. Such a trial would evaluate firstly whether there is a survival advantage to retroperitoneal node sampling in early stage ovarian cancer and secondly whether a group of women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer can safely be managed without adjuvant chemotherapy. However, phase 3 trials of early ovarian cancer are difficult to conduct because of the relatively small number of women with early stage disease. Consensus from the 4th Ovarian Cancer Conference of the Gynaecologic Cancer InterGroup recommends that the primary endpoint for these trials is therefore RFS (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 2011</LINK>). FIGO staging was updated in January 2014 to subdivide stage 1C and abolish stage IIC altogether. This doesn't affect the results of this report, but will impact on studies of early stage disease in the future.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-03 14:55:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We evaluated risk of bias using the following criteria:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it had produced comparable groups. We assessed the method as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. a computer-generated random sequence or a table of random numbers);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. quasi-randomised: date of birth, clinic ID number or surname);</LI>
<LI>unclear, e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (e.g. open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>unclear, e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Loss to follow-up/incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias)</HEADING>
<P>We recorded the proportion of participants whose outcomes were not reported at the end of the study; we noted if loss to follow-up was not reported. We assessed loss to follow-up as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, if fewer than 20% of patients were lost to follow-up and reasons for loss to follow-up were similar in both treatment arms;</LI>
<LI>high risk, if more than 20% of patients were lost to follow-up or reasons for loss to follow-up differed between treatment arms;</LI>
<LI>unclear, if loss to follow-up was not reported.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias. We assessed the methods as:</P>
