<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-25 13:19:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is the most common form of glaucoma and an important cause of blindness. Having a high intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor. Treatment for OAG aims to lower the IOP and thus reduce the risk of progressive loss of vision. IOP can be lowered by medications (eye drops), laser therapy or surgery. There are many different types of eye drops available and these are compared in a Cochrane review (<A HREF="Vass 2007">Vass 2007</A>). Surgery for glaucoma has also evolved in the last 40 years. The most common type is called trabeculectomy, or drainage surgery, that creates an opening at the wall of the eye to release fluid and reduce the IOP. Surgery may have complications during and after the operation and may fail in the long-term due to scarring. Drainage surgery forms a 'bleb' i.e. small blister like elevation on the surface of the eye which can sometimes be uncomfortable.</P>
<P>It is not clear whether medication or surgery is the better treatment for OAG. The purpose of this review was to review and assess evidence from randomised studies to compare treatment with medications with surgical treatments in terms of how well they work, their relative safety and cost-effectiveness. Four relevant trials were identified, treating 888 people. Three studies were in the UK and one in the US. These trials had been initiated over many years from 1968 up to the most recent trial in 1993. The earlier trials used medications, and in one trial surgical techniques that are now rarely used. Findings of these studies suggest that, in mild OAG, worsening of the condition was not different whether first treatment was medication or surgery, but surgery was associated with more eye discomfort at five years. In more severe glaucoma, surgery lowered IOP significantly more than medications (not widely used anymore) and reduced the risk of progressive loss of visual field. In three trials the risk of developing cataract was higher with surgery (trabeculectomy), although in one trial with follow-up beyond five years there was no difference in the number of cataract surgeries between treatment groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine how well more recently available medications work compared with surgery in more severe OAG, and which was the more cost-effective treatment option. More research is required.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:54:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials involving 888 participants with previously untreated OAG were included. Surgery was Scheie's procedure in one trial and trabeculectomy in three trials. In three trials, primary medication was usually pilocarpine, in one trial it was a beta-blocker.</P>
<P>The most recent trial included participants with on average mild OAG. At five years, the risk of progressive visual field loss, based on a three unit change of a composite visual field score, was not significantly different according to initial medication or initial trabeculectomy (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.01). In an analysis based on mean difference (MD) as a single index of visual field loss, the between treatment group difference in MD was -0.20 decibel (dB) (95% CI -1.31 to 0.91). For a subgroup with more severe glaucoma (MD -10 dB), findings from an exploratory analysis suggest that initial trabeculectomy was associated with marginally less visual field loss at five years than initial medication, (mean difference 0.74 dB (95% CI -0.00 to 1.48). Initial trabeculectomy was associated with lower average intraocular pressure (IOP) (mean difference 2.20 mmHg (95% CI 1.63 to 2.77) but more eye symptoms than medication (P = 0.0053). Beyond five years, visual acuity did not differ according to initial treatment (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.81).</P>
<P>From three trials in more severe OAG, there is some evidence that medication was associated with more progressive visual field loss and 3 to 8 mmHg less IOP lowering than surgery. In the longer-term (two trials) the risk of failure of the randomised treatment was greater with medication than trabeculectomy (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.60 to 9.53; hazard ratio (HR) 7.27, 95% CI 2.23 to 25.71). Medications and surgery have evolved since these trials were undertaken.</P>
<P>In three trials the risk of developing cataract was higher with trabeculectomy (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.64 to 4.42). Evidence from one trial suggests that, beyond five years, the risk of needing cataract surgery did not differ according to initial treatment policy (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.62).</P>

<P>Primary surgery lowers IOP more than primary medication but is associated with more eye discomfort.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-25 13:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glaucoma describes a group of eye diseases in which there is progressive damage to the optic nerve characterised by specific structural abnormalities of optic nerve head and patterns of visual field loss. The primary glaucomas (those that are not as a consequence of other eye or systemic disease) can be classified as open angle glaucoma (OAG) or angle closure glaucoma. OAG is a multi-factorial optic neuropathy in which there is a characteristic acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2000</LINK>) in which the drainage angle and trabecular meshwork is clearly visible and has a normal appearance on gonioscopy.</P>
<P>In 1990 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 38 million people were blind worldwide, with 15% due to glaucoma; second only to cataract as the leading cause of blindness (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). In Europe, glaucoma accounts for 7% to 15% of all blind registrations and is second to age-related macular degeneration as the main cause (<LINK REF="REF-Bunce-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunce 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuchs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchs 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghafour-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghafour 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klaver-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaver 1998</LINK>). OAG is the most common form of glaucoma; it accounts for 75% to 95% of primary glaucomas except in people of Eastern Asian (Mongoloid) descent, where angle closure glaucoma is more prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 1992</LINK>). The risk factors for developing OAG, identified from population studies, are raised intraocular pressure (IOP), increasing age, African American or African Caribbean ethnic origin, family history and myopia (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2006)</LINK>. The average age of diagnosis is estimated at 62 years for non-white and 70 years for white populations (<LINK REF="REF-Leske-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 1983</LINK>). Blindness due to OAG occurs in an estimated 4% of cases in a white population, but is more common (8%) and occurs at an earlier age in a non-white population (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>OAG is painless. In the early stages of disease the visual loss is in the mid-peripheral field of vision and individuals are generally asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2001</LINK>). In the later stages of disease visual field loss impacts on central vision and affects health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>OAG is not defined by the presence of elevated IOP. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy can develop in the absence of documented elevated IOP. This condition has been termed normal pressure or normal tension glaucoma. There is debate as to whether normal tension glaucoma is a separate entity or a subtype of primary open angle glaucoma existing as a spectrum of the same disease. There may be different risk factors, different patterns of damage and different natural history in normal tension glaucoma, but the clinical findings and the treatment for progressive disease is similar (<LINK REF="REF-Caprioli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caprioli 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review OAG includes the following subgroups.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterised by:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>adult onset;</LI>
<LI>mean untreated IOP above 21 mmHg;</LI>
<LI>open drainage angle on gonioscopy without any pathological features;</LI>
<LI>evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy from either the appearance of the optic disc or retinal nerve fibre layer and/or the presence of characteristic abnormalities in the visual field; and</LI>
<LI>absence of any secondary causes of IOP elevation.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Normal pressure glaucoma</LI>
<UL>
<LI>All the features of POAG apart from a mean pretreatment IOP less than or equal to 21 mmHg. Interventions for normal pressure glaucoma are the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sycha-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sycha 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma</LI>
<UL>
<LI>All the features of POAG or normal pressure glaucoma and additionally deposition of the characteristic exfoliative material on the anterior lens surface, pupil margin and other parts of the anterior segment of the eye.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Pigmentary glaucoma</LI>
<UL>
<LI>All the features of POAG with the addition of pigment deposition in the open drainage angle together with characteristic pigment dispersion in the anterior segment of the eye (Krukenberg spindle - pigment on the corneal endothelium and transillumination of the mid-periphery of the iris).</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
<P>Treatment aims to prevent visual disability and preserve overall well-being for patients with glaucoma. The visual loss in glaucoma is due to the death of retinal ganglion cells, which is thought to occur by a mechanism of genetically programmed cell death called apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kerrigan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerrigan 1997</LINK>). Vascular and or mechanical factors at the optic nerve head may precipitate the cell death and IOP may be implicated in either or both of these mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Fechtner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fechtner 1994</LINK>). Other factors, such as elevated nitric oxide and glutamate levels in the eye and autoimmune mechanisms, may also contribute to this process. Research is ongoing for therapies other than reducing IOP which might be of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 1999</LINK>). Currently, IOP is the only risk factor that can be treated, and lowering IOP has been shown to be beneficial in reducing progression of visual field loss in glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Drugs</HEADING>
<P>Medical treatment can be delivered topically as eye drops or systemically. For more than two decades the first line of medical treatment for OAG has been topical beta-blockers. These lower IOP but with the possibility of adverse systemic side effects, particularly in an elderly population (<LINK REF="REF-Diggory-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diggory 1995</LINK>). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors taken systemically lower IOP and can be used as long-term medication but they are often poorly tolerated. With the introduction of newer topical agents their use is now restricted to refractory cases. In the mid-1990s, alternative medical treatments such as topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha2-agonists and prostaglandin analogues were introduced, increasing not only the therapeutic options but also the cost of medical antiglaucoma treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2001</LINK>). Reduced surgical rates for glaucoma are felt to be a consequence of the introduction of the new treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2002</LINK>). Long-term medication may not be acceptable or possible as individuals may have difficulties adhering to treatment. In developing countries, medications may not be available or may be too costly for long-term use. Medical interventions for primary OAG are the subject of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Vass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vass 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Laser</HEADING>
<P>An alternative or additive treatment to the use of medications is discrete laser ablation to areas of the trabecular meshwork of the drainage angle. Laser trabeculoplasty is the subject of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Rolim-de-Moura-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolim de Moura 2007</LINK>). Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation uses a laser to deliver thermal energy to the ciliary body and decreases the production of aqueous humour. It has been used as a primary treatment modality in OAG although its use is usually reserved for those cases not responding to other modes of treatment because of the potential risk of serious loss of vision following the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egbert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Egbert 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Surgical</HEADING>
<P>Glaucoma drainage surgery aims to lower the IOP by creating an alternative route for aqueous humour outflow. Glaucoma surgical techniques have evolved over the last 40 years from full thickness procedures, to guarded filtration procedures (trabeculectomy). Full thickness procedures are now not recommended due to a higher risk of complications compared with guarded filtration procedures.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Trabeculectomy</HEADING>
<P>Trabeculectomy is a guarded filtration procedure whereby the IOP is lowered by creation of a fistula to drain aqueous humour from within the eye globe into the subconjunctival space to create a filtering bleb. It was developed in the UK in 1968 and is currently the standard operation in OAG (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1981</LINK>), although it can be associated with potentially vision-threatening complications such as over-filtration, hypotony and infection. Success rates for trabeculectomy depend on the criteria used to define success, the level of IOP or long-term visual field stability. The development of scar tissue under the conjunctiva leads to inadequate drainage in trabeculectomy procedures. Anti-scarring agents such as 5-Fluorouracil, Mitomycin-C and Beta-Radiation can be used as an adjunct to trabeculectomy to limit the scarring process. Cochrane reviews of 5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycin-C found that their use appears to improve success rates of surgery, but may increase the incidence of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2001</LINK>). Trabeculectomy with beta irradiation has a lower risk of surgical failure compared to trabeculectomy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kirwan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirwan 2002</LINK>). The comparative effectiveness of beta irradiation versus anti-metabolite is uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Non-penetrating trabeculectomy</HEADING>
<P>Non-penetrating surgical procedures (viscocanalostomy and deep sclerectomy) have been developed, which avoid full thickness penetration into the anterior chamber of the eye. These have reportedly fewer complications but may have limited effectiveness at lowering IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Netland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Netland 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Glaucoma drainage devices</HEADING>
<P>Aqueous shunt devices have been developed which aim to maintain drainage of aqueous humour in spite of subconjunctival scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 1998</LINK>); these are usually reserved for situations where trabeculectomy is unlikely to succeed and is not generally accepted as an alternative to standard filtration surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Gedde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gedde 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minckler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Alternative microsurgical procedures on the trabecular meshwork (trabecular aspiration, goniocurettage, laser trabecular ablation, angle shunting devices and trabeculotomy) have been described as a means of lowering IOP in OAG. These techniques are not widely used and their safety and effectiveness is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Chihara-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chihara 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobi 2000</LINK>). Lowering the IOP may also be achieved by reducing the production of aqueous humour by the ciliary body by laser or cryo ablation.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-24 04:50:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medications lower IOP by either decreasing aqueous production or increasing aqueous outflow. Surgery creates an alternative route for aqueous humour outflow. Lowering IOP reduces the risk of progressive visual field loss, (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>) and the likelihood of progression to visual impairment.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:38:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early trials in the UK of initial medical treatment versus trabeculectomy suggest that there is less deterioration of visual fields in the trabeculectomy first group (<LINK REF="REF-Jay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jay 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Migdal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migdal 1994</LINK>). Reports of five-year clinical outcomes of a trial of initial medical versus surgical therapy for OAG show no difference in IOP reduction or rates of visual field progression between the treatment groups, but show a higher incidence of cataract and local eye symptoms in the surgically-treated group (<LINK REF="REF-Lichter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichter 2001</LINK>). With the development of newer medications for OAG and the refinement of surgical techniques, the relative effectiveness of medical and surgical treatments on long-term visual outcomes and quality of life is uncertain. It is also unclear whether the treatment choice should be different for individuals identified at higher risk of blindness, such as people of black ethnicity or people with severe disease at presentation.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Categorical variables</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we analysed visual field progression and visual acuity as categorical variables. If reported as a score, we analysed the data as continuous variables. If summary effect measures were reported, we entered the logarithm of the odds ratio (Ln OR) and the standard error (SE) into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) as generic inverse variance measures. When other studies presented similar outcomes using proportions, we calculated the OR and the 95% confidence interval (CI) and the Ln OR and its SE from the 95% CI and entered them into RevMan as a generic inverse variance effect measure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous variables</HEADING>
<P>We analysed Intraocular pressure (IOP) as a continuous variable. For each study we calculated the mean IOP change from baseline, including the standard deviation (SD) of change for each intervention group, when possible. If the SD of change was not reported, we calculated this assuming a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and endpoint IOP measures (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). In trials where we excluded study failures from the randomised treatment from the IOP analysis, we assigned treatment failures the IOP at baseline. The effect of this assumption was tested in a sensitivity analysis. When means and standard deviations (SDs) were not reported directly, we extracted baseline and endpoint means and the corresponding SD from published graphs, if possible. If neither the SD of change nor the SD of the endpoint measures were available, we used an imputed SD from one of the other included trials. When visual field and visual acuity outcomes were reported as mean scores, we analysed data as mean score change from baseline and the SD of change. In addition, mean scores over time were presented in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>) and we included these differences in the analysis. One study reported health-related quality of life as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>). The health-related quality of life scores are reported as the differences in mean scores between the medical and surgical groups over the study period.

<P>The included trials were initiated over many years from the earliest trial in 1968 up to the most recent trial in 1993. Not only have glaucoma medications and surgical techniques changed over this period but there have been marked technological developments in the measurement of glaucoma visual field loss. Combining study results with such heterogeneous treatments and outcome measures was not sensible and therefore we have described the results for individual studies, apart from the IOP data where data synthesis for trials using similar medications was meaningful.

<P>The aim of this review was to study the comparative effectiveness of medical and surgical treatment for patients with open angle in terms of measures of glaucoma progression and patient reported health-related quality of life. We included four trials involving 888 participants with previously untreated OAG. Surgery was Scheie's procedure in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-GT-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields GT 1968</LINK>) and trabeculectomy in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK>). In three trials, primary medication was usually pilocarpine (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-GT-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields GT 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK>) and in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>) a beta-blocker. The most recent trial, <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>, included participants with OAG at the mild end of the glaucoma spectrum. One hundred and sixty-eight (27%) participants had pre-perimetric glaucoma (glaucoma defined in the basis of raised IOP &#8805; 27 mmHg and glaucomatous optic nerve, but without a visual field defect. The average baseline visual field score was 4.8 on a scale of 0 (no defect) to 20 (all points severely depressed compared with a normal visual field). <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-GT-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields GT 1968</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK> included participants with more severe glaucoma.</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that, in moderate to severe glaucoma and using a treatment regime including pilocarpine (not now considered usual care), lower IOP and preservation of visual field is more likely to be achieved with primary surgery rather than primary medical treatment. In milder glaucoma, the findings from <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> suggest that in the longer- term (defined as five years or longer) there is no substantial difference in progressive visual field loss, after adjustment between initiating medication (usually a beta-blocker) or primary trabeculectomy. In the long-term (follow-up up to nine years) there were more deaths in those treated with initial surgery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Musch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musch 2009</LINK> reports longer-term follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>. An exploratory subgroup analysis suggests that for those of black ethnicity and no cataract the treatment effect on visual field outcome was not modified by ethnic status. But, for participants of black ethnicity undergoing cataract surgery, the visual field loss over time was greater than white participants with cataract. In the long-term, for a subgroup of participants with more severe glaucoma (MD -10 dB), those treated with primary trabeculectomy had a marginally better visual field score than those treated medically. No difference was found for those with milder glaucoma at baseline (MD -2.0 dB). <LINK REF="REF-Parrish-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 2009</LINK> reports the optic nerve findings at five-year follow-up reporting a higher incidence of optic disc progression in the initial medication group at five years. There was differential availability of optic nerve photographs for analysis between groups and thus potential for attrition bias.</P>
<P>Only one study assessed patient reported outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>). Participants who required bilateral treatment were randomised such that the fellow eye received initially the same treatment as the study eye. Several measures were used, both generic and glaucoma specific. Overall, primary trabeculectomy was associated with more difficulty with tasks related to visual acuity and with more symptoms related to local eye discomfort compared to patients treated with initial medical treatment analysed over the five-year follow-up period. No differences were found between the treatment group concerning overall visual function, systemic symptoms, and overall well being. Using a measure specifically designed for <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>, the Symptom Impact Glaucoma Scale, the participants treated by initial trabeculectomy reported 22.3% more symptoms on the total score (P = 0.005). <LINK REF="REF-Musch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musch 2009</LINK> reports longer-term vision specific scores with a median follow-up at 7.7 years. Scores were not reported by randomised group and thus provided no usable data for this review.</P>
<P>Visual acuity change did not differ according to initial treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK> whereas in <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>, trabeculectomy was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of visual acuity, with up to five years follow-up (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.74). The reduced acuity may be due to early cataract that did not require surgery.</P>
<P>In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK>), the risk of developing cataract was higher with trabeculectomy. Overall, cataract surgery was more likely when the initial treatment was trabeculectomy; this was only apparent in the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>). Surgical techniques for cataract have been modified since the early trials with a trend toward surgery at an earlier stage. It may be that there were safety concerns regarding cataract surgery at the time of the early trials that may have precluded surgery. The <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK> found no significant difference in the development of new cataract at one year between the two groups, but this was not reported at final analysis. Longer- term outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> are now reported; At seven year follow-up there was no significant difference in the need for cataract surgery between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Musch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musch 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events were reported by treatment group in the <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>, which reported loss of central fixation in four of the medically-treated participants and no events with trabeculectomy. Side effects related to treatment were not specifically reported in any of the trials, except for <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> where these would be captured in the health-related quality of life measures.</P>
<P>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK>) at up to five-year follow-up medical treatment was associated with a greater risk of failure, in terms of IOP, than trabeculectomy. Medications and surgery have evolved since these trials were undertaken. In <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> at five years the risk of intervention failure was not statistically significantly different between the treatment arms although the medically-treated group were more likely to have progressed in their treatment sequence to argon laser trabeculoplasty than the surgically-treated group at one year. At four years this difference was smaller but still significant. This suggests that many treatment steps are required with initial medical treatment to achieve the desired target IOP, but over longer follow-up primary trabeculectomy patients also require additional treatment.</P>
<P>None of the trials included cost-effectiveness evaluations. The cost-analysis done in the <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK> shows that on a cost only basis, trabeculectomy was slightly more costly than medical treatment over an eight-year period. Modelling estimates of the costs according to a reduced inpatient stay for surgery suggest that by reducing the time of inpatient stay or performing day case surgery, trabeculectomy may be less costly than medical therapy. A formal economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative treatments is required.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-25 12:03:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review includes evidence on the effects of medical and surgical interventions in mild and more severe OAG and includes trials evaluating the medical versus surgical management of OAG initiated over a long period of time, 1968 to 1993. Medical and surgical treatments for OAG have evolved considerably since the first trial of medical versus surgical therapy for OAG. <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-GT-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields GT 1968</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-PTT-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields PTT 1994</LINK> included participants with moderate and severe glaucoma and evaluated interventions that are not now standard therapy for OAG; the results of these trials may not be of relevance to current practice.</P>
<P>Scheie's surgery (the surgical intervention in the <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-GT-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields GT 1968</LINK> trial) is not now considered as a surgical procedure for glaucoma; it is very effective at lowering IOP but it is associated with a high rate of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Blondeau-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blondeau 1981</LINK>). Trabeculectomy is the current surgical procedure of choice. Advances in medical therapy for OAG have changed practice, topical prostaglandin analogues, alpha-2 agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were introduced in the mid-1990s. We did not find any trials comparing medical therapy to other surgical techniques, such as nonpenetrating surgery, tube drainage devices and transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. The latter two surgeries are usually reserved for cases of refractory OAG. In <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> the medical treatments were not defined but treatment was usually a beta-blocker and the protocol allowed medical treatments to be modified according to clinician choice and are likely to have included contemporary treatments.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> is the most relevant study to current practice in Europe and the USA. The participants on average had mild glaucoma (CIGTS visual field score 4.9 (scale of 0 to 20, with 20 indicating severe glaucoma)). Findings from exploratory analyses suggest that although there was no difference in the primary outcome (visual field), progressive glaucomatous optic neuropathy was more likely if initial treatment was medication, and that those with more severe glaucoma may benefit from primary trabeculectomy; further research is required.</P>
<P>The failure of randomised treatment and the need for treatment changes within an intervention arm are important outcomes, particularly when considering the economics of an intervention and patient satisfaction with treatment. The <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-Trial-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow Trial 1988</LINK> compared costs of the alternative treatment strategies, but none of the included studies included an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of alternative initial management strategies.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-25 12:05:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The design and conduct of trials comparing medical therapies versus surgery are complex to design. All the included studies had methodological weaknesses and the findings should be interpreted accordingly. The primary outcomes of this review were progressive visual field loss and health-related quality of life. Different measures of the visual field and definitions of progression were used in each study and thus limited any meta-analysis. This is understandable due to technological advances in visual field testing over the past two decades. In addition, visual field loss is subject to short-term and long-term fluctuation, making the definition of true progressive visual field loss difficult; repeat testing is required to establish that true change has occurred. </P>
<P>The extent of visual field loss is an important clinical outcome. A standardised measure of visual field loss, measurement protocol, and definition of clinical important change is required for future studies. Ony one study (<LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK>) measured patient reported outcomes using a questionnaire designed for the study, comprising 240 questions. The questionnaire was administered by telephone six-monthly throughout the study. Patient reported outcomes are an important complement to clinical outcomes when comparing alternative treatment strategies. However the method of data collection, multiple measures with frequent administration by telephone interview which is not representative of current practice, may have diluted any differences in patient reported outcomes. The effect of this 'attention' is uncertain.</P>

<P>Other studies have confirmed the importance of lowering IOP as a predictor of better outcome in early and late glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kass-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 2002</LINK>). All the included trials showed an increased lowering of IOP by surgery compared to medical treatment at all time points. In <LINK REF="STD-CIGTS" TYPE="STUDY">CIGTS</LINK> the differences were smaller, as expected from the design of the study in which a target IOP was set and treatment escalated accordingly to reach this target. Similarly, the minimal visual filed loss over time may reflect the tight control of IOP in both treatment groups.</P>

<P>Primary surgery lowers IOP more than an initial medication treatment policy. Evidence from one study suggests that at five years follow-up, the average visual field loss is small (-0.2 dB) and not significantly different when primary contemporary medication is compared with trabeculectomy. For a subgroup with more severe glaucoma (MD -10 dB), findings from an exploratory analysis suggest that initial trabeculectomy is associated with marginally less visual field loss at five years than initial medication, (mean difference 0.74 dB (95% CI -0.00 to 1.48)). Primary trabeculectomy is associated with more local eye symptoms, a higher incidence of cataract and reduced visual acuity at up to five years follow-up. Beyond five years, there is no evidence of a difference in the need for cataract surgery according to initial medication or trabeculectomy. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of alternative initial treatment policies is not known.</P>

<P>Classification of visual field changes:</P>
<P>*CIGTS 2001<BR/>The overall visual field score was generated from the total deviation probability plots on the Humphrey 24-2. Each of the 52 points in the field were a point of defect if its probability value was 0.05 or less in the same hemifield. A weight was assigned depending on the minimum depth of defect and the two most defective neighbouring points. A point without two neighbouring points depressed to at least 0.05 is given a weight of 0. The weights are all summed and scaled to 0 (no defect) to 20 (all points showing a defect at P &lt; 0.005 level).</P>
<P>**Glasgow 1988<BR/>Stage 1. Early relative defects(to 1.0/10asb Tubingen; equivalent to 1-2e Goldmann) in arcuate area or nasal step.<BR/>Stage 2 Absolute defects (to 1.0/00asb Tubingen; equivalent to 1-4e Goldmann) outside 10 degrees of fixation in all quadrants.<BR/>Stage 3. As stage 2 but encroaching between 5 and 10 degrees from fixation in 1 to 4 quadrants.<BR/>Stage 4. As stage 2 but within 5 degrees of fixation in 1 to 3 quadrants.<BR/>Stage 5. As stage 2 but within 5 degrees of fixation in all quadrants.</P>
<P>***Moorfields GT 1968<BR/>The Lister-Hamblin chart was ruled with 24 radial lines giving a total number of 960 line degrees in the central 40 degrees of field. Visual field retained was measured as the number of line degrees present (x) in the 40 degree field. Therefore, percentage field retained is x/960x100.</P>
<P>****Moorfields PTT 1994<BR/>Friedmann (Mark 1) analyser used for baseline visual field at entry into the trial and for monitoring progress throughout the trial. The threshold was estimated at intensities of 0.4 log units greater than the threshold intensity then at steps of 0.2 log units up to maximum intensity. A field score of the number of spots missed was calculated at each visit for the relative and absolute spots missed, giving two numeric values for the trial eye at each visit. The mean scores were determined by calculating the mean of the first three visual field scores after entry into the trial and the mean of the final three visual field scores.<BR/>Humphrey automated perimetry: two years after the commencement of the trial Humphrey 30-2 fields, using a size 3 target unless the severity of the visual field defect necessitated the use of a size 5 target, were measured in addition to Friedmann fields. Change was determined by linear regression analysis on each individual retinal points. Those points showing two consecutive significant (at the 0.05% level) positive or negative regression slopes were considered to have improved or worsened respectively. To confirm the visual field loss two significant regression slopes were required, the second field measured after an interval of six months.<BR/>Glaucoma severity:<BR/>Early : Visual field score of &lt; 2 absolute defects(commonly in the arcuate region).<BR/>Middle: Visual field score of 2 to 12 defects (commonly in arcuate region).<BR/>Late: &gt; 12 absolute defects.</P>
