<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Local corticosteroid injection is effective in the short-term for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Local corticosteroid injection is a common non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Other non-surgical treatments include the use of wrist splints, ultrasound and oral anti-inflammatory agents. Surgical intervention is also known to be effective. This systematic review confirmed the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for relief of symptoms for severe carpal tunnel syndrome up to one month after injection. Local corticosteroid injection provides significantly greater clinical improvement compared to oral corticosteroid up to three months after treatment. Two injections of local corticosteroid do not provide significant further clinical improvement of symptoms. Further research is required to determine length of benefit of local corticosteroid injection and benefit for mild and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome has been studied but its effectiveness is unknown.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials register (searched May 2006), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2006) and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2006). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized studies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three authors independently selected the trials and rated their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial and summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 12 studies with altogether 671 participants. Two high quality randomized controlled trials with altogether 141 participants demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month or less following local corticosteroid compared to placebo injection (relative risk 2.58 (95% confidence intervals 1.72 to 3.87)). One trial compared local corticosteroid injection to oral corticosteroid and at 12 weeks after treatment there was significantly more improvement in the injection group (mean difference -7.10 (95% confidence intervals -11.68 to -2.52)). In one trial, the rate of improvement after one month was greater after local than systemic corticosteroid injection (relative risk 3.17 (95% confidence intervals 1.02 to 9.87)). In one trial, symptoms did not improve significantly more in the injection group at eight weeks after injection compared to treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and splinting (mean difference 0.10 (95% confidence intervals -0.33 to 0.53)). Two injections versus one injection of local corticosteroid did not provide further clinical improvement, mean difference -3.80 (95% CI -9.27 to 1.67). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome provides greater clinical improvement in symptoms one month after injection compared to placebo. Significant symptom relief beyond one month has not been demonstrated. Local corticosteroid injection provides significantly greater clinical improvement than oral corticosteroid for up to three months. Local corticosteroid injection does not significantly improve clinical outcome compared to either anti-inflammatory treatment and splinting after eight weeks or Helium-Neon laser treatment after six months. Two local corticosteroid injections do not provide significant added clinical benefit compared to one injection.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-27 20:55:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel in the wrist. These include paraesthesiae, pain and numbness in the fingers and thumb in the distribution of the median nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 1993</LINK>). The severity of CTS ranges from mild to severe. Mild carpal tunnel syndrome presents as intermittent symptoms whereas severe CTS can cause permanent loss of sensation and partial paralysis of the thumb. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common problem encountered in industrialized populations. A Swedish study determined the prevalence of clinically certain CTS in the general population to be 3.8% (95% CI 3.1 to 6.4%) (<LINK REF="REF-Atroshi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atroshi 1999</LINK>). Two recent studies have confirmed high incidence rates in the general population where Bland and Rudolfer demonstrated a rate of 61.5 to 120.5/100,000 women and 35 to 60 cases per 100,000 men in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2003</LINK>). Mondelli et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Mondelli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mondelli 2002</LINK>) identified an even higher incidence rate in the Italian general population of 139 cases per 100,000 men and 506 cases annually per 100,000 women. Bland and Rudolpher (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2003</LINK>) also noted increasing incidence rates but suggested that this was likely to be related to the identification of more mild cases of CTS.</P>
<P>The natural history of CTS has not been well studied. In one study, up to one third of participants had spontaneous improvement of their symptoms without any formal medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Futami-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Futami 1992</LINK>). More recently, Padua et al. have confirmed that a number of persons with CTS improve spontaneously without treatment and a short duration of symptoms is a positive prognostic indicator (<LINK REF="REF-Padua-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padua 2001</LINK>). In this prospective study, for those participants who did not have surgical treatment, 34% had symptom improvement and 45% of participants had stationary symptoms over one year. The treatment of CTS falls into two broad categories, surgical or non-surgical. Surgical treatment is generally preferred in severe cases of CTS, whilst non-surgical treatment is usually initiated for mild to moderate CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1987</LINK>). Examples of non-surgical treatments include wrist splints, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and local corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel. </P>
<P>Corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel has been studied but most studies are either retrospective in design or prospective but non-randomized (<LINK REF="REF-Giannini-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Rossum-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rossum 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1994</LINK>). The effectiveness of corticosteroid injection is not known and recurrence rates of symptoms have varied from eight to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Girlanda-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Girlanda 1993</LINK>). This variation in the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection could be due to a number of reasons such as outcome measures, trial design and patient population examined. Since the prevalence of mild to moderate CTS is high, the impact of this conservative intervention could be significant for managing the syndrome. Also since a significant proportion of CTS cases resolve spontaneously, only controlled trials will provide evidence for the true effectiveness of this intervention. </P>
<P>This systematic review will evaluate the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection of the carpal tunnel for relieving symptoms and preventing eventual surgical treatment.</P>

<P>The setting for one of the included studies, comparing corticosteroid injection to placebo injection (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) was an out-patient neurology clinic in the Netherlands where 84% of the participants were female. Although Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) used peripheral nerve conduction studies to confirm CTS, specific criteria for diagnosis of CTS were not identified. Participants had to have had symptoms for at least three months duration. Severity of CTS was not addressed, but absence of sensory nerve action potentials on electrodiagnostic testing for 80% of participants suggested severe CTS. This study used short acting injectable corticosteroid. Dammers et al. injected 40 mg of methylprednisolone with 10 mg of lignocaine or 10 mg of lignocaine 4 cm proximal to the wrist crease. The primary outcome was clinical assessment, estimated by subjective report of clinical severity. The clinical outcome was the answer to the question whether their symptoms were absent or only minor not requiring treatment or significant enough to require further treatment. Outcomes were recorded at one month with further outcomes measured up to one year.</P>
<P>Similar to <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>, Armstrong et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK>) performed a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial comparing corticosteroid to placebo injections. Only those participants with symptoms of CTS and abnormal NCS were offered entry into the trial. At study commencement, participants completed the Carpal Tunnel Study Functional Status and Symptom Severity Questionnaire. Participants were randomly assigned to the betamethasone (1 ml containing 6 mg) or the placebo group (1 ml saline). Outcomes were initially measured at two weeks with a tolerance of four days. Patient satisfaction with the degree of symptom relief was the primary outcome measured using a five-point scale. Secondary outcomes included (a) changes in NCS and (b) changes in scores on the Carpal Tunnel Study Functional Status and Symptom Severity Questionnaire. Results of initial outcome measures dictated the next treatment phase of the trial. Participants who had received corticosteroid injection and were not satisfied with symptom relief were referred for surgical intervention. Participants who received corticosteroid injections and were highly or somewhat satisfied were enrolled in an 18 month longitudinal study of repeat corticosteroid injections. Placebo participants who were not satisfied with symptom relief were offered corticosteroid injection. Of these participants, those that responded positively to corticosteroid injection were further enrolled in the 18 month longitudinal study. The remainder were referred to surgery. Those participants who initially received placebo and were satisfied with symptom relief were offered either corticosteroid injection or referral to surgery for recurrent symptoms.</P>
<P>One study compared local corticosteroid injection to a single systemic corticosteroid injection (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) in a rheumatology out-patient clinic in Turkey. All the participants were female. Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) used the symptoms of burning and tingling in the thumb, index and long (sic) fingers in conjunction with nocturnal symptoms to confirm the diagnosis. Peripheral NCS were not used. Betamethasone disodium phosphate and acetate suspension (1.5 mg) or an equal volume of saline was injected into the carpal tunnel just proximal to the palm. In this study participants were also injected in the ipsilateral deltoid muscle with the active medication for those who had placebo injected into the carpal tunnel and saline was injected for those who had received betamethasone. Dosages and volumes injected into the deltoid were the same as for those directed to the carpal tunnel. The primary outcome was clinical assessment, estimated by subjective report of clinical severity. Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) used an ordinal ranking scale of symptoms including the terms nil, minimal, moderate and severe. Outcomes were determined at one month after injection.</P>
<P>Wong et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK>) completed a double blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing local corticosteroid injection and oral corticosteroid. The local injection consisted of 15 mg of methylprednisolone injected into the carpal tunnel whereas the oral group received prednisolone 25 mg daily for 10 days. The primary outcome used was the Global Symptom Score at two, eight and 12 weeks. This outcome measure was based on rating the severity of five symptoms (pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness/clumsiness and nocturnal awakening) on a scale from 0 to 10. These scores were added to provide a total score ranging from 0 (absence of symptoms) to 50 (most severe symptoms).</P>
<P>Celiker et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK>) completed an unblinded, randomized controlled trial comparing local corticosteroid injection with the anti-inflammatory medication, acemetacine and splinting. Participants in the injection group received local injection, 4 cm proximal to the wrist crease, of 40 mg of methylprednisolone. In the comparison group, participants received acemetacine 120 mg/day and also were provided with a light weight, neutral angle wrist splint to be worn at night. The main outcome measure used was the Symptom Severity Scale and secondary outcome measures included NCS, Visual Analog Scale for pain, Tinel's sign and Phalen's test. A Symptom Severity Scale measured symptoms based on eleven questions each rated from one to five. The overall score was the mean of the scores for each question. Outcomes were recorded at two and eight weeks after the start of the trial.</P>
<P>Lucantoni et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Lucantoni-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucantoni 1992</LINK>) used an unblinded, randomized controlled trial to compare local corticosteroid injection to Helium-Neon Laser treatment. In the local injection group participants were injected with methylprednisolone 20 mg at the level of the carpal tunnel at baseline and the injection was repeated at 10 days. The laser group received daily 20 minute Helium-Neon Laser treatments at a frequency of 3000 Hz. The treatments lasted for 20 days. The primary outcome was symptom improvement and secondary outcomes were based on NCS recorded at 20 days and six months after the start of the trial.</P>
<P>O'Gradaigh and Merry (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK>) performed a randomized controlled single blind trial of low versus high dose and short versus long acting corticosteroids. Included participants had abnormal CTS or positive Phalen or Tinel tests combined with classic distribution of symptoms. Participants received a 1 ml injection without lignocaine using a 23G needle inserted at the distal carpal skin crease immediately ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon. In the first phase of the trial, participants in Group A received 25 mg of hydrocortisone, Group B received 100 mg of hydrocortisone and Group C had no injection. In Phase two, participants in Group D received 20 mg of triamcinolone, and Group E received 100 mg of hydrocortisone. Participants were assessed at six weeks and six months. The primary outcome was a subjective change in symptoms measured using a five-point scale. Secondary outcomes included changes in NCS and a change from a positive to a negative Phalen or Tinel test.</P>
<P>Habib et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Habib-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Habib 2006</LINK>) completed a randomized, unblinded trial of two different injection techniques. The injection technique varied in two ways. Group 1 (n = 21) was injected with a higher dose of methylprednisolone acetate (35 mg) and lidocaine 2% (0.5 ml) at the wrist crease. Group 2 (n = 21) was injected with only 15 mg of methylprednisolone acetate and 0.15 ml of lidocaine 2% at a location two to three cm distal to the wrist crease. Outcomes included symptomatic improvement at 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks as well as rating of pain from the injection.</P>
<P>Wong et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2005</LINK>) completed a double blinded randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of single versus two consecutive local corticosteroid injections. All participants were initially randomized to the single or double injection group and were advised that they would receive two injections (active/ active or active/placebo). The single injection group was not advised of the order in which they would receive the active medication for injection. All participants were first injected with 15 mg of methylprednisolone and then after eight weeks the double injection group had the same injection repeated whereas the placebo group had a similar volume of saline injected under double blind conditions. The primary outcome for the study was Global Symptom Score which was recorded at eight, 24 and 40 weeks after the second injection.</P>
<P>Sevim et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Sevim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sevim 2004</LINK>) carried out a single blinded study that attempted to compare the effectiveness of nocturnal splinting versus local corticosteroid injection. Participants with the clinical diagnosis of CTS confirmed with electrodiagnostic studies were randomized at baseline to one of three groups. The splint group (n = 60) were instructed to wear a neutral angle wrist splint at night for the duration of the study. The distal injection group (n = 30) were injected at the anterior wrist flexion crease with 3 mg betamethasone disodium phosphate and 3 mg betamethasone acetate suspension mixed with 0.5 cc of lidocaine HCL 2% solution. The proximal injection group was injected with the same medication on the volar surface of the forearm 4 cm proximal to the wrist crease. Outcome measures for this study included NCS as well as the Neurologic Symptom Score which were assessed at approximately 11 months after treatment. The investigators for this study created a control group from participants in the splinting group who did not comply with wearing of splints and dropped results for those who partially complied. This departure from intent to treat effectively neutralized any benefits of randomization initially done for the splinting group and therefore data from the splinting groups could not be used for this review.</P>
<P>Gökoglu et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Gokoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gokoglu 2005</LINK>) evaluated the effect of iontophoresis with topical corticosteroid compared to local corticosteroid injection. This unblinded randomized controlled trial included 30 participants with the clinical diagnosis of CTS confirmed by electrodiagnostic studies. The injection group received an injection of 40 mg of methylprednisolone acetate at the level of the carpal tunnel. A solution of 0.4% dexamethasone phosphate was applied over the carpal tunnel for the iontophoresis group and treatment was maintained at an amplitude of 40 to 45 mA for 20 minutes, every other day for one week. Outcomes were assessed at two and eight weeks following the start of the trial. The outcome measures included the Symptom Severity Score, the Functional Status Scale and a pain Visual Analog Scale.</P>
<P>Aygül et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Aygul-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aygul 2005</LINK>) completed an unblinded randomized controlled trial comparing local corticosteroid injection, iontophoresis and phonophoresis. Thirty-three women with the clinical diagnosis of CTS confirmed with electrodiagnostic studies were enrolled. Treatment intervention groups were local corticosteroid injection, iontophoresis or phonophoresis. Treatments lasted 10 minutes and were applied five days per week for three weeks. Local corticosteroid injection (n = 12) into the carpal tunnel involved 1 mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate without local anaesthetic. Iontophoresis (n = 10) was carried out as a single therapy with 1 to 4 mA galvanic current applied over the carpal tunnel with a pad soaked in 0.1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate covering the positive electrode. The therapy sessions lasted 10 minutes and were administered five days a week for three weeks. The phonophoresis group (n = 11) similarly received treatment at 3 MHz and intensity of 1.0 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Treatment outcomes included the Symptom Severity Score and the Functional Status Score. Electrophysiological outcomes were also reported, but, the investigators reported these as dichotomous outcomes (significant improvement) rather than mean values and standard deviations.</P>

<P>Overall, there is quite a variation in the quality of studies included in this review. A number of studies could be considered to be of good quality (Please see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) trial was scored at four out of five with the quality assessment form developed by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1994</LINK>) since, the method of randomization and concealment of treatment allocation were not adequately described. <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK> comparing oral versus local injection of corticosteroid yielded a high quality rating of five out of five. The <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2005</LINK> study scored four out of five with one point lost for not identifying the method of randomization. The initial phases of the <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK> studies scored five out of five points. However in <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK> 93% of the placebo injection group had been unblinded for the study by three months after injection. Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK> participants were unblinded after the initial treatment phase. For each of these studies, subjective clinical symptom improvement was the primary outcome. Baseline characteristics such as mean age and duration of symptoms for the control and active treatment groups were similar for each study. The spectrum of severity of CTS was alluded to in the Dammers study by the reporting of absence or presence of median sensory nerve action potentials on electrodiagnostic studies.</P>
<P>Blinding tended not to be undertaken in trials comparing alternative active treatment interventions with local corticosteroid injection therefore tending to lead to poor overall quality ratings. In <LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK> the inability to blind resulted in a quality score of three out of five. The <LINK REF="STD-Aygul-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aygul 2005</LINK> (two out of five), <LINK REF="STD-Sevim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sevim 2004</LINK> (one out of five), <LINK REF="STD-Gokoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gokoglu 2005</LINK> (one out of five), <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK> (one out of five), <LINK REF="STD-Habib-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Habib 2006</LINK> (two out of five) and <LINK REF="STD-Lucantoni-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucantoni 1992</LINK> (one out of five) studies were of even lower quality.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptom improvement one month or less after injection compared to placebo </HEADING>
<P>In one study comparing local corticosteroid injection to placebo injection, the symptom severity one month after injection was the primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) (n = 60 participants). One month following injection there was significant improvement in the local corticosteroid injection versus placebo injection group with a relative risk (RR) of 3.83 (95% CI 1.82 to 8.05). In a second study, <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK> (n = 81 participants) there was significant clinical improvement at two weeks following local injection with 1 mL of betamethasone compared to placebo injection, RR 2.04 (95% CI 1.26 to 3.31). Taken together, these studies show significantly more participants with improvement after corticosteroid injection than placebo, RR 2.58 (95% confidence intervals 1.72 to 3.87) (Analysis 01.01).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Local corticosteroid injection compared to systemic corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>Daily oral corticosteroids versus local injection were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK> (n = 60 participants). Comparison at two weeks did not demonstrate a significant difference in Global Symptom Score between local injection and oral corticosteroid. The mean difference (MD) was -4.20 (95% CI -8.66 to 0.26) (Analysis 02.01.01). However, at eight weeks and 12 weeks after treatment onset, local corticosteroid treatment was found to be significantly better than oral corticosteroid, mean difference -7.16 (95% CI -11.46 to -2.86) (Analysis 02.01.02) and -7.10 (95% CI -11.68 to -2.52) (Analysis 02.01.03) respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK> (n = 37 participants) compared local corticosteroid injection versus single systemic corticosteroid injection. The primary outcome measure was symptom severity rated on an ordinal scale.

<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK> compared local corticosteroid injection with oral anti-inflammatory drugs and neutral angle wrist splint. Clinical severity was rated using the Symptom Severity check list score as the primary outcome measure. For this study, some participants received intervention in each hand, resulting in 23 participants and '37 hands' in the study. No significant difference was found in clinical outcome two weeks, MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.64 to 0.64) (Analysis 03.01.01), or eight weeks, MD 0.10 (95% CI -0.33 to 0.53) (Analysis 03.01.02) after start of treatment.

O'Gradaigh (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK>) compared low dose (25 mg hydrocortisone) injection into the carpal tunnel versus high dose (100 mg hydrocortisone) measuring outcome at six weeks after injection. Clinical symptoms were not significantly different for either treatment group, RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.52) (Analysis 05.01.03). Although follow-up at six months was reported, the investigators only evaluated those who had responded at six weeks, therefore, these data were not used. Another study examined the effect of 15 mg versus 35 mg of methylprednisolone injected into the carpal tunnel, but a confounding factor was that both the dosage and site (proximal (higher dose) to the wrist crease versus distal (lower dose) to the wrist crease) were different (<LINK REF="STD-Habib-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Habib 2006</LINK>). No difference in subjective clinical outcome was noted at 1 week (RR not estimable), 3 weeks, RR 0.88 (95% CI (0.63 to 1.24), 6 weeks, RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.40), or 12 weeks, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.69) (Analysis 05.01.01 to 05.01.04).</P>

Clinical symptoms were not significantly different for either treatment group, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.64) (Analysis 06.01).

At 11 months after injection, there was no significant difference between groups based on the clinical Neurologic Symptom Score, WMD 2.17 (95% CI -1.07 to 5.41) (Analysis 11.01). There was also no significant differences in electrophysiological outcomes at the same time (Analyses 11.02 to 11.04). Habib et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Habib-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Habib 2006</LINK>) compared two techniques of injection with the confounding factor that both site and dosage varied between randomized groups. There was no significant difference in subjective clinical symptom outcome between injection proximal or distal to the wrist crease at 1week (RR not estimable), 3 weeks, RR 0.88 (95% CI (0.63 to 1.24) (Analysis 08.01.02), 6 weeks, RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.40) (Analysis 08.01.03), or 12 weeks, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.69) (Analysis 08.01.04).</P>

At two weeks after injection, the study by Gokoglu demonstrated a significant improvement in the Symptom Severity Score, WMD -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.02) (Analysis 07.01.01), but there was no difference in the Functional Status Score, WMD -0.60 (95% CI-1.24 to 0.04) (Analysis 07.02.01) or Visual Analog Scale score for pain, WMD -0.60 (95% CI -1.23 to 0.03) (Analysis 07.03.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Gokoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gokoglu 2005</LINK>). At eight weeks after treatment, two studies show no difference in outcome between injection and iontophoresis for the Symptom Severity Scale, WMD -0.29 (95% CI -0.63 to 0.05) (Analysis 07.01.02) and the Functional Status Score, WMD -0.28 (95% CI -0.95 to 0.39) (Analysis 07.02.02). However, the pain Visual Analog Scale demonstrates significant benefit in the injection group compared to the iontophoresis group at eight weeks, WMD -1.70 (95% CI -2.38 to -1.02) (Analysis 07.03.02). Aygul et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Aygul-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aygul 2005</LINK>) compared electrodiagnostic study results between groups at two months, RR 2.93 (95% CI 1.16 to 7.36) (Analysis 07.13.01) and four months, RR 2.52 (95% CI 1.13 to 5.60) (Analysis 07.13.02). After treatment the results showed a significant improvement in sensory conduction latency difference between digits 2 (median nerve) and 5 (ulnar nerve) at each of these times, however multiple other tests were not significant.</P>

<P>Aygul et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Aygul-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aygul 2005</LINK>) (N = 22) compared local corticosteroid injection and phonophoresis and did not demonstrate any significant differences after two months or four months between treatment groups based on the Symptom Severity Score, WMD at two months -0.30 (95% CI -0.78 to 0.18) (Analysis 09.01.01) and at four months WMD -0.40 (95% CI -0.93 to 0.13) (Analysis 09.01.02) and Functional Status Score, WMD at two months 0.00 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.31) (Analysis 09.02.01) and four months, WMD -0.17 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.19) (Analysis 09.02.02). Once again multiple comparisons between groups for electrodiagnostic studies were made. At four months after treatment, a significant difference favouring injection was found for the median/ ulnar nerve sensory amplitude ratio, RR 2.70 (95% CI 1.06 to 6.88) and the sensory latency difference between digits 2 and 5, RR 2.52 (95% CI 1.13 to 5.60) (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with placebo</HEADING>
<P>This review includes two good quality randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) that demonstrate significant symptom relief for CTS as a result of local corticosteroid injection after two weeks to four weeks, RR 2.58 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.87) compared to placebo injection. There were no adverse events reported in these trials.</P>
<P>The duration of symptom relief for CTS following local corticosteroid injection cannot be reliably commented upon beyond one month post injection. Although the study by Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) followed up patients to one year after injection, comparisons between the active and placebo groups were not possible beyond one month. At that time blinding was broken for treatment non-responders and corticosteroid injection was offered to those who had received placebo. In the open portion of the study, 50% of participants in the intervention group, one year after injection, had not required further treatment. Non-responders in the control group were given local corticosteroid injection and 24 of 28 participants had relief of symptoms. One year after injection, 12 (50%) of these subjects had not required further treatment for their CTS symptoms. A similar scenario occurred in the Armstrong study (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK>): some participants were followed up to 18 months and had repeat corticosteroid injections for recurrent symptoms. Participants who initially received placebo were offered corticosteroid injection or referral to surgery for recurrent symptoms. These results are similar to other non-controlled trials which have shown symptom relief beyond one month (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ayhan_x002d_Ardic-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayhan-Ardic 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Babu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gelberman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelberman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giannini-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manz-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manz 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matulova-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matulova 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortier 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seror-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seror 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1994</LINK>). Hayward (<LINK REF="REF-Hayward-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayward 2000</LINK>) criticised the study by Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) because it did not demonstrate that corticosteroid injection is more effective than placebo after three months. Previous trials have shown improvement after a number of months of non-surgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Destefano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Destefano 1997</LINK>). Although not included in the analysis, the studies by Wu (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1991</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Girlanda-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Girlanda 1993</LINK>) further support the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for treatment of CTS. Wu (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1991</LINK>) demonstrated electrophysiological improvement compared to controls following injection, but did not evaluate symptom improvement. Girlanda (<LINK REF="STD-Girlanda-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Girlanda 1993</LINK>) also demonstrated significant clinical improvement at one and two months after local corticosteroid injection compared to controls.</P>

In the short term, oral corticosteroids have been demonstrated to be effective in managing CTS symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hui-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hui 2001</LINK>), but it appears that the duration of effect for local corticosteroid injection is superior. However, benefit beyond the three month time frame remains unknown.</P>
<P>As identified above, the study by Dammers et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) suggests a possible long term benefit, but this is in contrast to other results such as those found by Lucantoni (<LINK REF="STD-Lucantoni-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucantoni 1992</LINK>) where benefit of corticosteroid injection compared to Helium-Neon laser is not maintained at 6 months follow-up.</P>
<P>In a unique study comparing local corticosteroid injection and single systemic/ intramuscular corticosteroid injection, benefit is demonstrated up to one month after injection for local corticosteroid injection (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparison of local corticosteroid injection to anti-inflammatory and neutral angle wrist splints confirms clinical improvement from baseline, but does not demonstrate that one treatment is superior to the other (<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK>). In this study follow-up was limited to eight weeks and the number of participants was small and the power of the study to compare what appear to be two effective treatments for CTS may have been limited.</P>
<P>Although this review focuses on comparison of local CTS injection to non-surgical interventions, it is necessary to consider local steroid injection in relation to the common intervention of surgical decompression. Ly-Pen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ly_x002d_Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly-Pen 2005</LINK>) demonstrated in a prospective, randomized open one year trial that persons receiving local corticosteroid injection had better short term outcomes and similar one year outcomes compared to surgical decompression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition of participants</HEADING>
<P>Few of the included studies provided an explicit definition of CTS such as that provided by the American Association of Neurology (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>), although except for Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) all used electrodiagnostic studies in conjunction with clinical symptoms. The clinical outcome for five of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucantoni-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucantoni 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) was also loosely defined using a subjective ordinal ranking scale. Neither the magnitude of improvement using these scales nor the changes in specific symptoms are clear. The studies by Wong (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2005</LINK>), Sevim (<LINK REF="STD-Sevim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sevim 2004</LINK>), Gokoglu (<LINK REF="STD-Gokoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gokoglu 2005</LINK>), Aygul (<LINK REF="STD-Aygul-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aygul 2005</LINK>) and Celiker (<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK>) each used validated symptom scales. The severity of CTS in the study by Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) would be considered severe for most subjects since 80% of all participants had absent sensory nerve action potentials on nerve conduction studies. The other studies did not report severity of CTS other than to indicate that findings such as thenar atrophy would lead to exclusion from the study. Participants in each of the studies by Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>) and Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) had had symptoms for a mean of between two to four years. The average duration of symptoms for the study by Celiker (<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK>) was between six to nine months. The duration of symptoms were not reported by Wong or Lucantoni. Therefore, it remains unclear as to which population, based on severity and duration of symptoms, is most responsive to local corticosteroid injection. Gelberman (<LINK REF="REF-Gelberman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelberman 1980</LINK>), in a prospective trial of corticosteroid injection, identified that participants with milder CTS severity (based on both symptoms and nerve conduction studies) had more symptomatic relief and duration of effectiveness of treatment compared to persons with severe CTS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Different types, routes and doses</HEADING>
<P>Although the included studies each used different injection techniques and dosages, no particular dosage or type of medication provided a clearly superior outcome. The lowest dosage and relative potency used for injection in the studies reviewed was 15 mg of prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK>) compared to 40 mg of methylprednisolone used in other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Celiker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Celiker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucantoni-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucantoni 1992</LINK>) and there was still benefit identified at this lower dosage three months after injection when compared to oral corticosteroid. The fact that the studies of Dammers (<LINK REF="STD-Dammers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dammers 1999</LINK>), Ozdogan (<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 1984</LINK>) and Wong (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK>) showed a significant benefit compared to control interventions, despite differences in type and potency of injectable corticosteroids, patient populations and settings, lends support to the generalizability of these results for treatment of CTS. Sevim et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sevim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sevim 2004</LINK>) compared distal versus proximal local corticosteroid injection of the carpal tunnel and found no significant difference in outcome. However, an important limitation of this study was the prolonged period of time between injection and outcome assessment at approximately 11 months, where as noted above there is controversy with regards to the expected duration of benefit. Two low quality studies (<LINK REF="STD-Habib-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Habib 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK>) did not show benefit of higher dosage versus lower dosage of corticosteroid injection. Similarly O'Gradaigh (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Gradaigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Gradaigh 2000</LINK>) did not show any benefit of longer acting corticosteroids over shorter duration corticosteroids for injection. Similar to this finding is the high quality study provided by Wong et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2005</LINK>) that did not demonstrate significant clinical improvement following two injections of local corticosteroid compared to just one injection.</P>
<P>Two important characteristics of an intervention include adverse outcomes associated with the intervention as well as the cost effectiveness of the intervention. These elements were not specifically examined for this review, but will be included in future updates.<U>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Local corticosteroid injection for severe CTS provides symptomatic benefit at one month compared to placebo. The duration of benefit and the effect on mild and moderate CTS are not known, but the effects appear to be time limited and benefit beyond one month remains uncertain. Local corticosteroid injection provides more improvement in symptoms than oral corticosteroid for up to three months. Compared to a single systemic injection, local corticosteroid injection provides clinical improvement in symptoms at one month. The symptom improvement with local corticosteroid is not significantly different from anti-inflammatory medication and neutral angle wrist splinting at eight weeks after onset of treatment. Two injections of corticosteroid into the carpal tunnel do not provide further clinical benefit compared to one injection. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research is required to determine the duration of benefit from local corticosteroid injection and to identify candidates for treatment based on severity and duration of symptoms. Local corticosteroid injection should also be compared to, and combined with, other non-surgical and even surgical interventions to determine the optimum management of CTS. </P>

<P>Blinded, randomized, controlled trial studying non-surgical intervention in CTS including local carpal tunnel corticosteroid injection, wrist splinting, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and combined therapy. The study was excluded since a clinical outcome measure was not used and only peripheral nerve conduction studies were used as an outcome measure. The authors comment that other studies have relied on subjective patient report for effectiveness of intervention and that in this study the results are wholly based on objective electrophysiologic measures.</P>

<P>Sender: Hans Dammers<BR/>Contact: hans.dammers@hetnet.nl <BR/>Date: 17 February 2002</P>
<P>The authors of the BMJ study on local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome (Dammers 1999) have read your review and are disappointed. The review states that 'symptom relief beyond one month compared to placebo has not been demonstrated'. In the 'Discussion' you mention that blinding was broken in the placebo group after one month. For the greater part of the placebo group this was true, only because the protocol ordered it because an endpoint was scored blindly. Only after all the information was gathered and decisions had been made was blinding broken. Twenty four patients did not experience benefit, six did have a benefit, but after three months in four patients complaints returned. Only in these cases was blinding broken. The authors of this review and Hayward (Hayward 2000) in his comment on our paper expected more spontaneous recoveries, but our patients had an average duration of carpal tunnel syndrome of twenty four months. It would be naive to expect spontaneous recoveries after such a long time and it is probably not ethical as well to keep patients off treatment for any longer. Fifty per cent of the patients in the treatment group as well as 50% of the non -responders in the placebo group which received the same dose of methylprednisolone had a benefit when followed for a year. </P>
<P>We have just finished a second study where patients could make a choice for surgery or a second injection, after the effect of the first injection was gone. After two injections, only 24.6% asked for surgery after 12 months.</P>
<P>We regret you have made a mistake by stating that the effect of an injection close to the carpal tunnel only provides improvement for one month. The authors of this study are eager to hear your comments.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Date: May 14 2002</P>
<P>We are responding to the comment provided by H. Dammers with regards to our Systematic Review entitled 'Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome' (Marshall 2000).</P>
<P>Dr Hans Dammers, the principle author of the paper entitled 'Injection with methylprednisolone proximal to the carpal tunnel: randomized double blind trial' (Dammers 1999) disagrees with the conclusions reached in our systematic review specifically with regards to interpretation of their manuscript. </P>
<P>Dammers et al. admit that for the placebo group the blinding was 'broken for the greater part' at one month post injection (this represents 80% of the group). By 3 months follow-up 93% (28 out of 30) of the placebo group was unblinded. We agree that this study clearly demonstrates after one month that local corticosteroid injection is effective for CTS. However, we do not agree that this study provides good evidence of benefit beyond this point. First of all, this study is contrary to most studies that suggest benefit of local corticosteroid injection is of limited duration (Girlanda 1993; Giannini 1991; Gelberman 1980; Weiss 1994). For this study, at one month 50% of (total) patients had been unblinded whereas 65% of patients had been unblinded at 3 months, and bias was likely to have been high for two reasons. First, the investigators would likely have realized that most patients receiving placebo injection had not responded and had proceeded to a second active injection. Second, local corticosteroid has limited expected duration and spontaneous recovery (addressed below) does often occur for CTS. Given this, with 80% of the placebo group removed from follow-up in this study, no meaningful comparison was possible beyond one month for the effect of local corticosteroid injection.</P>
<P>We also suggest that this study had further bias in that the two groups, active and placebo were treated differently. The placebo group was offered local injection with methylprednisolone after blinding was broken whereas the patients in the intervention group were offered surgery directly. Based on the comment that 'it is probably not ethical to keep patients off treatment any longer', we would question the clinical equipoise on which this study was based. If the authors believed that local corticosteroid injection was truly beneficial and they were concerned after one month that treatment was being withheld, why would another treatment not have been offered in conjunction with or instead of placebo injection? By the study design offering differential management to the placebo versus control group, the authors suggest that they are "certain" that local steroid injection is effective. For the follow-up of patients beyond one month post injection we believe that the information presented by Dammers et al. is essentially equivalent to an open label, non-randomized study. Beyond one month, the majority of placebo injection patients are openly treated and the active treatment group was likely to have been suspected on the part of the examiners therefore bias potential at this point was very high. </P>
<P>With regards to the comment that 'it would be naïve to expect spontaneous recoveries after such a long time' again we do not necessarily agree. Although the authors indicate that the average duration of symptoms for patients was 25 months in the placebo group, in their protocol they accepted patients with symptoms of greater than 3 months and we are unable to get a good sense of the duration of symptoms since standard deviations were not provided. Further, when the paper by Dammers et al. was written in 1999, Futami et al . had previously published a paper in 1997 (Futami 1997) suggesting that 34% of CTS cases have spontaneous complete resolution of symptoms and that this generally occurs over a five month time frame. More recently, Padua et al (Padua 2001) have completed a multicentred Italian based study that followed untreated carpal tunnel syndrome. These authors found that for patients with severe and moderate CTS there was spontaneous improvement in symptoms of 49% and 31% respectively.</P>
<P>We are unable to comment with regards to the findings of the second study by Dammers et al. that is referred to in the criticism since we have not reviewed the manuscript.</P>
<P>Although we believe that Dammers et al. have provided very good evidence for effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for CTS up to one month post injection, for the above stated reasons, we do not believe that these results provide good evidence for effect beyond 1 month.</P>
