<TITLE>Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-01 15:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>An aneurysm is a localised widening (dilation) of an artery. The blood vessel can burst (rupture) because the vessel wall is weakened. Some 5% to 10% of men aged between 65 and 79 years have an abdominal aneurysm in the area of the aorta, the main artery from the heart as it passes through the abdomen. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often asymptomatic but a rupture is a surgical emergency and often leads to death. An aneurysm larger than 5 cm carries a high risk of rupture. Smaller aneurysms are monitored regularly using ultrasound to see if they are becoming larger. Elective surgical repair of aortic aneurysms aims to prevent death from rupture. The incidence of aortic aneurysm in women as they age is lower than for men.</P>
<P>This review identified four controlled trials involving 127,891 men and 9342 women who were randomly assigned to aortic aneurysm screening using ultrasound or no screening. Only one trial included women. Two of the trials were conducted in the UK, one in Denmark and one in Australia. The results provide evidence of a benefit from screening in men with a strongly significant reduction in deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysm. The odds ratio (OR) for death was 0.60 (range 0.47 to 0.78, three trials) in men aged 65 to 83 years but was not reduced for women. From one trial there was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men but not women.</P>
<P>All-cause mortality was not significantly different between screened and unscreened groups some three to five years after screening, which is to be expected given the relative infrequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a cause of death.</P>
<P>Men who had been screened underwent more surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR 2.03; range 1.59 to 2.59, four trials) but resource analysis appears to demonstrate overall cost effectiveness of screening. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or quality of life.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-09-01 15:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is found in 5% to 10% of men aged 65 to 79 years. The major complication is rupture which presents as a surgical emergency. The mortality after rupture is high, 80% for patients reaching hospital and 50% for those undergoing surgery for emergency repair. Currently elective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms discovered to be larger than 5.5 cm to prevent rupture. There is interest in population screening to detect, monitor and repair abdominal aortic aneurysms before rupture.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of screening asymptomatic individuals for AAA on mortality, subsequent treatment, quality of life and cost effectiveness of screening.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of population screening for AAA.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-01 15:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Four studies involving 127,891 men and 9342 women were included in this review. Only one study included women.</P>
<P>Results for men and women were analysed separately. Three to five years after screening there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between screened and unscreened groups for men or women (men, odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.07; for women OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21).</P>
<P>There was a significant decrease in mortality from AAA in men (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78), but not for women (OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.36 to 10.88). In this analysis mortality includes death from rupture and from emergency or elective surgery for aneurysm repair. There was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.99) but not in women (OR 1.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 8.94).</P>
<P>There was a significant increase in surgery for AAA in men (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.59 to 2.59). This was not reported in women. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or subjective quality of life.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence of a significant reduction in mortality from AAA in men aged 65 to 79 years who undergo ultrasound screening. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit in women. The cost effectiveness may be acceptable, but needs further expert analysis. These findings need careful consideration in judging whether a co-ordinated population-based screening programme should be introduced.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-01 15:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a dilatation of the aorta (the main artery from the heart) as it passes through the abdomen. It is present in 5% to 10% of men aged between 65 and 79 years and is often asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Vardulaki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardulaki 1999</LINK>). The major complication is rupture which presents as a surgical emergency. The mortality after rupture is high - approximately 80% of those who reach hospital and 50% of those undergoing emergency surgery for ruptured aortic aneurysm will die (<LINK REF="REF-Basnyat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basnyat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1994</LINK>). Elective surgical repair of aortic aneurysms aims to prevent death from rupture and the 30-day operative mortality for open surgery<B> </B>is approximately 5% to 6% (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1998</LINK>). <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The likelihood of rupture depends on the size of the aneurysm. In the five years following diagnosis rupture occurs in approximately 2% of aneurysms found to be less than 4 cm in diameter and in over 25% of aneurysms larger than 5 cm (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1993</LINK>). On this basis currently accepted practice for identified aneurysms is the following (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1999</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>elective surgical repair for large aneurysms, usually taken to be 5.5 cm diameter or larger;</LI>
<LI>regular (e.g. six monthly) ultrasound surveillance for aneurysms below 5.5 cm diameter, with referral for surgery if the aneurysm grows at &gt;1.0 cm per year or reaches 5.5 cm.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Ultrasound screening for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm has been identified as a possible means of reducing mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Wilmink-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilmink 1998</LINK>) in view of the greatly reduced mortality after elective repair compared to that following rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1994</LINK>). However, screening is controversial for several reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>people with large aneurysms do not necessarily die from them;</LI>
<LI>the balance between risk of rupture and risk of elective surgical repair (which still has a significant mortality) is difficult to judge for people who are healthy, as opposed to people who already have symptoms of an aneurysm;</LI>
<LI>many healthy people will have a small aneurysm identified for which surgery is not advisable, but their awareness of their aneurysm could lead to significant anxiety.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Screening programmes should meet a standard set of criteria before their introduction. In the United Kingdom they are not introduced unless approved by the National Screening Committee. Approval requires programmes to meet criteria including evidence from high quality randomised controlled trials that they are effective in reducing mortality or morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Dept-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Dept 1998</LINK>). Whilst the National Screening Committee had considered that there was insufficient evidence on which to recommend introduction of a population screening programme (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Dept-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Dept 2000</LINK>), they now consider that the evidence is sufficient to introduce screening, but its introduction should be through managed development of a co-ordinated service (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Dept-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Dept 2006</LINK>). There are, however, no published systematic reviews of the evidence for screening from randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>All randomised controlled trials of screening versus no screening were eligible for this review. Any method of randomisation was eligible, including those in which individuals, locations or practices had been randomised. We planned that differences in trial quality would be taken into account in the analysis. Trials were to be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, but others would be included provided all randomised patients were accounted for.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials including people asymptomatic of aortic aneurysm were eligible for this review. Trials could be from any population, but major differences in the populations studied were to be considered in the analysis. For example, trials in the general population and in people with peripheral vascular disease were eligible, with differences in outcome to be identified in the analysis. The age-specific incidence of aortic aneurysm is lower in women than men, although the annual rate of rupture is higher (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>). This may alter the cost effectiveness of screening between men and women. Trials including both sexes were eligible and were analysed together, but sex differences in the outcome of screening were identified in the analysis.<BR/> </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies of any screening technique for abdominal aortic aneurysm were eligible, although it was anticipated that trials would focus on ultrasound methods. It was planned that different screening techniques would be accounted for in the analysis to take account of different levels of sensitivity and specificity. Trials of screening followed by treatment and of screening alone were also to be included, provided long term outcome measures were identified.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four completed randomised controlled studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. These were conducted in Chichester, UK (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>), Viborg, Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK>), Perth, Western Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Western-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Western Australia</LINK>), and an MRC trial in the UK (Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study) (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Chichester trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>) identified 15,775 men and women aged 65 to 80 years from family practices in Chichester, UK and randomly allocated them to ultrasound screening or no intervention. Those in whom an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4.4 cm was identified were rescanned annually, and those with an aneurysm of 4.5 cm to 5.9 cm were rescanned every three months. In both these groups surgery was offered if the rate of growth was greater than 1 cm per year or if symptoms developed. Those with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6 cm or larger were offered surgery directly. The mean follow up was 30.5 months.</P>
<P>The Mass study (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>) included 67,800 men aged 65 to 74 years from family practices in Oxford, Portsmouth, Winchester and Southampton, UK, and randomly allocated them to ultrasound screening or no intervention. Those in whom an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4.4 cm was identified were rescanned annually, and those with an aneurysm of 4.4 cm to 5.4 cm were rescanned every three months. Growth of an aneurysm of greater than 1 cm per year, or development of symptoms led to referral for surgery. Surgery was also offered directly for people with aneurysms of 5.5 cm or larger. Mean follow up was 4.1 years. The MASS study also collected data on costs associated with screening and subsequent interventions to derive estimates of cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>The Western Australian Study (<LINK REF="STD-Western-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Western Australia</LINK>) included 41,000 men aged 65 to 79 years identified from the electoral roll in Perth, Australia. They were randomly allocated to receive ultrasound screening or no intervention. Screening took place over the subsequent 32 months, and the age of men on screening therefore ranged from 65 to 83 years. Men were provided with a letter detailing the outcome of screening with a copy for their general practitioner, who arranged follow-up investigations or surgical referral as they considered appropriate. Median follow up was 43 months.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK> trial included 12,658 men aged 65 to 73 years, identified from the health department as residents of the County of Viborg, Denmark. They were randomly allocated to ultrasound screening or no intervention. Patients identified with aneurysms above 3.0 cm were offered annual rescreening, and surgery was offered when an aneurysm was 5.0 cm or larger. Mean follow up was 5.1 years. The Viborg study also collected data on hospital costs associated with screening and subsequent interventions to derive estimates of cost effectiveness.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-01 15:37:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>All four trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. In the Chichester trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>) all eligible individuals were identified from practice registers and family health service lists, and randomisation was generated by computer. The same method was used by the Mass study (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>). The Western Australia trial (<LINK REF="STD-Western-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Western Australia</LINK>) identified individuals from the electoral role, excluding those living in nursing homes, and those who lived in a community too far distant for the researchers to establish a screening clinic within their resources. The remainder were randomised by computer-generated random numbering (<LINK REF="REF-Jamrozik-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamrozik 2000</LINK>), into intervention and control groups of equal size defined by five year age group and postcode. The Viborg trial (<LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK>) identified all eligible men in the County of Viborg from health department lists. Randomisation was computer generated in blocks of of approximately 1000 in order to avoid too long a time between randomisation and invitation to screening (<LINK REF="REF-Lindholt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholt 2002</LINK>). Due to the nature of the intervention, patients were not blinded to the intervention in any of the studies. All four studies analysed results on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>Three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Western-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Western Australia</LINK>) sought information on deaths from all causes and from abdominal aortic aneurysm in the general population. The Western Australia trial randomised all men at the same time, but screening took place over a 32-month period for logistical reasons. Men were therefore not invited for screening until some months after randomisation. As a result, 2296 men died after randomisation but before the date of screening (screening group), or the equivalent "virtual" date of screening (control group). The virtual date of screening was the median scheduled date of examination for men from the same post code area randomised to be screened. Two sets of analyses were undertaken, one from the point of randomisation, and one from the point of invitation to screening. For the purpose of this review, analyses undertaken from the point of screening are included in the results, and the possible impact of analyses from the point of randomisation discussed.</P>
<P>The Viborg trial (<LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK>) only identified deaths within hospital, and not deaths occurring in the community. Hence mortality could not be compared with the other trials. All four trials identified rates of surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm as an outcome, and the Chichester trial identified incidence of ruptured aortic aneurysm (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup of people with aneurysms between 3.0 cm and 4.9 cm identified in the Viborg trial was also invited to participate in a randomised double blind trial of the impact of propranolol versus placebo on the expansion rate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (<LINK REF="STD-Lindholt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindholt 1999</LINK>). This trial was stopped after two years because the propranolol group suffered significantly higher rates of dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), decreased pulmonary function and death. Although only 30 of 122 patients identified as having a small abdominal aortic aneurysm were treated with propranolol, this could significantly alter the death rates in the screened group. This is a further reason for not comparing mortality in the Viborg study with the other trials.</P>
<P>In addition, 92 patients identified as having small aneurysms 2.5 cm to 2.9 cm were included in a trial of a macrolide antibiotic to decrease expansion. This had a small but significant effect decreasing the rate of expansion (<LINK REF="STD-Vammen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vammen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality of cost effectiveness analyses was not assessed by the authors.</P>

<P>The impact of screening on overall mortality is reported in the Chichester trial (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>), the MASS study (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>) and the Western Australia trial (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2004</LINK>). Individually the Chichester and MASS trials do not identify an impact on overall mortality (Chichester, men: odds ratio (OR) 1.07; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 0.93 to 1.22; Chichester, women: OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; MASS, men: OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02). The Western Australia trial only reports all-cause mortality in its analysis from the point of screening and not from the point of randomisation. This identifies a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.90). When all studies in men reporting all-cause mortality are analysed together, there is no significant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07). <B>Comparison 01/01</B>

This includes deaths due to rupture and deaths associated with emergency and elective surgery for aneurysm repair. In men, the Chichester and Western Australia trials show a non-significant reduction (Chichester, OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.29 and Western Australia, OR 0.72; CI 0.39 to 1.32). The MASS study, however, demonstrated a strongly significant reduction (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.78). The results of the Chichester trial in women show no benefit (OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.36 to 10.88).

<P>The Western Australia trial also presents data on mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm analysed from the point of randomisation rather than from the point of screening.

<P>The MASS study (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>) has published a full cost effectiveness analysis of the benefits of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening at four years follow up, with projection of their data to estimate cost effectiveness at ten years. They identified 47 fewer deaths over four years due to abdominal aortic aneurysm, at an additional cost of £2.2 million. This equated to £28,400 per life year gained, and approximately £36,000 per QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year). After ten years this is estimated to fall to about £8,000 per life year gained.</P>
<P>The Viborg trial (<LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK>) identifies outline hospital costs with an estimate of costs outside hospital. They derive a figure of DKK 7540 per life year saved (£1 = 12 DKK).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identifies four randomised controlled trials of aortic aneurysm screening, and the results appear to identify evidence of significant benefit in men. Analysing data from the trials together shows a strongly significant reduction in mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is a highly significant increase in rates of surgery resulting from screening, but resource analysis appears to demonstrate overall cost effectiveness. </P>
<P>There are, however, a number of uncertainties in this review. Firstly, the study shows no significant impact on all-cause mortality, which is to be expected given the relative infrequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a cause of death. However, there is significant heterogeneity, with the Western Australia study showing a significant decrease in all-cause mortality. This study identified seven fewer deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysm in the screened group compared with controls, but there were 339 fewer deaths from all causes. This suggests that the reduction in overall mortality in this study may not be a genuine impact of screening. Instead, this may be related to the study design in which randomisation took place at the outset, but individuals were invited to screening over a 32 month period, in which 2296 of the intervention and control groups had died. The subsequent analysis of all-cause mortality took the point of screening rather than randomisation as the starting point, and this may have introduced an unrecognised bias in the design of this particular study</P>
<P>The second area of uncertainty is the cost effectiveness of screening. The results of the MASS and Viborg trials are very different, with a cost of £28,400 (<LINK REF="STD-MASS" TYPE="STUDY">MASS</LINK>) per life year saved compared with DKK 7540 (<LINK REF="STD-Viborg" TYPE="STUDY">Viborg</LINK>). The authors did not assess the methodological quality of cost effectiveness calculations, but even the MASS study, demonstrating higher costs, gives a result at the margins of acceptable cost effectiveness. Projecting figures to ten years gives a considerably lower estimate of cost per life year saved. It is not possible from this analysis to be certain of the cost effectiveness of screening, but the published figures do suggest that cost effectiveness may be acceptable.</P>
<P>Thirdly is the paucity of information about the costs and benefits of screening in women. Only the Chichester study included women, and there were insufficient numbers to produce any meaningful results (<LINK REF="STD-Chichester" TYPE="STUDY">Chichester</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite these uncertainties, there are now data on trials including over 122,000 men, using a similar method of screening, and approximately similar regimes for follow up and intervention. Uptake rates are high in all studies, and taken together they appear to demonstrate an overall benefit from ultrasound screening in men aged 65 to 79 years, in terms of reduced mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is also a suggestion that cost effectiveness may be acceptable. It is still the case, however, that even though the overall population benefit from screening appears to be established, there will still be a significant rate of mortality and morbidity from elective aneurysm repair in people who otherwise considered themselves healthy, and whose aneurysms detected by screening may not have ruptured in future. The mortality associated with elective surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, though far lower than that following rupture, is not insignificant. Patients may therefore be asked to undergo this risk to repair a large aneurysm which may not kill them. Conversely others will discover they have small aneurysms not yet needing surgery, but which could nonetheless expand and kill them in the future. There are limited data in these four trials on quality of life, surgical complications or overall life expectancy to further aid the analysis. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence from this study of a significant reduction in mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm in men aged 65 to 79 years who undergo ultrasound screening. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit in women. The cost effectiveness may be acceptable, but needs further expert analysis. These findings need careful consideration in judging whether a co-ordinated population based screening programme should be introduced. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The most significant gap in the current research is the balance of benefits and harms in women. This should be a focus for any future research, and further work on the feasibility of implementation would also be helpful. This might include the most acceptable method of invitation to screening, ease and logistics of access to initial ultrasound and follow up, costs and workforce needs, and how to provide information on potential benefits and harms for individuals who are offered screening. The psychological effects of screening both on patients and their partners need detailed study. There is also the question of how far and how fast any positive effects of screening can be generalised outside of centres which have developed a special expertise in operating them over many years. </P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The authors claim that the randomisation method is not described in The Viborg Trial, and that it is based on AAA deaths on hospitals. In addition, data on overall mortality is not included. This is true for the earliest publications, but the paper from BMJ in 2005 actually describes the randomisation method in blocks of approx. 1000 in order to avoid too long time between randomisation and invitation to screening, population based AAA mortality (AAA related deaths in and outside hospitals) on a national basis, and overall mortality on a national basis. These data ought to be used in the next update, which already seem needed after the publication of seven year results from the MASS trial.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>1. The author has amended the sentence in the 'Methodological quality of studies' section to state the method of randomisation. <BR/>2. The author is currently updating the review to include the seven year results of the MASS trial.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 12:59:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Aneurysm seldom occurs in those who have not smoked. The cohorts of men in these studies come largely from an era when the majority smoked. However, now many are coming through who did not smoke significantly. Thus the conclusion that all men should be screened at age 65 may become less useful. Is non-smokers' rate of aneurysm high enough to bother screening? Is it possible to conduct analyses of these trials to assess non-smokers versus smokers?<BR/>

<P>The authors have written a review showing no evidence that AAA screening prolongs survival, in either men or women. There may be evidence that screening alters how patients die, but the overall death rate does not differ between the two groups (screened and unscreened). The Abstract and Plain Language Summary mislead the reader: the PLS does not mention that screening failed to save lives; the Abstract fails in its conclusion to clarify that AAA screening does not save lives.</P>

<P>From the sex and gender perspective, the reporting is not well organized and even may be misleading. In the first line of their discussion, the authors state that 'the results appear to identify evidence of significant benefit in men.'  The statistically insignificant results for women are not explicitly noted until much later in the discussion; the authors note that one of the uncertainties in the review is the limited information available on the benefits and harms of screening for women ('insufficient numbers to produce any meaningful results').  However, the authors then contradict this limitation and state that 'the overall population benefit from screening appears to be established'.  They reverse this position again in their conclusions, in which they report that 'there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit in women', and that 'the most significant gap in the current research is the balance of benefits and harms in women'; they recommend that research in women should be a future focus.<BR/>
