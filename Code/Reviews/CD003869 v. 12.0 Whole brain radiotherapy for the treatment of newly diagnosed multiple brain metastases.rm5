The title has been amended to: "Whole brain radiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple brain metastases". The descriptor 'newly diagnosed' was added to clarify that the review deals only with upfront management rather than management at relapse. The literature search was updated in July 2011. Nine new trials involving 1420 participants were added. This updated review now includes a total of 39 trials involving 10,835 participants. Statistical analyses have been revised, and hazard ratios (rather than odds ratios) provided for the outcomes of overall survival, local control, and distant brain control. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were recalculated with formal statistical input for the outcomes of neurological function improvement and brain tumour response. In terms of implications for practice, the option of radiosurgery alone (without whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)) for selected patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases has been added.</P></DESCRIPTION></WHATS_NEW_ENTRY></HISTORY><SOURCES_OF_SUPPORT MODIFIED="2011-12-20 21:20:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><INTERNAL_SOURCES MODIFIED="2011-12-20 21:20:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SOURCE MODIFIED="2011-12-20 21:20:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><NAME>University of Toronto, Odette Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON</NAME><COUNTRY CODE="CA">Canada</COUNTRY><DESCRIPTION/></SOURCE></INTERNAL_SOURCES><EXTERNAL_SOURCES><SOURCE><NAME>Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence-based Care's Supportive Care Guidelines Group and Neuro-oncology Disease Site Group</NAME><COUNTRY CODE="CA">Canada</COUNTRY><DESCRIPTION/></SOURCE></EXTERNAL_SOURCES></SOURCES_OF_SUPPORT><MESH_TERMS VERIFIED="NO"/><KEYWORDS/></COVER_SHEET><MAIN_TEXT MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:46:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><SUMMARY MODIFIED="2018-01-13 12:26:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><TITLE MODIFIED="2017-10-25 20:35:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Whole brain radiotherapy for the treatment of multiple brain metastases</TITLE><SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-13 12:26:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P><B>The issue</B><BR/>A large proportion of people with cancer will receive a diagnosis of the spread of cancer (metastases) to the brain.

It is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with cancer will develop metastatic cancer to the brain during the course of their illness (<LINK REF="REF-Loeffler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeffler 1997</LINK>). The burden of brain metastases impacts quality and length of survival. Presenting symptoms include headache (49%), focal weakness (30%), mental disturbances (32%), gait ataxia (21%), seizures (18%), speech difficulty (12%), visual disturbance (6%), sensory disturbance (6%), and limb ataxia (6%) (<LINK REF="REF-Posner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posner 1995</LINK>).</P><P>Brain metastases may spread from any primary site. The most common primary site is the lung, followed by the breast, then gastrointestinal sites (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1985</LINK>).

It is unclear whether groups in these older trials were balanced for these prognostic variables.</P><P>In addition, results of these RCTs may not be applicable to certain subgroups of patients with brain metastases (e.g. based on molecular tumour subtypes, or the Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment), as trials evaluated heterogeneous patients with brain metastases. Most participants in these studies had lung, breast, or colorectal cancer primaries. Participants with small-cell lung cancer, germ cell tumours, and haematological malignancies were often excluded from trials.</P><P>Many of these trials lacked quality of life outcomes, neurocognitive outcomes, and information regarding the proportion of participants in each group who were able to reduce steroid dose. In cases in which overall survival was similar among trial groups, palliative endpoints such as quality of life, neurocognition, and steroid use are important.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-13 13:45:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Evidence ranged from moderate to high certainty.

Older trials are also limited by the lack of neurocognitive outcomes, which have become increasingly important in later trials examining radiosurgery and neurocognitive protective strategies.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-12 17:44:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Findings of this meta-analysis are consistent with those of other published meta-analyses examining interventions using WBRT (<LINK REF="REF-Patil-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patil 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsao-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsao 2012a</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-13 12:32:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-12 17:46:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>This updated review did not result in changes to original conclusions or new implications for practice.</P><P>None of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with altered higher biological whole body radiation therapy (WBRT) dose-fractionation schemes reported benefit in terms of overall survival, neurological function, or symptom control compared with standard treatment (3000 cGy in 10 daily fractions, or 2000 cGy in 4 or 5 daily fractions). However, survival and neurological function improvement (NFI) were worse for lower biological WBRT dose-fractionation schemes as compared with standard fractionation.The addition of WBRT to radiosurgery improves local and distant brain control but is associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes and no differences in overall survival. Among selected people with multiple brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer, data show that no differences in overall survival may occur when optimal supportive care is undertaken with omission of WBRT.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-13 12:32:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Future trials should examine homogeneous patients with brain metastases by using the Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment and molecular markers. Investigators should elucidate the optimal number or volume of brain metastases best suited for radiosurgery as compared with WBRT for outcomes of neurocognitive function, quality of life, and survival. With the aim of ameliorating the neurocognitive side effects of WBRT, further trials must evaluate use of neurocognitive protective agents and hippocampal sparing WBRT. Use of radiosensitisers, chemotherapy, or molecular targeted agents in conjunction with WBRT remains experimental.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:46:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>The review authors thank Dr. A Ohlsson for his guidance in developing and reviewing the original Cochrane Review.
