<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of care interventions for adults with epilepsy is still unclear.</P>
<P>This review compared the effectiveness of a range of interventions, including specialist nurses and management strategies, in improving outcomes for adults with epilepsy. We identified seven distinct intervention types, with varying amounts of evidence to support them. While included studies did show some benefit from specialist epilepsy nurses and self management education, other intervention types lack evidence of effectiveness. This is compounded by the poor quality methods of some studies and by the complex nature of the interventions, whose impact may vary according to where they take place. Based on this evidence, it is not possible to advocate any specific intervention type in the care of adults with epilepsy.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-10-29 08:58:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (9 December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2013), EMBASE (1988 to June 2013), PsycINFO (1887 to December 2013) and CINAHL (1937 to December 2013). In addition, we contacted experts in the field to seek information on unpublished and ongoing studies, checked the websites of epilepsy organisations and checked the reference lists of included studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-29 08:58:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review included 18 different studies of 16 separate interventions, which we classified into seven distinct groups. Most of the studies have methodological weaknesses, and many results from other analyses within studies need to be interpreted with caution because of study limitations. Consequently, there is currently limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to improve the health and quality of life in people with epilepsy. It was not possible to combine study results in a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of outcomes, study populations, interventions and time scales across the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-29 08:58:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two intervention types, the specialist epilepsy nurse and self management education, have some evidence of benefit. However, we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. It is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not apply to other settings. These studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. At present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Epilepsy is spectrum of disorders in which an individual may experience seizures that are unpredictable in frequency (<LINK REF="REF-England-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2012</LINK>). Researchers have identified at least 40 different seizure types (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>). While most people can control seizures well with medications and other treatment options, epilepsy can pose challenges to autonomy and in social, school and work situations. Not only do people with seizures tend to have more physical problems (ranging from fractures and bruising to&#8212;rarely&#8212;an increased risk of sudden death) but people with epilepsy face significant challenges in how others perceive (or misperceive) their condition, which can lead to the stigmatisation of people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bandstra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandstra 2008</LINK>). As a result, they may experience a lack of social support, social isolation, embarrassment, fear and discrimination (<LINK REF="REF-England-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2012</LINK>). Epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide, with around 80% of all cases in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Epilepsy is most common in children and older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The self management of epilepsy refers to a wide range of health behaviours and activities that an individual can learn and adapt in order to promote seizure control and enhance well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1997</LINK>). Self management of any condition typically entails a partnership between users and service providers (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>). Various dedicated models of service provision exist to improve care networks and self education (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>). Services may include specialist epilepsy outpatient clinics, nurse-based liaison services between primary (GP) and secondary/tertiary (hospital-based) care and specialist epilepsy multidisciplinary community teams (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>). Services may also include input from social care or the voluntary sector (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>) and target specific groups, such as people with learning disabilities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>Specialist or dedicated models of care, care networks, or self education and self management may improve the quality of care, promote more systematic multidisciplinary follow-up of individuals and enhance communication among professionals, patients and other services (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>). Importantly, care should enable people with epilepsy to cope with all aspects of the disease through improved self education and self management skills (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Different researchers have criticised epilepsy care as having limited impact by not fully addressing all the health and social needs of people suffering from it (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chappell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thapar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thapar 1996</LINK>). In order to improve the quality of care for adults with epilepsy, the aim of this review is to systematically update the evidence from studies investigating the effectiveness of these service models compared to non-specialist services. This systematic review is an update of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2008</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Self management education</HEADING>
<P>Four trials evaluated the effect of self management education in adults with epilepsy (<LINK REF="STD-Aliasgharpour-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aliasgharpour 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-May-2002" TYPE="STUDY">May 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK> recruited participants from among those insured by Kaiser Permanente in California. <LINK REF="STD-May-2002" TYPE="STUDY">May 2002</LINK> took place in 22 epilepsy centres across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. <LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2011</LINK> was an online epilepsy self management programme to assist people with taking medication, managing stress and improving sleep quality in Atlanta, USA. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Aliasgharpour-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aliasgharpour 2013</LINK> evaluated an educational programme to improve self management in Zanjan, Iran.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK> evaluated a two-day psycho-educational treatment programme (Sepulveda Epilepsy Education, also known as the Seizures and Epilepsy Education programme, or SEE) in 38 adults with epilepsy who were also prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Participants were randomly assigned to either the SEE programme (n = 20) or to a waiting list control group (n = 23). Participants completed questionnaires before the programme and four months after completion. Investigators then invited waiting list control group members to attend the programme at four months. Questionnaires included questions about anxiety and depression, seizures, coping with epilepsy and self efficacy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-May-2002" TYPE="STUDY">May 2002</LINK> evaluated a two-day educational programme (the Modular Service Package Epilepsy, or MOSES) in adults with epilepsy. Two hundred forty-two participants were randomly assigned to the MOSES programme (n = 113) or to a waiting list control group (n = 129). Participants completed questionnaires before the programme and six months after completion of the programme. Investigators then invited waiting list control group members to attend the MOSES programme at six months. Questionnaires included measures of knowledge, coping with epilepsy, seizure frequency, contentedness with AED therapy, depressive mood and an evaluation of MOSES.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2011</LINK> evaluated a six-week WebEase programme, in 192 participants who voluntarily enrolled to participate after obtaining information about the study, either from healthcare professionals, online clinical research matching services, family, friends or online epilepsy and research sites. Following completion of a baseline assessment, only the first participant who enrolled to the programme was randomly assigned. Thereafter participants were allocated alternatively to either the intervention (WebEase) (n = 96) or a waiting list control group (n = 96). After six weeks (when the intervention group had completed WebEase), those in the waiting list control began the programme as well. Participants completed three questionnaire assessments, at baseline, 6 weeks (when only the intervention group had completed WebEase), and 12 weeks (when both groups had completed WebEase). At each assessment, investigators assessed measures of medication adherence, stress, sleep quality, self management, self efficacy, knowledge, and quality of life. All participants received a gift voucher for an online retailer at the end of their participation in the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aliasgharpour-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aliasgharpour 2013</LINK> evaluated an educational programme with the aim of increasing patient self management. The programme consisted of four sessions over one month to groups of four to six participants. In total, 66 participants were randomised to either the educational programme (n = 33) or to a control group (n = 33) who received the usual epilepsy care and support offered by the clinic. The control group also received two brief courtesy telephone calls as a control for attention. Investigators carried out assessments via questionnaire at baseline and at one month. Questionnaires included general measures of demographic details and of disease (i.e. type of convulsions, seizure frequency, time since the last seizure and the number of antiepileptic drugs taken). Trialists measured self management using the Epilepsy Self Management Scale (ESMS).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Strategies to improve patient compliance</HEADING>
<P>Three trials evaluated the effect of strategies to improve patient compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Adamolekun-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adamolekun 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thapar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thapar 2002</LINK>). One recruited participants from general practices in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Thapar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thapar 2002</LINK>), another from outpatients attending an Australian hospital clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK>) and the third from the population of the Zvimba health district in rural Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="STD-Adamolekun-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adamolekun 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A three-arm cluster-randomised trial based in general practices in Greater Manchester, England, <LINK REF="STD-Thapar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thapar 2002</LINK> studied the impact of a 'prompt and reminder card' on the care of people with epilepsy. The study included 1275 participants from 82 practices, stratified according to size then allocated to one of three groups using a random number table. Intervention group 1 (n = 368) gave participants the responsibility of keeping the cards (patient-held card group), and intervention group 2 (n = 515) had the cards placed into patients' records at the practice (doctor-held card group), while the control group (n = 392) did not use cards.</P>
<P>In their study of outpatients attending a hospital clinic in Hobart, Australia, <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK> used a range of strategies to improve patient compliance with anticonvulsant therapy. Fifty-three adults aged between 18 and 74 years entered the trial. Subjects were allocated by coin toss to the control group receiving usual care (n = 26) or the intervention group receiving a package of strategies to improve compliance (n = 27). Outcome measures focused on patient compliance as measured by plasma anticonvulsant levels, prescription refill frequency and appointment keeping.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Adamolekun-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adamolekun 1999</LINK> evaluated the impact of healthcare worker and patient education on care in their study of epilepsy in rural Zimbabwe. As the team did not establish a control group for the first part of the study on health worker education, we excluded this part from this review. We included the second part of the project: studying the impact of information pamphlets on patient management in 400 participants. Health facilities (a district hospital, a mine hospital, 3 rural hospitals and 20 rural health centres) were randomised to one of two groups. The intervention group received patient information pamphlets for distribution to patients with epilepsy and their relatives at clinic visits. Control facilities did not receive the pamphlets. Impact was measured at six months after receipt of the information, by between-group comparisons of clinic attendance, seizure frequency and mean serum drug levels.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Self management through screening</HEADING>
<P>One trial based in a university hospital in the USA evaluated the effect of physicians' use of a risk profile (the Adverse Effects Profile, or AEP) on adverse effects of antiepilepsy drugs and on participants' reported subjective health status (<LINK REF="STD-Gilliam-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilliam 2004</LINK>). Trialists recruited participants attending an epilepsy clinic if their scores on the AEP were 45 or more. In total, 62 adults with epilepsy participated. The AEPs of participants randomised to the intervention group (n = 32) were available to their physicians, while the control group's (n = 30) physicians did not have access. At the end of the four-month trial, investigators re-assessed participants' AEPs as well as the changes in seizure rates, and each subject completed the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89) questionnaire.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alternative care delivery in outpatient clinics</HEADING>
<P>Prior to 1984, there was no specialist unit for epilepsy patients in Cardiff and South Wales, UK so epilepsy patients would most likely be referred to neurology. <LINK REF="STD-Morrow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 1990</LINK> therefore undertook a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the outpatient activities of a specialist epilepsy unit. Individuals referred to hospital with confirmed or suspected epilepsy were submitted for randomisation to the Epilepsy Unit or to a standard neurology clinic. Because the referring physician did not always grant permission for randomisation, the study recruited 64 non-randomised and 232 randomised individuals. We have therefore treated the study as a controlled before-and-after study (intervention, n = 130; control, n = 102) rather than a randomised trial. Outcome assessors evaluated participants at 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures were seizure control, antiepileptic medication, use of other health resources (such as GP consultations), receipt of advice and counselling, patient satisfaction and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Specialist nurse practitioners</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies reporting on five mutually exclusive study populations evaluated the effects of specialist nurse practitioners (<LINK REF="STD-Helde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Helde 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK>). Six studies took place in the UK, four in patients of general practices in southeast England (<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK>), one in hospitals based in the same region (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2000</LINK>) and one in a regional epilepsy clinic in northern England (<LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK>). The remaining study took place in a neurology clinic in Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Helde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Helde 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK> studied the effect of a primary care-based epilepsy nurse from the perspective of patients in 14 general practices in southeast England. Practices were allocated to either intervention or control to ensure similar distributions of size, doctor:patient ratio, socioeconomic status and mean distance from the local general hospital. The study had 574 participants aged 16 years or over with epilepsy (intervention, n = 278; control, n = 296). Intervention group members received information, advice and support from the epilepsy nurse, who also liaised with other professionals and provided education for staff. Participants filled in a self completion questionnaire based on the Living With Epilepsy survey instrument at baseline and after one year. Outcome measures included seizure frequency, AED use, information provision and attitudes to care. Secondary measures included patient preferences and the effect of epilepsy and treatment on everyday life.</P>
<P>Following the completion of the <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK> study, during the second year, the specialist epilepsy nurse worked with participants who had been in the original control group of seven GP practices. <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK> reported on follow-up of 394 participants after two years, comparing participants who had accessed the specialist epilepsy nurse (n = 195) with those who had not (n = 194), regardless of their original group allocation. The same self completion questionnaire used at the end of year one was sent out again at the end of year two. Two hundred forty participants responded to both baseline and year two questionnaires: 60.9% of baseline respondents and 40.3% of the 595 participants with epilepsy in the 14 practices at the start of the trial.</P>
<P>Two papers from the UK based Epilepsy Care Evaluation Group reported outcomes from a trial based in six general practices in southern England (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK>). Two hundred fifty-one adults with epilepsy (aged 17 to 90) were randomised either to specialist nurse based in general practice (n = 127) or usual care (n = 124). Criteria for exclusion were other severe illness (e.g. terminal cancer), severe psychological illness (e.g. active psychosis or severe depression) and low IQ (i.e. associated with learning disability or dementia). <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK> reported on knowledge of epilepsy, depression and anxiety scores at six months, which they assessed using validated questionnaires before and after the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK> reported on patient attendance rate, nurse perception of appropriateness of medical management, and patients' perceptions of level of advice they had received on epilepsy at six months.</P>
<P>A third paper by <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2000</LINK> reported on nurse specialists in the hospital-based care of people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. This trial recruited individuals aged 17 or over from the neurology clinics of five hospitals in southeast England. The intervention matched that of the earlier trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK>), but the study was in the hospital setting, with a specialist epilepsy nurse giving two consultations, three months apart. People with learning disability were again excluded. One hundred two participants were randomised to the intervention (n = 54) or usual care (n = 48). Like <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>, the 2000 study measured knowledge of epilepsy, depression and anxiety scores at six months, assessed by validated questionnaires before and after the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK> evaluated an epilepsy nurse specialist case manager who worked in a regional epilepsy clinic in northern England. The nurse complemented the work of the clinic doctors and replaced them in some aspects of care. <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK> recruited 322 people with epilepsy, aged 16 or over, and then randomised them to the intervention (n = 154) or standard care (n = 168). The sample of participants included patients with learning disabilities, and the study authors stated that they excluded 20 for being unable to complete questionnaires; however, in 19 of these instances, their caregiver completed the questionnaire instead. The caregivers of 248 other participants with epilepsy also completed questionnaires. <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK> reported on a wide range of outcomes, including: seizure frequency; anxiety and depression; impact of epilepsy (functioning); knowledge of epilepsy scores; impact on medical management; psychosocial outcomes for patients and caregivers; patient and general practitioner satisfaction with clinic care; use of other hospital services at six months; and costs of treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Helde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Helde 2005</LINK> recruited 114 adults with epilepsy who attended a neurology clinic at a hospital in Trondheim, Norway into their randomised controlled trial. Using computer-generated block randomisation, the trial allocated participants to either the intervention group (n = 58), which received counselling and teaching from a specialist epilepsy nurse, or to the control group (n = 56), which continued to receive standard care. Investigators measured primary outcomes using the QOLIE-89, which they administered two years after recruitment to the trial. In addition, three months after this, each participant gave the clinic a general satisfaction rating by completing a Visual Analogue Scale.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McAuley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McAuley 2001</LINK> evaluated the impact of a structured exercise programme on behavioural and clinical outcomes in a group of adults with epilepsy in Ohio, USA. Twenty-eight participants aged 16 to 60 years participated in the study, but authors did not describe the source of these participants or recruitment methods. Subjects were randomised to the intervention group (n = 17) or to a control group (n = 11), which received no additional exercise. Trialists conducted baseline physiological evaluations prior to the commencement of the exercise programme, including body composition, maximum oxygen consumption, strength and cardiovascular endurance. They also assessed seizure frequency over the previous four weeks, and monthly after baseline up to 12 weeks, by review of the patients' seizure calendars. All participants also provided AED concentrations (via blood test) and completed the QOLIE-89 at baseline and 12 weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Guideline implementation and patient information</HEADING>
<P>In primary care settings in Tayside, Scotland, UK, <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK> carried out a three-arm randomised controlled trial of the use of epilepsy guidelines by general practitioners. General practitioners from 68 general practices were randomised to an intensive intervention (24 practices), an intermediate intervention (22 practices) or control (22 practices). A copy of a nationally developed clinical guideline was posted in all practices. The intermediate intervention group also received interactive, accredited workshops, and dedicated, structured protocol documents. The intensive intervention group received all the elements of the other two arms with the addition of a nurse specialist who supported and educated practices in the establishment of epilepsy review clinics. The primary patient outcome measure was the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), a general quality of life instrument. Secondary patient outcome measures were epilepsy specific, including the nature and perceived severity of seizures, perceived adverse drug effects, the impact of epilepsy on participants' lives, and their sense of mastery. The study also used the Epilepsy Surgery Inventory 55 Survey (ESI-55), a cognitive function test. Investigators measured all patient outcomes from completed questionnaires. In total, 3284 participants received a questionnaire, and 1133 entered the study by completing a baseline questionnaire, a response rate of 56%. Of these 1133, 399 participants were in the intensive intervention group, 364 in the intermediate intervention group and 370 in the control group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>We considered the risk of bias for random sequence generation to be unclear for six studies due to a lack of information (<LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-2002" TYPE="STUDY">May 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1999</LINK>). We also considered <LINK REF="STD-Thapar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thapar 2002</LINK> to have an unclear risk because on the one hand, there were a much higher number of participants in the doctor-held card group (n = 515) than either the patient-held card group (n = 368) or the control group (n = 392), which could indicate that the randomisation failed (and carried a high risk of bias). On the other hand, given the cluster-randomisation design, the imbalance could equally have indicated that there were a greater number of larger sized general practices (in terms of patient numbers as opposed to numbers of general practitioners) in this group, making the overall risk unclear.</P>
<P>We considered the risk of bias for random sequence generation to be low in seven studies because the process appeared to be methodologically sound (<LINK REF="STD-Aliasgharpour-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aliasgharpour 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gilliam-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilliam 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Helde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Helde 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK>).

On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK> reported a required sample size, but it was not clear if this was the result of a power calculation.

We also considered that there was a possibility of contamination in this study, as patient information could easily have been distributed to control sites. <LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK> reported no details of power calculations or required sample size.

<P>The presentation of results varied considerably between trials and we have been unable to report statistics in an optimal way because of the limitations of the data presented. We considered reporting all continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), but several trials had baseline measures which would require imputing pre-post correlation. Moreover, given that the populations, interventions, study design, treatment settings and outcome measures differed for each trial, we concluded that meta-analysis of the results, even within the same type of outcome, would be inappropriate. We have therefore presented the results of the trials narratively. Thus, all results are presented as originally reported, with standard errors transformed to standard deviations. We have only presented the findings reported that could be considered to match the pre-defined outcomes of our review.

<P>At four months, an evaluation of the SEE programme showed significant differences between groups for hazardous medical self management practices as measured on a subscale of the SEE 50-item questionnaire,between groups over time (P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK>). The trial used a subgroup (n = 26) to evaluate the effect of SEE on compliance with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The intervention group showed significantly increased compliance (as measured by blood AED levels) compared to the control group (percentage change score intervention + 70%, control &#8722; 18%, P &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK> does not offer an explanation of how this subset was chosen, so these results should be interpreted with caution.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Strategies to improve patient compliance</HEADING>
<P>At six months, an evaluation of the combination of compliance-improving strategies reported increases in plasma levels for all AEDs, which resulted in significant differences for two of these AEDs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) at the end of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK>). At six months, phenytoin mean (SD) plasma levels/dose were 9.9 (SD 3.2) in the intervention arm and 7.1 (SD 4.6) in the control arm (P &lt; 0.05). Mean (SD) carbamazepine plasma levels/dose were 9.9 (SD 3.2) in the intervention arm and 7.1 (SD 4.6) in the control arm (P &lt; 0.05). While mean (SD) sodium valproate plasma levels/dose did not differ between groups at 12 weeks (intervention 14.9 SD 2.7; control 20.2 SD 7.9 P &gt; 0.1), levels were lower in the intervention group at baseline (P &lt; 0.01). Hence plasma levels substantially increased within the intervention arm for phenytoin (P = 0.07), carbamazepine (P &lt; 0.02) and sodium valproate (P &lt; 0.02), but investigators did not identify significant increases in the control group (P &gt; 0.2). The study also showed significant differences for prescription refill frequency (defined by dates set in participants' prescription record book) in the intervention group. Compliance increased from 48% to 88% (P &lt; 0.01) in the intervention group, compared to a decrease of 58% to 50% in the control group (P &gt; 0.10). At six months, the differences were significant between groups (P &lt; 0.01). It was not possible from these results alone to judge whether the intervention was associated with clinical improvement, but there was a corresponding statistically significant decrease in seizure frequency. Investigators did not observe any significant changes in measures of clinic appointment keeping. However, they only reported the baseline measures (intervention 59% vs control 65%) while the median number of clinic appointments for both the intervention and control groups during the six-month study period was 2.5.</P>
<P>There were no differences in antiepileptic drug compliance (defined by undetectable plasma phenobarbitone concentration) at six months between groups in the evaluation of a patient pamphlet for trained primary healthcare workers (<LINK REF="STD-Adamolekun-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adamolekun 1999</LINK>). Reported findings were 0% in the intervention group vs 5.3% in the control group.

<P>The evaluation of the prompt and reminder card by <LINK REF="STD-Thapar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thapar 2002</LINK> reported no significant differences in the proportion of participants taking only one antiepileptic drug during the intervention year (doctor-held 69.7%, patient-held 70.1%, control 71.1%) or checking of phenytoin levels (doctor-held 28.7%, patient-held 39.2%, control 31.5%). However, the participants in doctor-held card practices reported a greater number of side effects (defined by patients in the previous year) than the control group (49.3% vs 43.6%, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.17, P = 0.013), as did participants in the patient-held care practices (50.8% vs 43.6%, OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.32, P = 0.016).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alternative care delivery in outpatient clinics</HEADING>
<P>Over the 12-month study period, an evaluation of a specialist epilepsy unit in hospital outpatients reported (although with no detailed data) that there was no significant difference between groups in the number and type of antiepileptic drugs or the number of drugs prescribed per participant (<LINK REF="STD-Morrow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 1990</LINK>). There was, however, a significant reduction in the percentage of drug concentrations outside the reference range in intervention vs control (P &lt; 0.001). This fell from 55% of all participants at baseline to 26% in the intervention group but remained "essentially unchanged" in the control group (proportions not reported). Alongside this finding, there was also a reduction in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the intervention group from 40% to 45% at baseline to around 25% at 12 months, whereas in the control group, the proportion remained unchanged at around 40% to 45% (data only reported graphically, P &lt; 0.001). The proportion of ADRs was lowest at three months in the control group but then began to rise back to baseline levels, whereas in the intervention group, the lowest level was recorded at six months, at which point the difference between groups was also significant (P &lt; 0.05).

For four of these ('taking one type of antiepileptic drug', 'feel very well controlled by drug', 'report very important to take tablets exactly as prescribed' and 'reporting side effects from drugs'), there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK>) or between those who had accessed the specialist epilepsy nurse and those who had not at two years (<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK>). Intervention participants were, however, significantly less likely than controls to have reported never missing taking their antiepileptic drugs (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94, P = 0.032) at two years. There was no significant difference for this outcome between those who had accessed the specialist epilepsy nurse and those who had not (<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK>). All results of this evaluation from both studies should be interpreted with caution because of the weak study design (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) and the large number of comparisons made, which increase the likelihood of a significant finding occurring by chance.</P>
<P>At six months, the evaluation of a general practice-based epilepsy nurse reported on the 'appropriateness of medication supplied' (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 1997</LINK>). This outcome was in fact a measure of the number of occasions when the specialist nurse felt that medication plans could be improved and noted this in the patient record. The trial reported that the epilepsy nurse found that 11.1% of participants required medication management changes. However, authors did not give any information on whether these proposed changes were or were not appropriate, and there was no control group comparison. This trial also reported an increase in measurement of serum levels in the last six months between arms (intervention 29% to 66%, control 23% to 17%, P &lt; 0.01). However, increased serum concentration monitoring was not necessarily clinically desirable, and it was not clear what implications this had for the appropriateness of medication supplied.</P>

The study investigators adjusted these results for baseline value of outcome variable and gender in a multiple regression model. However, as only 50.9% of participants responded to both baseline and follow-up questionnaires, these results should be interpreted with caution. At one year (<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK>), an analysis of those participants who actually saw the epilepsy nurse (as opposed to those who did not) were significantly more likely to have discussed 10 of 11 epilepsy topics with either their GP or hospital doctor (P values not reported). The study investigators adjusted these results for baseline value of outcome variable in a multiple regression model.

<P>At two years, <LINK REF="STD-Helde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Helde 2005</LINK> evaluated a hospital-based specialist epilepsy nurse, showing that there were no significant differences between groups for the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89) (P = 0.58). However, intervention group participants were significantly more likely to have an improved score compared to baseline (P = 0.019). There were also significant improvements from baseline for 3 of 17 sub-items on the QOLIE-89 scale in the intervention group. These were: role limitations - physical (intervention P = 0.05, control P = 0.59), health discouragement (intervention P = 0.01, control P = 0.15) and medication effects (intervention P = 0.04, control P = 0.36).

<P>At 12 weeks, an evaluation of an outpatient exercise programme reported no apparent differences between groups for the QOLIE-89 (overall quality of life), profile of mood states (POMS) or Rosenberg self esteem scales (<LINK REF="STD-McAuley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McAuley 2001</LINK>) but formal statistical tests were not reported between groups. However QOLIE-89 scores showed significant improvement over time overall in the intervention group only (intervention P = 0.03, control P = 0.94) and for two of the six individual domains (physical function P = 0.02 and energy/fatigue P = 0.02). Energy/fatigue also significantly improved in the control group (P &lt; 0.01). There were no differences over time in the total POMS score for the control group, but there was a near significant multivariate effect for time for the intervention group (P = 0.05). Of the five POMS subscales, only vigour improved over time in the intervention group (P = 0.03). There were no changes in any of the psychological variables in the control group or global self esteem in the intervention group. Overall physical self description questionnaire (PSDQ, measuring physical self concept and vigour) scores significantly increased in the intervention group (P &lt; 0.05) at weeks 12 and 16 and for 4 of the 11 domains from the PSDQ scale (physical activity, coordination, endurance and strength). The global physical domain was not significantly different at week 12 but had become so by week 16.

At six months, the intervention default rate was 22.3% in the intervention group vs 56.3% in the control group. However, the significant difference between the two groups in baseline monthly attendance (P = 0.001) precluded a meaningful comparison at six months. Nevertheless, when comparing the magnitude of the change in attendance over the time period, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.2678).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Specialist nurse practitioners</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1998</LINK> reported a whole range of healthcare use and cost measures at six months: one or more visits to GP, number of visits to GP, visits to general practice nurse, visits made by district nurse, visits made by health visitor, visits made by community psychiatric nurse (CPN), visits to outpatient clinic doctor, specialist outpatient clinic psychiatrist consultation, specialist outpatient clinical psychologist consultation, specialist inpatient admission, EEG, CT scan, MR scan, blood level estimation for antiepileptic drugs, other outpatient consultation, other inpatient admission, other day-patient visit and visit to accident &amp; emergency (A&amp;E). The study also assessed primary healthcare cost per patient, secondary healthcare cost per patient and total healthcare cost per patient. While the majority of between-group comparisons reported no significant differences, the study suggested a significant decrease in outpatient clinic hospital attendance with doctors (P &lt; 0.0001) at six months. Proportionately, more intervention participants visited specialist outpatients clinics for psychiatric (1% vs 0%) or psychological assessments (2% vs 1%) than did participants in the control group, but investigators did not formally compare groups with each other, presumably due to small numbers of events. There was a non-significant trend in terms of participants' seeing their GP once or more (P = 0.054) which translated into a significant difference upon comparing the number of times between groups (P = 0.028). Investigators reported that primary care costs were significantly reduced in the intervention arm (P = 0.017) although they noted that these costs were a small proportion of the total cost per patient. Numerically participants in the intervention group made more visits to specialist outpatient clinical psychologists and psychiatrists than did participants in the control group, but there were no formal comparisons between groups. The economic analysis had several limitations, as it was based on the economic consequences for a tertiary care (specialist) centre, only considered the consequences for the health service and did not link financial costs to health or other outcomes. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialist epilepsy nurses are more expensive than standard care.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999a</LINK> reported that healthcare use associated with a primary care-based specialist epilepsy nurse at one year was not significant between groups for any one of the six types of healthcare use measured: saw GP for any reason, saw GP for epilepsy, saw hospital doctor for epilepsy, admitted to hospital for epilepsy, attended A&amp;E department for epilepsy and had regular arrangement to see GP for epilepsy. However, while the healthcare use always decreased after one year in the control group, in the intervention group the proportion who saw their GP for any reason rose from 65.1% to 73.4% as did attendance at A&amp;E (3.8% to 6.6%) and regular arrangements to see GP for epilepsy (15.6% to 16.9%). At two years, <LINK REF="STD-Mills-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Mills 1999b</LINK> reported no significant differences for the same measures between participants who had accessed the specialist nurse and those who had not. While proportions of participants are not reported, it is worth noting that the odds ratio for seeing a GP for any reason was close to achieving statistical significance (OR 1.97, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.00, P = 0.06).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-29 09:05:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The outcomes that the primary trials covered were generally consistent with the outcomes considered in this review. Not all trials considered patient perceptions, and hardly any trials considered the cost-effectiveness of services. In addition, they rarely described the long-term effects of most of the interventions.</P>
<P>Except for the evaluation of specialist epilepsy nurses, the generalisability of any findings may be limited, as the level of detail provided for the interventions varies considerably, and only one study examines each, although we sometimes categorised them within a larger group of similar interventions in this review. In addition, contextual factors such as the intervention setting, the local health system, the reimbursement system, staff training, the nature of participants, the duration of the intervention and evaluation period may have heavily influenced the final results. No trials included a process evaluation to assess how the intervention had been implemented or to investigate any potential barriers to its successful implementation.</P>

<P>The current review is an update of a review we originally conducted in 2006 and revised in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2008</LINK>). Despite the identification of two additional studies in this version (<LINK REF="STD-Aliasgharpour-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aliasgharpour 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2011</LINK>), the overall findings remain largely unchanged. However, three similar reviews have examined psychosocial treatment programmes in epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK>), evidence-based models of care for people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimons 2012</LINK>) and care delivery and self management strategies for children with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2015</LINK>); the last of these is undergoing an update alongside this update for adults. All reviews have reported that there is no clear evidence that any specific service model substantially improved outcomes for children or adults with epilepsy. Likewise, they also note a lack of evidence for cost-effectiveness, although <LINK REF="REF-Mittan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittan 2009</LINK> did calculate that one of the interventions it evaluated (the SEE programme described in <LINK REF="STD-Helgeson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helgeson 1990</LINK>) was likely to be cost-effective by virtue of the fact that this was the only intervention to use a large audience format (up to 850 people) for treatment delivery.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-20 11:08:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-20 11:08:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is clearly plausible that various innovative service models could improve identified problems in epilepsy care by improving the knowledge and awareness of epilepsy amongst clinicians and patients; timeliness and appropriateness of clinical care and advice including medication; follow-up and clinical investigation; and poor communication among clinicians and between clinicians and patients.</P>
<P>There are two interventions supported by some evidence of benefit: specialist epilepsy nurses and self management education. Some evidence from the specialist epilepsy nurse evaluations suggests that certain subgroups of people (such as those who do not have frequent seizures) benefit more than others. However, there is still no clear evidence to suggest that alternative service models substantively improve health or quality of life for people with epilepsy, especially in the longer term. Consequently, it is unknown if the models would provide cost-effective options.</P>
<P>It is also possible that the benefits of these complex interventions are situation-specific and their benefits are not generalisable to other settings. At the moment, results are based on the activity of a few service providers, whose competence and expertise may also have influenced final outcomes, and the trials do not always clearly define the exact nature of the intervention. It is not always clear how service providers have been trained, for instance.</P>
<P>At present, it is not possible to advocate any model to improve outcomes for people with epilepsy. We need further research to investigate the effectiveness of specialist epilepsy nurses before making such recommendations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-29 09:05:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of research on service models to improve outcomes for people with epilepsy, with the possible exception of evaluations of specialist epilepsy nurses and self management education. Generally, the number of studies is small, sometimes with very small participant numbers. There are few high quality studies, so it is likely that the study quality has influenced the final results. In addition, the generalisability of studies is limited.</P>
<P>Further studies are needed that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>offer an improved quality of study design and reporting, particularly in promising areas (e.g. self management education);</LI>
<LI>improve generalisability (e.g. include a full description of the intervention, a process evaluation, and a multicentred assessment of the benefits for more than one population and service provider);</LI>
<LI>evaluate the effects of interventions for those subgroups most likely to benefit (e.g. people with newly diagnosed epilepsy, people with learning disabilities);</LI>
<LI>consider the cost-effectiveness of service models shown to be beneficial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To maximise the potential generalisability of future studies and to ensure study quality, we would recommend randomised controlled trials rather than observational studies. Studies should also ensure that they adequately define and describe interventions and that the study design takes into account contextual factors. Where socially complex interventions are under study (e.g. specialist nurses), the trials must include sufficient service providers to ensure that individual characteristics do not bias the results.</P>

<P>There was considerable variation in the size of the intervention (n = 130) and comparison (n = 102) arms. This occurred not only because clinicians had to agree with each referral, but also because they could withdraw participants from the trial at any time. The fact that the comparator arm (usual care) had many fewer participants as a result of the vetoes being exercised suggests a perceived bias against the comparator from those involved in allocating participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Modular Service Package Epilepsy (MOSES) (May 2002)</HEADING>
<P>MOSES aims to improve individual participants' knowledge of epilepsy, its consequences, and diagnostic and therapeutic measures, and to improve participants' understanding of psychosocial and occupational problems. Participants are encouraged to cope actively with epilepsy, to live with as few limitations as possible, to participate in treatment and to gain more self-esteem. MOSES focuses on improving individuals' self-help potential and on promoting the idea of participants as 'experts' in dealing with their epilepsy. No specific theoretical basis was identified as underpinning the programme. However, the MOSES programme includes cognitive, emotional, and behavioural aims. Aims for the participants are to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>get to know and understand the disease and its consequences;</LI>
<LI>learn to cope with the disease;</LI>
<LI>understand the diagnostic and therapeutic measures and to take over an active part in the treatment process;</LI>
<LI>gain a better understanding of psychosocial problems and occupational aspects;</LI>
<LI>learn to become autonomous;</LI>
<LI>become the 'ambassador of one's own disease';</LI>
<LI>lead an everyday life with as few limitations as possible.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Aims for the trainers are to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>promote the active training of the participants;</LI>
<LI>support empathic relationships with other participants;</LI>
<LI>create an interesting and varied learning atmosphere.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The MOSES modules covered the following (one topic per module).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Living with epilepsy.</LI>
<LI>Epidemiology.</LI>
<LI>Basic knowledge (causes, pathophysiology, types of seizures).</LI>
<LI>Diagnostics.</LI>
<LI>Therapy.</LI>
<LI>Self-control.</LI>
<LI>Prognosis.</LI>
<LI>Psychosocial aspects.</LI>
<LI>Network epilepsy (how to find help and information).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The MOSES programme is delivered over two days (14 sessions of one hour) in epilepsy centres or clinics. In the May 2002 study the programme was delivered in small groups (seven to 10 people, maximum 12) and included interactive teaching, discussions and the use of a specially developed workout manual. Healthcare professionals who had been prepared by a MOSES Train-the-Trainer seminar (including nurses, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists and EEG assistants) delivered the programme.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">WebEase - Epilepsy Awareness, Support, and Education (Dilorio 2011)</HEADING>
<P>The programme incorporates elements of three different theories: social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical model of behaviour change and motivational interviewing.</P>
<P>Three modules (medication management, stress management and sleep management) are delivered using motivational interviewing principles. The purpose of the modules is to enable participants to assess their current status, reflect on their current behaviours, decide whether or not to change behaviour finally create a goal and action plan to either change or maintain their behaviour.</P>
<P>Alongside the modules is an application called MyLog into which participants enter details about their seizures, medication, stress and sleep at the start of the programme. Thereafter daily information is entered into MyLog every time they log onto the WebEase site and MyLog is also used to provide feedback during module sessions. Associated with the modules are a discussion board (My Voice) and a resource component which includes information on learning strategies and links to other useful sites (e.g. Epilepsy Foundation). Finally, to engage participants in learning about epilepsy, daily poll questions and short quizzes could be accessed from the WebEase homepage.</P>
<P>Participants were asked to use the WebEase programme for six weeks (two weeks in each of the three modules). After initially logging into the WebEase site, participants were first required to complete the MyLog section after which they had access to all the other components of WebEase. Participants were sent weekly reminders to log into the site Access to the programme for participants ended after six weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Educational programme on self-management in Iran (Aliasgharpour 2013)</HEADING>
<P>The educational programme was delivered to groups of four to six patients. During the first session, education about the medical aspects of epilepsy was provided by a Master's student in nursing who had prior experience of working on a Brain-Neurology ward in Iran. In the remaining three sessions, self-management information was provided by the same individual in the following areas: medication, information, seizures, safety, and lifestyle education. In all sessions, information was presented using PowerPoint slides, demonstrations, and case histories of patients facing the challenges of epilepsy. In the first session, patients also received leaflets that contained the content of the educational programme.</P>

<P>The role of the specialist nurse was to provide information, advice and support to patients, liaise between different components of the health service and the wider public sector, and educate primary healthcare teams. One-on-one consultations with patients took place either at the practice or in the patient's home.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hospital-based nurse-run specialist-care clinics (Ridsdale 1997, Ridsdale 1999, Ridsdale 2000)</HEADING>
<P>At the nurse-run clinics (in hospitals and primary care), seizure frequency and drug management were discussed, individual patient concerns addressed and advice given. A second appointment was offered three months later. In both instances, the nurse used a structured record card to record the advice she gave.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epilepsy nurse specialist case manager (Warren 1998)</HEADING>
<P>The intervention comprised input from the nurse in the areas of education and of co-ordination and monitoring of care. The nurse complemented the work of the clinic doctors and replaced them in some aspects of care. At the initial consultation the nurse gave structured information on the specialist nurse role and on epilepsy, a care plan was developed and a 'personal health record' was given to the patient. Follow-up care, over a six-month period, was individualised.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Specialist neurology clinic in Norway (Helde 2005)</HEADING>
<P>The intervention was delivered by a single specialist nurse with over 15 years' clinical experience in the care of people with epilepsy. It should be noted that this nurse was also the lead author of the paper. Participants received structured group education provided by a multidisciplinary group of health and social care professionals. The nurse then attended the neurology clinic and telephoned each patient every three months. Participants could also call the nurse if necessary. Nursing care was individualised, and the nurse made appointments with the neurologist as necessary.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Structured exercise programme (McAuley 2001)</HEADING>
<P>The structured exercise programme consisted of three exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks. Programmes were individualised for each participant by an exercise physiologist and lasted for approximately one hour. The exercise programme focused on cardiovascular, strength and flexibility training. To remain in the study intervention group participants had to complete at least 80% of the exercise sessions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Guideline implementation and patient information (Davis 2004)</HEADING>
<P>The guidelines, Diagnosis and Management of Epilepsy in Adults, were produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). Randomisation was by location (practices sharing premises were grouped together as a single location) using computer-generated random numbers. The control group practices received a copy of the guidelines by mail. The intermediate intervention group received the guidelines plus protocol documents and an invitation to an interactive workshop. The intensive intervention group also received input from a nurse specialist in epilepsy, who advised practices and gave information to patients.<BR/>
