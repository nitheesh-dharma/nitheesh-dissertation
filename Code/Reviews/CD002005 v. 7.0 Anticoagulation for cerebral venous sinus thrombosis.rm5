<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:54:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Blood thinning (anticoagulant) drugs may be beneficial for patients with clotting of the veins that surround the brain (sinus thrombosis). Sinus thrombosis is a rare condition where blood clots form in the veins that drain blood from the brain. However, anticoagulant drugs, which are often used to treat sinus thrombosis, carry a risk of bleeding. We only found two small trials involving 79 patients; the results of the review suggested that anticoagulant drugs are probably safe and may be beneficial for people with sinus thrombosis but these results are not conclusive.</P>

<P>We included two small trials involving 79 patients. One trial (20 patients) examined the efficacy of intravenous, adjusted dose unfractionated heparin.

Anticoagulant therapy was associated with a pooled relative risk of death of 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 1.21) and of death or dependency of 0.46 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.31). The absolute reduction in the risk of death or dependency was 13% (95% CI 30% to -3%). No new symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages were observed. One major gastro-intestinal haemorrhage occurred after anticoagulant treatment. Two control patients (placebo) had a diagnosis of probable pulmonary embolism (one fatal).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-09 11:46:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare condition, with a highly variable clinical presentation and prognosis. The estimated incidence is about 2 to 4 per million people per year. A study in children less than 18 years old found a higher incidence of 6.7 per million per year (<LINK REF="REF-deVeber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">deVeber 2001</LINK>). Symptoms and signs include headache, focal or generalised seizures, and neurologic deficits or coma (<LINK REF="REF-Bousser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stam 2005</LINK>). Intracranial pressure is often elevated due to a diminished absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. This may cause papilloedema and, rarely, visual impairment. Obstruction of the venous drainage may cause local cerebral oedema and venous infarcts, which occur in approximately half of all patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2004</LINK>). Venous infarcts are often haemorrhagic and may transform into large and possibly lethal cerebral haemorrhages. On the other hand, many patients have a benign course, with mainly signs of increased intracranial pressure but without neurologic impairment.</P>
<P>Treatment of CVST with anticoagulants has been controversial. Anticoagulant drugs are expected to arrest the thrombotic process and may prevent thrombus propagation, new venous infarcts and neurologic deterioration in patients with CVST. In addition, anticoagulants may prevent pulmonary embolism that can occur in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Diaz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz 1992</LINK>). Anticoagulation may also promote intracerebral haemorrhages (ICH), by causing haemorrhagic transformation of venous infarcts, although well-documented cases of such events are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Bousser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 1997</LINK>). In addition, anticoagulants always carry a risk of extracerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dongen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dongen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several uncontrolled case series suggested that the neurological outcome after cerebral venous sinus thrombosis could be improved with heparin therapy, without an increase in haemorrhagic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Ameri-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameri 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bousser-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villringer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villringer 1994</LINK>). One report described neurologic deterioration after anticoagulant treatment for sinus thrombosis in two patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gettelfinger-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gettelfinger 1977</LINK>), but these examples have been criticised: one patient received urokinase in addition to heparin, and the other developed CVST while on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Bousser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 1997</LINK>). In a large case series from Portugal, new intracranial haemorrhages developed in four of the 112 (3.6%) patients treated with anticoagulants, and in two of 30 (6.7%) patients who did not receive anticoagulants (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK> reported three new ICHs in an uncontrolled series of 56 patients (5.4%) treated with dose-adjusted intravenous heparin. Nevertheless, both studies reported that outcome was better for patients treated with anticoagulants.</P>
<P>In the early 1990s the first small randomised trials were set up to resolve the above-mentioned therapeutic dilemma. This Cochrane Review aimed to combine the results of all randomised trials that compared anticoagulant treatment for CVST with control treatment without anticoagulants and that met pre-defined criteria.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-04-04 15:03:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To review the best available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with CVST. We tested the following hypotheses among patients with confirmed CVST (thrombosis of at least one intracranial venous sinus or cerebral vein).</P>
<OL>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK> performed the first clinical trial of heparin in adult CVST patients. Sixty patients were planned to be included in a single centre trial (Germany), which was stopped after the inclusion of 20 patients (planned interim analysis). The diagnosis of CVST was made by intra-arterial contrast angiography. Patients with the usual contraindications for heparin were excluded. Treatment consisted of intravenous high-dose unfractionated heparin, 25,000 to 65,000 IU/day, after a bolus of 3000 IU, or placebo (saline infusion). The heparin dose was adjusted to obtain a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) value of at least twice the pre-treatment value, and maximally 120 seconds. The treating physician was not blinded but the patients and the physicians who assessed the outcomes were. The primary outcome was the clinical condition at three months after randomisation, assessed with a composite CVST severity scale, with items for headache, focal signs, seizures, and level of consciousness. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), diagnosed by one of two routine CT scans, was the secondary endpoint. After 10 patients in each treatment group were included the study was stopped because a statistically significant effect in favour of heparin was found, based upon scores on the CVST severity scale. Patients in both treatment groups were balanced for baseline variables, except with regard to the duration from onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was 33 days in the heparin group and 25 days in the placebo group.</P>
<P>In the placebo group, three patients died, six survived with a minor deficit and one recovered completely. In the heparin group, two patients had minor deficits and eight recovered completely. According to the CVST severity scale patients with a minor deficit may have slight to severe headaches, transient to mild paresis, or seizures. For the meta-analysis we considered all surviving patients with a minor deficit at three months as good outcomes (independent). There were two patients with new ICHs in the control group, and none in the heparin group. It is not clear whether these ICHs were symptomatic or only detected on the follow-up CT scans.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK> included 60 adult patients in a multi-centre trial in the Netherlands and in the UK. The diagnosis of CVST was made by intra-arterial contrast angiography or by MRI and MR angiography. Patients with the usual contraindications, including recent lumbar puncture for heparin, were excluded. Treatment consisted of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin) in a dose of 180 anti-factor Xa U/kg/24 hour or placebo, administered by two subcutaneous injections daily for three weeks. Patients, treating physicians, and assessors were blinded during the first three weeks. Patients allocated to nadroparin received follow-up treatment with warfarin (non-blinded) for 10 weeks (total duration of anticoagulant treatment 13 weeks). Primary outcomes were scores on the Barthel index (activities of daily living), and on a stroke handicap scale (The Oxford handicap scale), and death. Secondary endpoints were symptomatic ICH and severe extracranial haemorrhage. Assessments were done at three weeks (blind), and at 12 weeks (non-blinded). Sixty patients were randomised (30 in each treatment group). Patients in both treatment groups were balanced for baseline variables, except for isolated intracranial hypertension and CT/MRI infarcts (see below). One patient from the placebo group was withdrawn after randomisation (wrong diagnosis: arterial cerebral infarction). He was independent after three and 12 weeks.</P>
<P>After 12 weeks four of the 30 participants (13%) in the nadroparin group had a poor outcome, defined as death or dependence (Oxford handicap score 3 to 5). In the placebo group six of the 29 participants (21%) had a poor outcome. The open assessment showed essentially similar results to the blind assessment and is used in our meta-analysis. There were no symptomatic intracranial haemorrhagic complications. One patient in the nadroparin group had a major non-fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>A study from India randomised 57 women with puerperal CVST (<LINK REF="STD-Nagaraja-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaraja 1995</LINK>). We excluded this study because the diagnosis was not confirmed by our pre-defined criteria (angiography, MRI/MRA or CT-venography) but by CT only. Patients with signs of cerebral haemorrhage on CT were excluded. Patients were initially treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin, 5000 IU every six hours, and then dose-adjusted to reach a PTT of 1.5 times the initial value. Details of the randomisation procedure, allocation concealment, and pre-defined outcome measures were not given in the published article. Assessment was non-blinded. Twenty-nine patients received heparin and 28 were controls. Two patients in the control group died, and one had a residual paresis at six months. In the heparin group all patients recovered.</P>
<P>A second study from India reported a randomised controlled trial of 40 patients (20 heparin, 20 placebo). This study has been published as an abstract only (<LINK REF="STD-Maiti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maiti 1997</LINK>). According to the abstract, mortality was 15% in the heparin group and 40% in the placebo group. Details of diagnostic confirmation, the randomisation procedure, allocation concealment, and pre-defined outcome measures have not been published. In a personal communication, however, the lead author reported that CVT was not diagnosed by angiography, MRI/MRA or CT-venography in all patients. No placebo was given to the control group and the physicians were not blinded to the treatment allocation. Because of these methodological limitations and the fact that the full results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, we excluded the study from the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies awaiting classification</HEADING>
<P>We also identified a single randomised controlled trial which compares unfractionated heparin with low-molecular-weight heparin in CVST (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006</LINK>). The results of this study have been published as an abstract only. A total of 75 patients were randomised and there was no difference in clinical outcome between the groups at 90 days. Details of diagnostic confirmation, the randomisation procedure, allocation concealment, and outcome measures are not yet available. In a personal communication, one of the principal investigators has indicated that the complete results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK> recruited patients from 15 hospitals in the Netherlands and the UK. Treatment allocation was concealed by using numbered packages containing prefilled syringes with nadroparin or identically appearing placebo. A computer program randomly allocated one of the numbered packages to each patient, according to a stratified block randomisation schedule, with strata for ICH on the pretreatment CT scan, and for chronic intracranial hypertension. A minimisation procedure was applied to allocate approximately equal amounts of control and placebo patients to the strata. An error in the randomisation program caused temporary imbalance, which was corrected during the second half of the trial. Patients and doctors were blinded during the first three weeks of placebo-controlled treatment and at the first assessment at three weeks. The success of blinding was not examined. Follow-up treatment and assessment at 12 weeks were non-blinded. One patient (on placebo) with a wrong diagnosis was withdrawn after randomisation. No patients were lost to follow-up. Baseline data were balanced (age, sex, treatment delay, number with Glasgow Coma Score &lt; 8, seizures, focal deficits, number with ICH), except isolated intracranial hypertension (more in the placebo group) and infarcts on CT/MRI (more in the nadroparin group). Both factors were not significantly associated with outcome in univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis (<LINK REF="REF-de-Bruijn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Bruijn 2001</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 11:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy of anticoagulant treatment</HEADING>
<P>The two small trials which met our predefined inclusion criteria showed a non-significant trend towards fewer deaths or dependency in patients treated with anticoagulants. However, the confidence intervals included no effect and the combined evidence failed to reach conventional statistical significance.</P>
<P>We excluded two other studies from the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Maiti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maiti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagaraja-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaraja 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Maiti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maiti 1997</LINK> has only been published as an abstract and important details about the study design were not available. <LINK REF="STD-Nagaraja-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaraja 1995</LINK> did not meet our predefined criterion: CVST was not diagnosed by angiography, MRI/MRA, or CT-venography. Nevertheless, it seems likely that most of these women had (puerperal) CVST. Interestingly, the small beneficial effect of heparin seen in the included trials was also observed in this study: two of the 28 controls died and no deaths occurred in the 29 patients treated with heparin. Therefore, these results provide some support to the efficacy of heparin in CVST.</P>
<P>The validity of meta-analysis of the two included studies might be questioned because different kinds of heparin were used (<LINK REF="REF-Benamer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benamer 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK> used unfractionated, intravenous, dose-adjusted heparin; <LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK> used subcutaneous, fixed dose, low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin). A Cochrane Review of 22 randomised trials among patients with leg-vein thrombosis showed a better efficacy and fewer haemorrhages of low-molecular-weight heparin compared with unfractionated heparin (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dongen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dongen 2004</LINK>). A recent post-hoc analysis of a large prospective cohort study of CVST suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin also leads to better outcomes and fewer haemorrhagic complications than unfractionated heparin in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Coutinho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coutinho 2010</LINK>). In addition, results of a small randomised study which directly compared low-molecular-weight heparin with unfractionated heparin for CVST have been published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006</LINK>). This study of 75 patients did not show any major differences in efficacy but final results have not yet been published. In summary, the differences in efficacy between low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin, although significant in leg-vein thrombosis, are probably not very large, and combining both CVST trials seems justified as far as treatment is concerned.</P>
<P>A second problem is the difference in the timing of treatment. The average time from initial symptoms to treatment was about four weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK>: 32 days in the heparin group, 25 days in the controls. In <LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK> treatment started after an average of 10 days in the nadroparin group and 11 days in the control group. Some diagnostic delay in CVST is usual. In two non-randomised cohort studies, average delays of four and seven days were reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2004</LINK>). The diagnosis can be difficult due to the variable and often non-specific symptoms. In addition, the diagnosis was more difficult before the advent of MRI. The long therapeutic delay in <LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK> may be caused by a diagnostic delay, although even with intra-arterial angiography a delay of four weeks from onset of symptoms to the start of treatment seems exceptionally long. This delay could also indicate that a subgroup of patients with more prolonged course was recruited, for instance patients who deteriorated after an initial favourable course without anticoagulant treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pulmonary embolism</HEADING>
<P>One of our predefined outcomes was pulmonary embolism (PE). Two cases of clinically diagnosed PE occurred in the placebo groups, but data on diagnostic confirmation were not available. These cases point to a potential benefit of anticoagulants in CVST. Pulmonary embolism is not rare in CVST and might be caused by embolism from a thrombosed sinus or from simultaneous leg-vein thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Diaz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz 1992</LINK>). The latter is not unlikely: many patients with CVST are in a prothrombotic state and often immobilised. As in leg-vein thrombosis an important benefit of anticoagulant treatment in CVST might be the prevention of pulmonary embolism.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intracerebral haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>The main reason for many clinicians avoiding anticoagulants in CVST was the fear of haemorrhagic complications, notably intracerebral bleeding. Many patients with CVST have cerebral haemorrhages or haemorrhagic infarcts at the time of the diagnosis, before treatment (25% in <LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK>; 49% in <LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK>). Yet, few cases of CVST with haemorrhagic deterioration after heparin have been published. In one study of seven patients two new intracerebral haemorrhages developed after anticoagulant treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gettelfinger-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gettelfinger 1977</LINK>). One patient received urokinase in addition to heparin and the other developed CVST while on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Bousser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 1997</LINK>). In two published case series treated with heparin no new intracerebral haemorrhages occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Ameri-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameri 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bruckner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruckner 1998</LINK>), but in two other uncontrolled series intracerebral haemorrhage did occur in 3.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2001</LINK>) and 5.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Einhaupl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Einhaupl 1991</LINK>) of the anticoagulated patients. In the International Study on Cerebral Vein and dural sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT), the largest prospective cohort study on CVST, new intracerebral haemorrhages occurred in 33 of 520 patients (6%) who were treated with heparin in therapeutic dose (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girot-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girot 2007</LINK>). However, this study was not designed to assess new intracerebral haemorrhages after heparin therapy, and follow-up brain imaging was not performed in all patients. In the two trials included in this review no symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages occurred after anticoagulant therapy in 40 patients. This suggests that the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with sinus thrombosis who are treated with anticoagulants is low. However, 0% symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages in 40 patients treated with (low-molecular-weight) heparin is associated with a 95% confidence interval of 0% to 9%, thus an incidence of up to 9% new intracerebral haemorrhages cannot be excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Extracerebral haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>One major extracerebral haemorrhage occurred in a patient treated with low-molecular-weight heparin in <LINK REF="STD-CVST-Group-1999" TYPE="STUDY">CVST Group 1999</LINK>. This rate (3.3%) is within the range to be expected in any group of patients treated with heparin. In a Cochrane Review of 22 trials assessing heparin for leg-vein thrombosis, unfractionated heparin was associated with 2.1% major haemorrhages and low-molecular-weight heparin with 1.0% (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dongen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dongen 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Our post-hoc sensitivity analysis, including the data from the two trials which did not meet our eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Maiti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maiti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagaraja-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaraja 1995</LINK>), were of interest but must be interpreted with great caution since they are potentially subject to bias. However, the effects observed were consistent with those from the included studies and provide limited additional support for our carefully worded conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Anticoagulation in paediatric patients</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any randomised trial that included paediatric patients and data on the safety of heparin in children from other studies are limited (<LINK REF="REF-deVeber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">deVeber 2001</LINK>). As a result, it was not possible to provide an evidence-based recommendation from randomised trials on the use of anticoagulation in these patients. International guidelines tentatively recommend the use of anticoagulation in older children and in selected neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Monagle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monagle 2008</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Roach-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roach 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saposnik-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saposnik 2011</LINK>) and heparin is being increasingly used in paediatric patients (<LINK REF="REF-deVeber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">deVeber 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieira-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieira 2010</LINK>). A recent post-hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study of 162 paediatric cases of CVST showed that protocol-based anticoagulant treatment (heparin, enoxaparin and warfarin) was associated with a significant reduction in thrombus propagation (<LINK REF="REF-Moharir-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moharir 2010</LINK>) and was associated with new or increased bleeding in 6%, all non-fatal bleeds. Propagation was significant in that it was associated with new venous infarcts in 10% of neonates and 40% of children and with worse clinical outcome in children (P = 0.053). While these data provide some support for the use of anticoagulation in children, a randomised trial seems warranted, especially in neonates.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-09-22 13:20:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan M Coutinho">
<P>Anticoagulant treatment in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis appears to be safe and is associated with an apparent reduction in the risk of death or dependency which did not reach statistical significance. In the absence of more information from randomised trials clinicians will need to base their treatment decisions on the limited information available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-09 11:58:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although the estimated pooled risk reductions did not reach statistical significance, patients and doctors may be reluctant to embark upon a new trial in adult patients that includes a placebo group. International guidelines recommend the use of heparin as the primary treatment of patients with CVST, regardless of the presence of baseline intracerebral haemorrhagic lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Einhaupl-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Einhaupl 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saposnik-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saposnik 2011</LINK>), and most physicians follow this recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2004</LINK>). In paediatric patients, especially neonates, a randomised trial seems warranted.</P>
<P>Large consecutive cohort studies have helped to identify subgroups of patients with a poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2004</LINK>). In such patients randomised trials testing more aggressive, and probably more hazardous, therapies such as local (direct) thrombolysis or thrombosuction, are justified and needed.</P>
