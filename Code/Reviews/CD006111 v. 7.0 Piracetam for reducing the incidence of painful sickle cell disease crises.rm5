<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence to assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders and affects about 250 million people (5% of the world's population). It is characterised by sickle-shaped red blood cells which may block blood vessels. This can lead to pain and damage to the major organs such as the brain, liver and spleen. Standard care is mainly supportive and in response to symptoms. Pain is controlled with drugs for pain relief and fluids to improve fluid levels. In vitro studies with piracetam have shown that it hinders the bonding of sickle haemoglobin and the bunching together of platelets. It also makes the blood less sticky and red blood cells more flexible.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 21 September 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The authors of the review identified three trials, two of which had a cross-over design. The quality of the trials was poor. There were wide differences in the people taking part, the drug dose and the outcomes measured. Three trials are included. They provide some weak and unreliable evidence that piracetam prevents painful sickle cell crises. This lack of reliable evidence illustrates some of the doubt and lack of support for the routine use of this treatment for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. The review authors conclude that future research should aim to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether piracetam is of use. Further randomised controlled trials should be well-designed and reported according to the 'Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)' statement.</P>
<P>We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data were collected from the trials. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-19 14:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Three trials involving 169 participants were included in the review. A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary and some of the secondary outcomes were provided, but data were incomplete and based on un-validated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes. One trial reported a reduction in the number of pain crises and their severity with active intervention than placebo but presented no data to confirm these results. A second trial presented a monthly global pain score based on the number of sickle cell crises and severity of pain but included no separate data for these primary outcomes. Although there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87) in one trial, inconsistencies in the criteria necessary for hospitalisation during sickle crises did not permit accurate conclusions to be drawn. Two of the trials reported participant satisfaction with piracetam but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed. There were no reports of toxicity or adverse effects with piracetam other than one participant who experienced dizziness.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 11:48:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The small number of included trials and their poor methodological quality provided insufficient reliable evidence to support the routine use of this medication for preventing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-19 14:01:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalence and aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders, affecting primarily people of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Indian descent. Approximately 250 million people (5% of the world's population) carry a potentially pathological haemoglobinopathy gene (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). In the USA there are approximately 75,000 African-Americans (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2002</LINK>) and in the UK 10,000 British people living with sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>). As a result of under-reporting, genetic diseases are likely to be systematically underestimated in developing countries, but some reliable data are available. In the Middle East, e.g. Bahrain, the burden of disease is quite high; 1% to 2% of all neonates have sickle cell disease, whilst 11% of the total are carriers of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Arrayed-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Arrayed 1995</LINK>). Several of the neighbouring countries have indicated similar levels of sickle cell disease in their populations, but comprehensive and up-to-date information is scanty and often unavailable.</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease occurs when the haemoglobin variant HbS gene is inherited from both parents (HbSS), which is the most prevalent form of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>) or from one parent in combination with another haemoglobin variant gene such as (HbSC) or sickle-ß-thalassaemia (S-ß-Thal). People with homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) have a mutated beta globin gene (bS), which causes the production of abnormal sickle haemoglobin.</P>
<P>The disease is characterised by the presence of distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells in the blood stream. These arise as a result of the polymerisation (a gelling of the molecules) of the abnormal haemoglobin in the red blood cells when they release their combined oxygen. The accompanying red blood cell dehydration then tends to increase the intracellular concentration of the sickle haemoglobin which may in turn lead to further polymerisation. The presence of these dense, irregular and fragile dehydrated cells can contribute to blocking of blood vessels (vaso-occlusion) which can lead to pain episodes also known as crises, and may even cause damage to major organs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Most manifestations of the disease are attributed to either premature red cell destruction (haemolysis) or obstruction of blood flow (vaso-occlusion). Vaso-occlusive crises can produce pain particularly in muscles, bone and joints. Severe vaso-occlusion leading to splenic infarction may result in an increased vulnerability to severe infections and exceptionally to acute splenic sequestration (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Life-threatening complications will require hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Balkaran-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkaran 1992</LINK>) and can include acute chest syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Castro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castro 1994</LINK>), splenic sequestration (<LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>) in addition to the more chronic events of later life resulting from renal disease and heart failure. Children are at exceptional risk of cognitive impairment as a result of the neurological changes which can occur with overt and subclinical strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain is one of the most common symptoms in sickle cell disease. Its onset and severity is unpredictable and recurrent acute episodes can occur throughout life and may require pain medication and hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Brozovic-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brozovic 1987</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Standard care for sickle cell crises is mainly supportive and symptomatic, utilising analgesics and hydration for pain control, and may include transfusion for anemia. Prophylaxis with daily oral penicillin has been used to reduce the rate of infection and the mortality related to pneumococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). Antibiotic therapy should be used to treat resulting infections and the administration of oxygen has been said to be useful in helping relieve some of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>). Attempts at finding a drug to prevent the red cells from sticking to the walls of blood vessels and each other have had limited success and the options for a successful cure are few.</P>
<P>Hydroxyurea, the subject of another Cochrane Review, is known to raise foetal haemoglobin and decrease cellular dehydration. It has been shown to be both effective and safe in severely affected SS adults but also has recognised side effects such as cytopenia (low white cell or platelet count) and occasional nausea (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Piracetam</HEADING>
<P>Piracetam (2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, Nootropyl), a cyclic derivative of gamma-amino butyrate has been used for the treatment of mental function and dyslexia and as it has no known side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 1991</LINK>) and in view of its anti-sickling effect in vivo (<LINK REF="REF-Moriau-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moriau 1993</LINK>) has been considered as a possible therapeutic agent for management of sickle cell disease crises. Most of the in vitro studies with piracetam, have shown that it interferes with HbS polymerisation, causes a reduction in blood viscosity, an increase in erythrocyte elasticity, inhibits platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Asakura-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asakura 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gini-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gini 1987</LINK>) and has the potential for inhibition and a reversal of the process of sickling of erythrocytes (<LINK REF="REF-de-Araujo-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Araujo 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies on the efficacy of piracetam in sickle cell disease crises have shown conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>); and this systematic review seeks to assess the available evidence.</P>
<P>Thi is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.</P>

<P>Three randomised controlled trials, including 169 participants, met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikati-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikati 1983</LINK>).

For the El Hazimi trial we chose to use the most recent published report of this trial in our review as it provided more complete data and trial details. The other references to this trial are listed as secondary references under the primary reference (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>). For the Avim trial we used the initial publication in 2005 as this was the primary reference; the 2009 reference was a supplementary publication (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alvim trial</HEADING>
<P>The Alvim trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial conducted in Brazil from September 1998 to December 1999 (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>). A pilot study was carried out to determine the appropriate sample size and to test "the questionnaires and pain scores". The authors confirmed that this was an observational study and did not include any intervention. Several of the participants in the pilot study were also included in the clinical trial but all pain scores recorded during the pilot study were discarded at the start of the clinical trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 80 participants were enrolled, but 7 were considered non-compliant during the early part of the trial and were excluded from the analysis leaving 73 children (33 males) aged 5 to 20 years (median 12.1). All were suffering from sickle cell disease and were diagnosed as, Hb SS 42 (57.5%), HbSC 26 (35.5%), and 5 (7%) Hb Sß thalassaemia. The authors indicated that the genotype of participants enrolled in the trial was confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis but the diagnostic details were not reported.</P>
<P>The trial authors specified as their inclusion criteria for this trial that all participants should have experienced moderate to severe painful crises defined as painful episodes of variable intensity and duration occurring in the limbs, vertebral spine and thorax or abdomen and which had been recognised by patients and carers as the typical pain attributable to the disease. Other painful events, i.e. priapism, avascular bone necrosis, osteomyelitis and acute chest syndrome were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were: (1) renal, hepatic, cardiac or coagulation disorders secondary or not, to sickle cell disease; (2) regular blood transfusion, whatever the indication; (3) use of hydroxyurea; (4) age above 20 or below 5 years; (5) cognitive dysfunction that would hinder the reporting of pain<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Fifty of the participants had received one or more transfusions before the start of the trial, 5 (6.3%) had undergone splenectomy and a further five cholecystectomy. Acute splenic sequestration had occurred in 12 (15%), osteomyelitis in 11 (13.8%), aplastic crisis in one, and avascular necrosis of the femoral head in 4 (5%) participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Randomisation was to oral piracetam 4.8 g/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day every six hours or placebo. Piracetam was administered to half the participants and placebo to the other half for six months and these were crossed over for the following six months. The trial included a four-week washout period, at cross-over, consisting of a tapering off for two weeks followed by an additional two weeks without any medication. Compliance with the trial regimen was reinforced through regular home calls, evaluated by a pill count and monitored by regular urinary assay of piracetam levels.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Participants or their carers, or both, completed weekly questionnaires which assessed the clinical status and symptoms of the participants. The questionnaires recorded aspects of general well-being, the frequency length and type of painful crises, pain intensity and its site, the effect of the disease on school or work attendance, as well as sleeping, eating and other daily activities, the type of analgesia used and any need for ambulatory medical assistance or hospital admission. Pain intensity was assessed on a three-point ordinal scale, (0 = no pain, 1 = bearable pain, 2 = unbearable pain), from which monthly pain scores were calculated. In addition clinicians completed monthly questionnaires, which recorded and characterised the painful crises and their treatment, during the course of the trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">El-Hazimi trial</HEADING>
<P>The El-Hazimi trial was a multicentre double-blind, randomised, parallel group trial conducted from 1992 to 1994 in 13 centres in Saudi Arabia (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 101 children aged three to 12 years who had sickle cell disease (SCD and Hb S/ß thalassemia) were enrolled in the trial. The trial authors indicated that 16 dropped out at an early stage and that only 87 completed the trial. We have tried to contact the trial authors by electronic mail on several occasions to seek clarification of the discrepancy in the numbers of participants who were enrolled, those who dropped out and those who completed the trial but so far have received no response. The majority of the participants (79) were from the Western region of Saudi Arabia, where the Benin haplotype is prevalent, whilst the remainder (eight) were from the Eastern region, and had the Saudi Indian haplotype.</P>
<P>Baseline data of sex, age, height, weight, number of crises, number of blood transfusions and hospitalisations, the 'Severity index' (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hazmi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hazmi 1990</LINK>) and the 'Gini score' (<LINK REF="STD-Gini-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gini 1987</LINK>) were recorded at enrolment. The bibliographical reference quoted by the authors, to this 'score', does not provide any additional information and refers to an index of red cell deformability (IRCD) which does not appear to be directly related to the 'Gini score'.</P>
<P>The trial authors indicated that at enrolment the diagnosis and classification of participants as SS or Sß0 thalassemia was based on the results of haemoglobin electrophoresis, red cell indices, HbA2 and Hb F levels but did not provide the values for these individual genotypes.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for the trial specified that at entry the participants should have a disease severity greater than six as measured on the 'Severity index' (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hazmi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hazmi 1992</LINK>). This index, which was developed by the authors and does not appear to be internationally recognised, was designed to be used as a quantitative measure of the severity of sickle cell disease based on a combination of hematological, biochemical and clinical parameters consisting of six reversible and seven chronic complications which occur in sickle cell disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The participants were randomised to receive oral piracetam (48) or placebo (39) in a dose of 160 mg/kg/day but during any crisis they were admitted to hospital and received 300 mg/kg/day of piracetam or placebo by intravenous infusion. On discharge the participants were returned to their standard oral regimen. The report did not record if any tests of regimen compliance were carried out during the course of the trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Clinical assessments were carried out routinely every 8 to 12 weeks during the trial period and included the recording of routine hematological and biochemical parameters, the point scores of which were added up to provide an annual 'Severity index'. During any admissions participants were assessed clinically and blood samples were taken for evaluation of hematological parameters. At the conclusion of the trial, all participants living in Riyadh were followed up every three months for the whole of the following year.</P>
<P>Outcomes assessments for this trial were largely based on the 'Severity index' which consisted of a checklist of parameters which were described as possible reversible and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Several of the items in this index were poorly defined and based on unsubstantiated assumptions of clinical status in sickle cell disease. Reversible complications included among others the number of transfusions received by participants but as clinical decisions for transfusion may be based on arbitrary criteria and not infrequently on the preferences of the individual clinician, this item might be considered an unreliable indicator of severity of sickle cell disease. Other items which were listed as chronic complications included cardiomyopathy, papillary necrosis and gallstones but were also equally ill-defined and the authors did not clarify if any of these complications were detected as a result of symptoms or through routine screening, nor how they would be able to detect impotence in children under 12 years old. This index was developed by the authors as a quantitative measure of the severity of the sickle cell disease which they state that they found to be a useful measure to assess the beneficial effect or otherwise of the drug. However, the absence of a scaling capability of any of the individual items in this index may also reflect its poor sensitivity and competency to discriminate the degree in severity of individual pain crises. The authors also indicated that they used the 'Gini score' for evaluation of disease severity and whilst including data for both intervention groups in their report they did not provide any information on how this score was calculated or how the assessments were made.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mikati trial</HEADING>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In the clinical trial the participants received either piracetam I0 mg/kg/day orally in four daily doses, or placebo consisting of identical capsules which contained 300 mg lactose. The capsules were "chosen randomly" and the participants took them for five months, and then the interventions were crossed-over for a similar period but no information about a washout period or any further trial details were provided by the authors. The 'experimental' study included in this report was an observational study which assessed the effects of piracetam on erythrocyte survival, in a separate group of participants and is therefore not included in this review.</P>

<P>A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary, in addition to some of the secondary outcomes, was provided by all three of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikati-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikati 1983</LINK>). These data, as discussed in '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' and '<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>', are based on unvalidated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes, therefore we have not entered these data into the RevMan analyses but present the reported data within '<LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK>' where appropriate (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Number of painful sickle cell disease crises</HEADING>
<P>The average number of pain crises per participant per month reported in the Mikati trial was 0.89 with piracetam and 1.85 with placebo (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Mikati-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikati 1983</LINK>). The severity of these crises was reportedly much less with active intervention than placebo but no data were available to confirm these results.</P>
<P>The authors in the El-Hazmi trial reported data for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>). <I>See</I> '<LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK>' (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The Alvim trial did not provide any separate data for the number of sickle cell crises or severity of pain but included these in a monthly global pain score which was calculated by combining data on the length and intensity of each episode during the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>). However, it was not possible to unravel these data to provide information on the primary outcomes specified for this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2<I>.</I> Mortality</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials provided data on mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Pain: intensity and duration</HEADING>
<P>Only the Alvim trial assessed pain severity but the data were included in a monthly pain score and not available as separate scores (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Requirement for opiate treatment</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials provided any data on requirement for opiate requirement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Serious complications</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials provided data on serious complications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Red cell dehydration</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials provided data on red cell dehydration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Number of other sickle-related events</HEADING>
<P>The only event reported was of one child with a deep ulcer on her cheek which was alleged to have improved dramatically during the course of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Only generalised and subjective improvements were reported, none of which were supported by any validated instruments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Hospitalisation</HEADING>
<P>In the Alvim trial, the number of days of hospitalisation ranged from 0 to 42 (median 1) and in 93.5% a painful crisis was involved but there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87).</P>
<P>Data for the number of hospitalisations were reported in the El-Hazimi trial (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>). <I>See </I>'Additional tables' (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8<I>.</I> Satisfaction with medication</HEADING>
<P>The authors in the Alvim trial reported that nearly all participants and their relatives indicated their satisfaction with the clinical course of the trial, but no details were provided about how this was evaluated or the type of questionnaire or assessment tool that was employed (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>). El-Hazmi indicated that parents of the participants insisted on continuation of therapy, thereby showing their satisfaction but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>No clinical or laboratory evidence of toxicity to piracetam was reported in either the Alvim or the El-Hazmi trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alvim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hazmi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hazmi 1998</LINK>). The authors in the Mikati trial reported that one participant experienced dizziness with the drug (<LINK REF="STD-Mikati-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mikati 1983</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-09-30 11:49:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The lack of reliable evidence for the effectiveness of piracetam is illustrated by the paucity of trials retrieved for this review. However, the wide divergence of reported results in the included trials and the apparent lack of popularity of this drug by clinicians over the past 20 years would appear to suggest and possibly confirm some of the uncertainty in the effectiveness of this medication in preventing painful sickle cell crises.</P>
<P>The episodic nature of sickle cell crisis pain, with its propensity to affect multiple sites, difficulties in conducting pain prevention studies in sickle cell disease, the relatively subjective nature of observer-rated pain intensity, and the absence of a drug which meets a 'gold standard' that can be compared to either piracetam or any other known compounds with established effectiveness in preventing or reducing pain in sickle cell crises by treating the sickling process, sets challenges for any future trials of effectiveness of this specific medication.</P>
<P>We will continue to run searches on a two-yearly cycle to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of this review until new trials are published.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 12:37:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of this medication for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-07 12:37:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Future research should aim to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether piracetam is effective and therefore any further randomised controlled trials should use larger samples, longer intervention and washout periods if appropriate, include a lengthier follow-up period and be reported according to the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement</A>.</P>
