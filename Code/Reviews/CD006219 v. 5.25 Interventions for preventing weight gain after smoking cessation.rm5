<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-06 15:44:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>When giving up smoking, most people put on weight. Many smokers are concerned about this and say it may put them off making an attempt quit. Some studies show that weight gain also leads to people resuming smoking after an initially successful quit attempt. On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that trying to limit weight gain may reduce the chance of stopping smoking. Several drug and behavioural programmes to limit post cessation weight gain have been tested. Of the drug treatments, naltrexone showed the most promise, but there were no data on its effects on weight once drug treatment stopped and there was not enough evidence to judge its effects on long term quitting. Weight management education alone did not limit weight gain and may undermine cessation. Weight management education with personalised support giving feedback on personal goals and a personal energy prescription limited weight gain and there was no evidence that it undermined cessation. Intermittent use of a VLCD improved cessation success and weight gain in the short term but not in the longer term.</P>
<P>Some smoking cessation treatments also limited weight gain. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline all limited weight gain during treatment, however the effects on weight gain reduction were smaller after the treatment had stopped and there was insufficient evidence to be sure that these effects persisted in the long-term. There was some evidence to suggest that exercise reduced post cessation weight gain but more studies are needed to clarify whether this was a chance finding. The effects of all interventions were modest in relation to the average weight gain that follows stopping smoking.</P>

<P>Most people who stop smoking gain weight. There are some interventions that have been designed to reduce weight gain when stopping smoking. Some smoking cessation interventions may also limit weight gain although their effect on weight has not been reviewed.</P>

<P>To systematically review the effect of: (1) Interventions targeting post-cessation weight gain on weight change and smoking cessation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-06 11:18:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Part 1 - We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register and CENTRAL in September 2011. </P>
<P>Part 2 - In addition we searched the included studies in the following "parent" Cochrane reviews: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists and exercise interventions for smoking cessation published in Issue 9, 2011 of the Cochrane Library.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-06 15:20:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Part 1 - We included trials of interventions that were targeted at post-cessation weight gain and had measured weight at any follow up point and/or smoking cessation six or more months after quit day.</P>
<P>Part 2 - We included trials that had been included in the selected parent Cochrane reviews if they had reported weight gain at any time point.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-05 10:17:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data on baseline characteristics of the study population, intervention, outcome and study quality. Change in weight was expressed as difference in weight change from baseline to follow up between trial arms and was reported in abstinent smokers only. Abstinence from smoking was expressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the inverse variance method for weight and Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-06 16:06:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Part 1: Some pharmacological interventions tested for limiting post cessation weight gain (PCWG) resulted in a significant reduction in WG at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (Mean difference (MD) -2.50&#8197;kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.98 to -2.02, 1 study), phenylpropanolamine (MD -0.50&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-0.80 to -0.20, N=3), naltrexone (MD -0.78&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-1.52 to -0.05, N=2). There was no evidence that treatment reduced weight at 6 or 12 months (m). No pharmacological intervention significantly affected smoking cessation rates.</P>
<P>Weight management education only was associated with no reduction in PCWG at end of treatment (6 or 12m). However these interventions significantly reduced abstinence at 12m (Risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90, N=2). Personalised weight management support reduced PCWG at 12m (MD -2.58&#8197;kg, 95% CI -5.11 to&#8197;-0.05, N=2) and was not associated with a significant reduction of abstinence at 12m (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43, N=2). A very low calorie diet (VLCD) significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -3.70&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-4.82 to&#8197;-2.58, N=1), but not significantly so at 12m (MD -1.30&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-3.49 to 0.89, N=1). The VLCD increased chances of abstinence at 12m (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73, N=1). There was no evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy to allay concern about weight gain (CBT) reduced PCWG, but there was some evidence of increased PCWG at 6m (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.24). It was associated with improved abstinence at 6m (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.13, N=2) but not at 12m (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.86, N=2). However, there was significant statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Part 2: We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.25&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-0.78 to 0.29, N=4) however a significant reduction was found at 12m (MD -2.07&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-3.78 to&#8197;-0.36, N=3).</P>
<P>Both bupropion and fluoxetine limited PCWG at the end of treatment (bupropion MD -1.12&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-1.47 to&#8197;-0.77, N=7) (fluoxetine MD -0.99&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-1.36 to&#8197;-0.61, N=2). There was no evidence that the effect persisted at 6m (bupropion MD -0.58&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-2.16 to 1.00, N=4), (fluoxetine MD -0.01&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-1.11 to 1.10, N=2) or 12m (bupropion MD -0.38&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-2.00 to 1.24, N=4). There were no data on WG at 12m for fluoxetine.</P>
<P>Overall, treatment with NRT attenuated PCWG at the end of treatment (MD -0.69&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-0.88 to&#8197;-0.51, N=19), with no strong evidence that the effect differed for the different forms of NRT. There was evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity caused by one study which reported a 4.3&#8197;kg reduction in PCWG due to NRT. With this study removed, the difference in weight change at end of treatment was -0.45&#8197;kg (95% CI&#8197;-0.66 to&#8197;-0.27, N=18). There was no evidence of an effect on PCWG at 12m (MD -0.42&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-0.92 to 0.08, N=15).</P>
<P>We found evidence that varenicline significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.41&#8197;kg, 95% CI&#8197;-0.63 to&#8197;-0.19, N=11), but this effect was not maintained at 6 or 12m. Three studies compared the effect of bupropion to varenicline. Participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment (-0.51&#8197;kg (95% CI&#8197;-0.93 to&#8197;-0.09&#8197;kg), N=3). Direct comparison showed no significant difference in PCWG between varenicline and NRT.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-12-06 16:00:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Although some pharmacotherapies tested to limit PCWG show evidence of short-term success, other problems with them and the lack of data on long-term efficacy limits their use. Weight management education only, is not effective and may reduce abstinence. Personalised weight management support may be effective and not reduce abstinence, but there are too few data to be sure. One study showed a VLCD increased abstinence but did not prevent WG in the longer term. CBT to accept WG did not limit PCWG and may not promote abstinence in the long term. Exercise interventions significantly reduced weight in the long term, but not the short term. More studies are needed to clarify whether this is an effect of treatment or a chance finding. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline reduce PCWG while using the medication. Although this effect was not maintained one year after stopping smoking, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes to prevent weight gain after cessation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-17 16:24:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although smoking cessation is associated with substantial health benefits, it is usually accompanied by weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1997</LINK>). In the USA it is estimated that 80 percent of people who quit smoking gain weight (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1990</LINK>). Studies have found that on average women gain more weight than men. Among people who sustained quitting for five years, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1998</LINK> found that women gained 5.2 kg in year one and a mean of 3.4 kg in years one to five, while men gained a mean of 4.9 kg in year one and a mean of 2.6 kg in years one to five. As well as gaining more weight, a large cohort study showed that 13% of women compared with 10% of men had a major weight gain greater than 13kg (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1991</LINK>). Weight gain in people who sustained quitting for eight years has been shown to be 9kg (7kg above those who continued to smoke during this time), with 42% of people gaining over 10kg (<LINK REF="REF-Lycett--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lycett 2011</LINK>). This weight gain can have health consequences, with the incidence of diabetes being higher in smokers that quit smoking than continue with it, an effect that appeared to be explained by weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2010</LINK>). Weight gain also reduces some of the benefits of quitting smoking on lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Chinn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among smokers there is a high prevalence of concerns about post-cessation weight gain, and it has been cited as a primary reason for putting off quit attempts, especially in women (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1992</LINK>). Weight consciousness has been found to predict current smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Weekley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 1992</LINK>), and weight gain experienced during or after smoking cessation has been associated with relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klesges-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klesges 1992</LINK>). However there is inconsistent evidence that fear of weight gain or actual weight gain after quitting does in fact lead to relapse. An equal number of studies show that it does (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Copeland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 Copeland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomerleau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomerleau 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2006</LINK>) and does not (<LINK REF="REF-Killen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fidler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fidler 2009</LINK>), and methodological differences make it hard to draw a conclusion one way or the other.</P>
<P>Some smoking cessation interventions have been developed to promote smoking cessation and simultaneously control weight gain in challenging populations, such as weight-concerned smokers. They include behavioural interventions, such as exercise and energy restriction or healthy eating advice. Dietary interventions might serve to encourage reluctant quitters to try to stop smoking if they can be reassured that weight gain might be limited (<LINK REF="REF-Filozof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filozof 2004</LINK>). However, it is possible that such interventions might also risk undermining the success of the quit attempt (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>). There is evidence that hunger and cigarette cravings are related, and that hunger can undermine quit efforts (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>) and that hunger increases urges to smoke in current smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Cheskin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheskin 2005</LINK>). Additionally, early weight gain has also been found to be associated with successful cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Gritz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gritz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1991</LINK>). This suggests interventions that limit dietary intake may potentially reduce smoking cessation success and the adage that smokers should stop smoking first and then diet and not do these concurrently has become common in smoking cessation clinics.</P>
<P>There are a range of other treatments for smoking cessation that have been developed independently of concerns about weight gain, with the sole aim of assisting smoking cessation. Some of these, such as nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, varenicline and exercise might plausibly influence weight gain as well as smoking cessation. The effects of these interventions on smoking cessation are evaluated in the relevant Cochrane reviews, but the effects on weight gain are summarised only in the exercise intervention review (<LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2008</LINK>). The effects of these medications on weight gain will therefore be included in this review.</P>
<P>In this review, we examine the effect of interventions on weight gain in abstinent smokers only, for several reasons. Firstly, if we included those who were not abstinent mean weight gain would be reduced. This is because people who try to become abstinent but fail after a few days do not gain weight, while those who relapse to smoking seem to lose the weight they gained previously (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lycett--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lycett 2011</LINK>). Thus the average weight gain of a mixed population of abstinent and non-abstinent smokers would not reflect the weight gain of either. Secondly, this effect could bias trial results. If an intervention increased abstinence rates, it is very likely that it would appear to increase weight gain, regardless of whether it actually suppressed weight gain or had no effect. Thirdly, those who return to smoking tend not attend clinics for follow up. Authors typically only report weight data in abstinent smokers and imputing missing data on this weight is problematic. We have so little data on the weight trajectory of people who try and fail to achieve abstinence. It is likely that the weight will depend on time since relapse and that simple practices as used in weight loss trials, such as last observation forward or baseline observation carried forward, are likely to be misleading. For these reasons, we eschew the intention to treat approach which is typically used in the Tobacco Addiction Review Group's reviews. This issue has been discussed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons_x002c_-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons, 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spring-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spring 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spring-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spring 2011b</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-12-06 13:58:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Part 1 - We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register of trials in September 2011, using the following search terms in title, abstract or keywords: food, calorie restrict*, intake, diet*, body mass index (BMI), Quetelet, waist-hip ratio (WHR), weight, body-weight, weight-changes. At the search date the specialized register included reports of trials indexed in MEDLINE to update 20110826, EMBASE to 2011 week 33, PsycINFO to 20110822 and Web of Science, together with hand searching of specialist journals, conference proceedings, online registers of controlled trials and reference lists of previous trials and overviews. In addition, we performed citation searches of studies included in part 1 to exhaust possibilities of finding published weight data. </P>
<P>Part 2 - We searched the following Cochrane reviews: Antidepressants for smoking cessation (latest search, Jul 2009) <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2007</LINK>, Exercise interventions for smoking cessation (latest search, July 2008) <LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2008</LINK>, Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation (latest search, Oct 2007) <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2008</LINK>, Cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists (rimonabant) for smoking cessation (latest search, Jan 2011) <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2011a</LINK> and Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation (latest search, Oct 2010) <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2011b</LINK> published in Issue 9 2011 of the Cochrane library. The text of references listed as included studies were searched except for the nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation review where we were only interested in trials of varenicline. In addition we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 4, 2011 to identify trials relevant to the Part 2 reviews published since the last update.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-30 12:38:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Two people independently identified studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and extracted data. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved. Papers published in a foreign language were translated into English. Where weight gain had been measured but not reported at all or in full we contacted authors or sponsors for clarification. If we were unable to successfully contact an author or sponsor, studies were excluded from the review.</P>
<P>For studies in Part 1, we extracted data on baseline characteristics, the intervention, smoking, weight data relevant to study quality. Where possible we extracted smoking outcomes as continuous biochemically confirmed abstinence, however we accepted less strict definitions if confirmed continuous abstinence was not available. We checked that, for smoking abstinence estimates, participants lost to follow up were coded as smokers and therefore all randomised participants were included in the denominator and if not we corrected abstinence rates for this. Abstinence rates and their corresponding risk ratio (95% CI) were reported at 6 and 12 months of follow up. For studies in Part 2, we extracted data on weight gain only.</P>
<P>The absolute mean (SD) difference in body weight (kg) from baseline to follow up by trial arm was used as a summary statistic for the treatment effect on weight. Mean weight change was estimated in those abstinent from smoking only.</P>
<P>In some studies mean (SD) weight change by trial arm was not reported in full. When the standard deviations for the changes in body weight were not present, we used various different methods to calculate them using standard formulas depending on the information available. This was mainly derived from confidence intervals and standard errors. To calculate standard deviations of the changes in weight from their associated confidence intervals for studies with large sample size, we used the following formula: </P>
<P>SD  = (&#8730;(n)   x  (upper limit - lower limit)) /standard error wide</P>
<P>For studies with 95% confidence intervals for difference in means we divided by 3.92 standard errors wide. If sample size was less than 60, the 3.92 standard error wide was replaced with numbers specific to both the t-distribution and the group sample size minus 1.</P>
<P>To calculate standard deviation from standard error we used the follow formula:</P>
<P>SD=SE x &#8730;(n)</P>
<P>When the absolute mean differences in body weight were not reported explicitly, we calculated them by subtracting the baseline mean weights from the post-intervention mean weights for the intervention and control groups. SDs were calculated by using an estimated correlation coefficient of 0.99, which describes how similar the baseline and finishing weight were across participants. This was estimated in abstinent smokers from raw data that we have collected from a trial to prevent weight gain on smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2009</LINK>) and from any other included studies that report standard deviations for mean weight at baseline, final measurement, and changes in means. To estimate the correlation coefficient for the intervention and control groups from other studies reporting starting and finishing means with SDs, we used the following formula:</P>
<P>r = (SD (B)2 + SD (F)2 - SD (C)2) / (2 X SD(B) X SD (F)).</P>
<P>[where r= correlation coefficient, SD= standard deviation for the changes in means, B= baseline, F= final measurement, and C= change in mean weight measurement.]</P>
<P>The imputed correlation coefficient was used to calculate the missing standard deviations for changes in means for the intervention and control groups by using the following formula:</P>
<P>SD (C) = &#8730;((SD (B)2 + SD (F)2) - (2 X r X SD (B) X SD (F))</P>
<P>Part 2 - As data have already been extracted on the participants, interventions and study quality in the Cochrane reviews included in Part 2 we extracted only data about weight gain. Weight data was extracted using the same approach as described in Part 1.</P>
<P>In some studies in Part 1 and 2, more than one trial arm had been compared with a control arm. Where appropriate, to create one comparison intervention arm we combined outcome data. For smoking we added together the numerator and denominator from each arm. Weight outcomes from more than one trial arm were calculated using the following formulas:</P>
<P>Mean<SUB>c</SUB> = ((Mean1*n1)+(Mean2*n2))/(n1+n2)<BR/>Standard deviation= &#8730;var<SUB>c</SUB>
</P>
<P>&#8730;var<SUB>c</SUB>= (sumsq<SUB>c</SUB> - (n<SUB>c</SUB> * (Mean<SUB>c</SUB>
<SUP>2</SUP>)))/(n<SUB>c</SUB>-1)</P>
<P>sumsq<SUB>c</SUB>= (((n1-1)*(var1 + ((n1/n1-1))*(mean1<SUP>2</SUP>) + ((n2-1)*(var2 + ((n2/n2-1))*(mean2<SUP>2</SUP>))</P>
<P>Key: Mean<SUB>c</SUB>= Combined mean, sumsq=sum of squares</P>
<P>For studies in Part 1, we rated the potential for bias of included trials on methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding following methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2005). This had already been performed for studies in Part 2 in the parent reviews.</P>
<P>Smoking cessation outcome data are given based on the number of quitters in the treatment and control groups divided by the total number of participants receiving treatment and reported as a risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. A risk ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more people quit in the treatment group than in the control group. Therefore, effective interventions appear to the right of the axis on the meta-analysis graph. We used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method for smoking cessation outcomes where appropriate. Weight change outcome data are given as the difference in mean weight change between the intervention and control arms and estimates were combined using the inverse variance method where appropriate. The I² statistic was used to investigate statistical heterogeneity, given by the formula [(Q-df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the chi-squared statistic and 'df' is its degrees of freedom.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions specifically designed to address post cessation weight gain</HEADING>
<P>We found 16 trials which matched our inclusion criteria for the first part of the review. Two of these studies contributed data to both Parts 1 and 2 of the review (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). All studies recruited community volunteers who wanted to stop smoking and avoid weight gain. Nine studies recruited women only (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Copeland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 Copeland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">1 Danielsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1990" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1990</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Levine-2010" TYPE="STUDY">1 Levine 2010</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Perkins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">1 Perkins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK> ) and the remainder included smokers of both sexes ( <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Norregaard-1996" TYPE="STUDY">1 Norregaard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Parsons-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Parsons 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Toll-2010" TYPE="STUDY">1 Toll 2010</LINK>). Participants averaged 20-25 cigarettes per day with the exception of four studies where mean consumption was higher at between 26-32 (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). Mean baseline weight and/or body mass index (BMI) was reported in all but three studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1990" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Toll-2010" TYPE="STUDY">1 Toll 2010</LINK>) and ranged between 64-76 kg/BMI 23-29.</P>
<P>Seven studies compared the effects of pharmacological interventions to placebo on smoking cessation and post cessation weight change. Pharmacological interventions included: 8.33 mg Phenylpropanolamine gum 16 pieces/day for 8 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>), 9 pieces/day for 2 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1990" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1990</LINK>) and up to 10 pieces/day for 4 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Klesges-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Klesges 1995</LINK>), 20 mg Ephedrine plus 200 mg caffeine 3/day for 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Norregaard-1996" TYPE="STUDY">1 Norregaard 1996</LINK>), 100, 50 and 25 mg/day Naltrexone for 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>) and 30 mg/day Dexfenfluramine for 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). This study also examined the efficacy of 40 mg/day of fluoxetine for preventing weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). As the other fluoxetine studies were included in Part 2 of the reviews, this comparison is described in Part 2.</P>
<P>Six studies assessed the effects of multi component behavioural interventions to prevent weight gain added to usual smoking cessation support. In three studies the intervention consisted of education on weight management. This was education on healthy eating, increasing physical activity and behavioural change strategies such as self monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1992</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK>). Although, one study advised all participants to reduce energy intake by 100-300kcal/day depending on how much they smoked and increase activity to one hour of walking three times a week, this was general advice given to the group and no feedback was given. (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>) gave advice appropriate to "stage of change". These have been classified as "weight management education" interventions. Three studies additionally included feedback on personal goals and a personal energy prescription (500kcal deficit of energy requirement calculated from age, gender, weight and activity level of individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Perkins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">1 Perkins 2001</LINK>) or a 150-300kcal deficit based on individuals' food diaries (food was prepared and provided to participants in this study) (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK>). These have been classified as "personalised weight management support" interventions. We considered the behavioural interventions to be compared to a "no weight intervention" arm, if participants received no intervention targeted at weight management (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK>) or if the control arm included minimal weight intervention given to appease the participants (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>, good nutrition and exercise information pack not aimed at post cessation weight gain given to participants, <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK>, last session (Wk16) spent talking about weight loss strategies, 75/107 randomised participants attended) rather than a specifically designed to have an effect.</P>
<P>One study tested the efficacy of a very low calorie diet (VLCD). In this study, participants in the intervention and control group both received the weight management education as well as usual smoking cessation support. Both groups were also advised to follow a 1600kcal diet, while the intervention group received two, two week blocks of a VLCD provided free of charge. Treatment took place in a specialist obesity treatment centre (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">1 Danielsson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address concern about weight gain is aimed at ameliorating concern and promoting abstinence, not at reducing weight gain as such, but we included these studies. <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Perkins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">1 Perkins 2001</LINK> tested the effect of CBT to promote acceptance of modest weight gain added to standard smoking cessation counselling compared to usual smoking cessation support only. <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Levine-2010" TYPE="STUDY">1 Levine 2010</LINK> tested the effect of CBT and bupropion separately and in combination added to standard smoking cessation counselling.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK> tested whether it was better to quit first then address weight gain or whether the two could occur concurrently. In this study participants, all participants received 16 weeks of smoking cessation support (target quit day,week 5) and in addition were randomised to a concurrent personalised weight management support programme (weeks 1-8) or personalised weight management support programme sequential to quitting (weeks 9-16). In the third arm participants did not receive a personalised weight management support programme but the final session focused on weight management education. 75/107 participants enrolled in the control arm were present for the final session.</P>
<P>Finally, one study compared the effect of group to individual relapse prevention follow up sessions on smoking cessation and weight change after a 2 week smoking cessation programme (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Copeland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 Copeland 2006</LINK>). As there was no control group without the weight advice, the study is not included in the meta analyses below.</P>
<P>Smoking cessation therapy was provided for all participants in all studies of pharmacological and behavioural interventions. The duration, number and format of sessions of the behavioural therapy varied from brief individual advice for two weeks to hour-long group sessions conducted over 16 weeks, but the content was similar including the following components: cognitive behavioural skills such as anticipating and planning for high risk situations, coping skills, relapse prevention and benefits of quitting smoking. In four studies all participants were also supplied with NRT (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Copeland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 Copeland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">1 Danielsson 1999</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK> two of the four comparison arms received NRT.</P>
<P>Nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Copeland-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 Copeland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">1 Danielsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1992</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Norregaard-1996" TYPE="STUDY">1 Norregaard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Perkins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">1 Perkins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Pirie 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK>) reported smoking as an outcome at six and/or 12 months. Smoking was either recorded as point prevalence (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>) or prolonged or continuous abstinence (all others). Continuous abstinence was defined as 'not a single puff since quit date'. Definitions of prolonged abstinence varied, but mainly allowed for a grace period for the two first weeks after quit day or for small lapses that did not lead to full relapse. All studies apart from one (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>) reported biochemically confirmed rates. All 15 studies reported weight gain as an outcome at end of treatment, and some reported weight at six and/or 12 months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions not specifically designed to address post cessation weight gain</HEADING>
<P>We found 53 individual trials from the lists of included studies in the parent reviews which matched our inclusion criteria for the second part of the review and had extractable data. Two of these studies also contributed data to the first part of the review (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Cooper 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Pirie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Pirie 1992</LINK> ). We included 4/11 exercise studies, 12/67 antidepressant studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Gonzales-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Gonzales 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Jorenby-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Jorenby 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Nides 2006</LINK> also appear in varenicline list), 28/133 nicotine replacement therapy studies, and 12/15 varenicline studies. We were unable to obtain published or unpublished data from the authors of any studies in the cannabinoid receptor antagonists parent review. One additional study was identified through the update search (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Pack-2008" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Pack 2008</LINK>). Participants were adult smokers who were typically volunteers from the community (although some studies recruited participants from a primary care setting and one study recruited hospitalised patients). All were motivated to quit smoking and smoked an average of 20-30 cigarettes per day. Twenty three studies reported baseline weight/BMI which was within healthy weight to slightly overweight (with mean BMI of 24-25 or mean weight no greater than 85 kg) the remaining 33 studies did not report baseline weight or BMI. As these were populations intent on smoking cessation only, they are likely to be smokers of typical body weight. One study, recruited participants based on cigarette consumption, smoking an average of 17-18 (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Shiffman-2002A" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Shiffman 2002A</LINK>) and 25-26 (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Shiffman-2002B" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Shiffman 2002B</LINK>) cigarettes per day.</P>
<P>Twelve studies from the antidepressant parent review were included in this review, three of which compared bupropion to varenicline as well as placebo and therefore also appear in the list of included studies for varenicline (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-VA-Gonzales-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 VA Gonzales 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-VA-Jorenby-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 VA Jorenby 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-VA-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 VA Nides 2006</LINK>).

One other study examined the efficacy of fluoxetine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). It was not included in the parent Cochrane review because smoking cessation at 6 months was not reported, but was identified and included here.</P>
<P>All bupropion studies administered 300 mg/day and <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Hurt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Hurt 1997</LINK> also included a 100 mg/day and 150 mg/day arm. For the main comparison, the 300 mg/day arm is used for the Hurt study and the lower dose arms are used to compare to the standard 300 mg/day treatment to the lower dose arms . Two fluoxetine studies compared two dosing levels (30 mg &amp; 60 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Niaura-2002" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Niaura 2002</LINK>) and 20 mg &amp; 40 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Saules-2004" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Saules 2004</LINK>)) which were combined for the main comparison and the lower doses and higher doses were compared in a separate comparison to examine for a dose dependent effect. One other study examined 40 mg fluoxetine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 1995</LINK>). The treatment period for all antidepressant studies ranged from seven weeks to 14 weeks with a run in to quit day of one to four weeks.</P>

<P>Weight change from baseline in all of the studies included in the second part of the review was measured in abstainers only. Definition of abstinence varied between studies as in the first part of the review and is noted in the table of characteristics of included studies. In most studies, all participants received some form of smoking cessation behavioural support in addition to the pharmacotherapy/exercise therapy and details are outlined in the table of characteristics of included studies. Some of the end of treatment data and longer term follow-up data were received through personal communication with authors and this is also noted in characteristics of included studies.</P>

<P>We extracted information about randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and measurement of abstinence and assessed the potential for bias in each domain (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). No studies were found to have used biased methods of randomisation or allocation concealment however a large proportion of studies didn't report the method of generating the random allocation sequence (31/72 studies) or allocation concealment (44/72 studies) in enough detail for likelihood of bias to be assessed. As the majority of these studies were published before the CONSORT statement guidelines were issued, it is likely that this is due to lack of reporting rather than bias. Given the nature of the behavioural interventions and exercise interventions, blinding was not possible for these studies and therefore there was some potential for bias. However, in <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Perkins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">1 Perkins 2001</LINK> participants were blinded to their allocation until after they had completed baseline information. The degree to which unblinding occurred was reported in a further two studies. <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Norregaard-1996" TYPE="STUDY">1 Norregaard 1996</LINK> found that 68% of the treatment group and 63% of the placebo group had correctly guessed their allocation to active or placebo NRT and <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Tonnesen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Tonnesen 1993</LINK> 46% on active treatment and 58% on placebo treatment guessed correctly, indicating guessing was no better than chance. A more serious potential for bias concerns the weight management interventions in the group of 'behavioural treatment' studies. Six out of the seven studies recruited women concerned about post-cessation weight gain. It is feasible that in these 'open label' studies women allocated to 'no weight help' interventions were more likely to drop out. Six studies out of all included in the review measured weight change in abstinent participants measured using point prevalence criteria. This was defined as being abstinent at the time of follow up in one study (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">1 Cooper 2005</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Cooper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Cooper 2005</LINK>) and abstinent for seven days previous to follow up in the remaining five studies (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Piper-2007" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Piper 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Rigotti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Rigotti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Fiore-1994A" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Fiore 1994A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Fiore-1994B" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Fiore 1994B</LINK>). Whether abstinence was biochemically validated or unvalidated, this was deemed as demonstrating a high risk of bias as smoking prior to the seven day period would reduce potential weight gain. Six studies were rated as being unclear in terms of bias introduced by abstinence measurement. This was because in three studies abstinence was measured as prolonged or continuous (i.e. participants need to be completely abstinent from two weeks after their quit day or from their quit day, respectively) but was not biochemically validated (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">1 O'Malley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-AD-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 AD Nides 2006</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-VA-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 VA Nides 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Lerman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Lerman 2004</LINK>), in two study the definition of abstinence was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hankey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hankey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Ehrsam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Ehrsam 1991</LINK>) and in one study although participants were only counted as abstinent if their exhaled CO levels were below 11 ppm at follow up, they were able to smoke up to three cigarettes per week (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Abelin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Abelin 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>Participants taking any type of NRT gained less weight than placebo referents at the end of treatment (MD -0.69 kg, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.51, 19 studies, I²=82%). Statistical heterogeneity was due to one study <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Abelin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Abelin 1989</LINK> which showed a 4.3 kg difference between weight gain in the treatment and control arm.

Estimates of difference in weight gain for different types of NRT were similar: gum MD -0.58 kg (95% CI -1.02 to -0.13.4 studies), patch (without Abelin 1989) MD -0.45 kg (95% CI -0.70 to -0.20, 10 studies), inhaler MD -0.37 kg (95% CI -1.19 to 0.45, two studies), sublingual tablet MD -0.48 kg (95% CI -0.99 to 0.03, 2 studies), intranasal spray (+ patch) MD 0.90 kg (95% CI -1.54 to 3.34, one study). There was some evidence that there was less weight gain at the end of treatment in participants using the lozenge compared to those using patch (MD -2.45 [-4.43, -0.47], 1 study), although this difference didn't remain in the long term. Overall, weight gain was less for those taking NRT at six and 12 months although not significantly (MD -0.37 kg, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.14, 9 studies <LINK REF="CMP-009.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.5</LINK> and MD -0.42 kg, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.08, 15 studies, <LINK REF="CMP-009.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.8</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Lerman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Lerman 2004</LINK> compared patch to spray and found no significant difference in weight gain at end of treatment or six months (<LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-009.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.5</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-12-06 15:55:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Since the first version of this review was published in 2009, we have found five additional trials and received data from the authors of a further trial fitting criteria for part 1, and there are now 16 trials of interventions specifically designed to limit post cessation weight gain. Although a range of pharmacological interventions were tested, none showed evidence that weight gain was prevented in the longer term. Behavioural interventions were more promising. Personalised weight management support, which included weight management education with both feedback on personal goals and a personal energy prescription, showed reduced weight gain at one year, but the estimate of effect was very imprecise covering both substantial benefit and a clinically irrelevant benefit. There was no evidence that detailed weight management education without personalised assessment, planning and feedback reduced weight gain and at least some evidence that this may have reduced smoking cessation rates. The earlier version of this review suggested that CBT to accept moderate weight gain increased abstinence, and limited long term post cessation weight gain however, a subsequently published trial was not as promising. When the two trials were combined, although smoking cessation rates were still significantly increased at six months, there was a significant increase in weight gain at six months, and no effects on either weight or quitting at 12 months. However, statistical heterogeneity was high. Eight new trials were identified during the update that fitted the criteria for Part 2 of this review (three bupropion studies, four varenicline studies and an NRT study that compare lozenge to gum preparations). In total, we examined evidence for five different interventions used to support smoking cessation that might incidentally reduce weight gain on cessation. There was strong evidence that four of these, NRT, bupropion, fluoxetine, and varenicline all reduced weight gain by about 0.5 kg (NRT and varenicline) and about 1 kg (fluoxetine and bupropion) by the end of the usual treatment period. A few of the trials recorded weight at later follow ups, and there was no evidence that these pharmacotherapies attenuated weight gain when assessed then but there is insufficient evidence to exclude an effect. There was some evidence that nicotine nasal spray did so at one year and it is perhaps notable that spray was available for the whole year for participants in these trials. One behavioural intervention, exercise to assist smoking cessation, showed no evidence that it reduced weight gain during the exercise programme but, perhaps surprisingly given this finding, there was evidence of reduced weight gain at one year.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacotherapy to limit weight gain</HEADING>
<P>To date, six pharmacological interventions (phenylpropanolamine (PPA), ephedrine + caffeine, naltrexone, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and chromium) have been combined with standard smoking cessation treatment to test their effect on post cessation weight gain compared with smoking cessation treatment alone. None have shown evidence of a long-term effect on weight gain and therefore none can be recommended for use in clinical practice. There was however promising evidence that PPA, dexfenfluramine, and naltrexone prevent weight gain in the short term. Dexfenfluramine has been withdrawn from use because it causes serious problems and the dose of PPA allowed for use is lower than the dose tested in these trials. Naltrexone, which is used in treatment of other substance use dependence, is promising, although the effect on weight gain is modest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural programmes to limit weight gain</HEADING>
<P>English smoking cessation guidelines from NICE make no specific recommendations about preventing post cessation weight gain, while US guidance recommends either bupropion, NRT, or exercise as interventions. A common perception is that concurrent behavioural treatment for smoking and weight undermines smoking cessation and advice is to establish smoking cessation before tackling weight (<LINK REF="REF-McEwan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwan 2006</LINK>). Some of the reason for this is the evidence from laboratory studies which show increased urges to smoke during periods of food restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Cheskin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheskin 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leeman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeman 2010</LINK>). With one possible exception, our review revealed no evidence to reinforce this fear.</P>
<P>US guidelines do not discuss the role of dietary interventions, which are the mainstay of weight control interventions in other contexts. Our review suggested that weight management programmes did not generally undermine smoking cessation. At six months no interventions showed strong evidence that cessation was reduced and at 12 months, only one intervention did. This was weight management education without personalised support. Given there was no evidence that cessation was undermined at six months, these data are hard to interpret. Nevertheless there was no evidence that this kind of non personalised weight management education reduced weight gain and such general advice cannot be recommended. The other similar but more intensive personalised weight management support programmes look the most promising of all interventions we reviewed, but the effect estimate is imprecise and requires confirmation. These interventions differed but all included personal goal setting, monitoring and feedback on progress. Other elements that may have contributed to success were degree of personalised energy restriction, or providing food to help with adherence. Although it would be possible to manipulate one element at a time, the commonalities of these data with those in the weight loss field suggest that all elements are likely to be important ingredients in the success of the intervention. It is also worth noting that the point estimates for abstinence both suggested that cessation was less likely in those receiving this intervention, though not significantly so. Further trials of this approach are required for confirmation. The other dietary approach that showed distinct promise was the VLCD. There was evidence that use early on in cessation increased abstinence in the long-term and clear evidence of a short-term reduction in weight gain and non-significant evidence of a reduction in weight at one year. In this study, the control arm was advised to adhere to a 1600kcal/day diet, which creates an energy deficit, therefore this may have masked the full effect of the VLCD in the intervention arm. However, this was one trial that advertised for participants and whether this kind of demanding intervention would be popular with many people trying to stop smoking remains to be seen.</P>
<P>Physical activity or exercise programmes were included in Part 2 of our review because they were aimed at increasing cessation. There is strong evidence that exercise reduces cravings to smoke. (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007</LINK>). In most trials of interventions in weight management, the difference between intervention and control is most marked at end of treatment and declines over follow up. In this context, it is puzzling that there was no evidence of effectiveness of exercise on weight at end of programme, but there was at 12 month follow up. This might either represent a chance finding or reflect the fact that the programme encouraged people to go on exercising after it had finished. Further evidence is required before we can be confident that physical activity programmes provide an effective intervention.</P>
<P>There is a caveat regarding the open label design of the above behavioural intervention studies. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Hall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">1 Hall 1992</LINK>, they all enrolled women who had problems with weight gain on cessation and were therefore looking to be enrolled in weight control programmes. Such participants may have been more likely to default from the control programme than when allocated the active intervention that they presumably wanted, especially in studies such as <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">1 Danielsson 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-_x0031_-Spring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">1 Spring 2004</LINK> where this included free meals. The open label design is unavoidable in this field, but it is important to note that it could bias the smoking abstinence results in favour of the intervention.  Another possible explanation of the positive result of the very low calorie diet is that it induced ketosis, which may have suppressed hunger (<LINK REF="REF-Johnstone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnstone 2008</LINK>) and nicotine withdrawal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reducing fears about weight gain through CBT</HEADING>
<P>CBT to address weight gain concerns increased weight and improved quit rates at six months, but there was no evidence of any effect at 12 months. The results of the two studies that have tested this approach varied significantly. Thus, further trials of this intervention are required before it can be recommended as a treatment programme for weight concerned smokers wanting to stop smoking.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation</HEADING>
<P>We found evidence that antidepressants, nicotine replacement therapy, and varenicline attenuate weight gain during the treatment phase, however there was insufficient evidence that the effect persisted in the longer term. The evidence suggested that for antidepressants, fluoxetine and bupropion, and for varenicline, the weight of those allocated to active intervention was the same as that for placebo in the longer term. The picture was more complicated for long term effects of NRT. The strongest effect at 12 months was seen in trials of nasal spray and inhaler, however in these trials participants were allowed to use the NRT preparation for up to a year. Taking these data together, they seem to indicate that the effect of pharmacotherapies is seen during treatment and that those who use pharmacotherapy catch up with accelerated weight gain once treatment is withdrawn. Data from within trials, <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-NRT-Sutherland-1992" TYPE="STUDY">2 NRT Sutherland 1992</LINK>, and an observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Hajek-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajek 1988</LINK>) strengthens the conclusion that the possible long-term effect of NRT depends upon long-term use. The difference in weight between long-term users and non-users was several kilograms in these studies, but little is known regarding possible adverse effects of long term use of NRT. Although we found no dose response effects in trials where participants were randomised to a higher or lower dose of NRT, there is preliminary data from records of NRT actually consumed that weight gain is associated with the dose of NRT used (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological considerations</HEADING>
<P>Several features of our review merit comment. First, we encountered studies of fluoxetine in Part 1 and Part 2 of the review. The study of fluoxetine in Part 1 was excluded from the parent Cochrane review because it did not incorporate at least a six-month follow up. It was included in the Part 1 search because the aim was to reduce weight gain. This means that it is possible that we did not include some other studies of fluoxetine that were not specifically aimed at reducing weight gain and did not incorporate a six- or 12-month follow up. There is no reason to imagine that excluding them would create a bias, however. Second, in this update but not in the original version of our review, we added <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_-VA-Tonstad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">2 VA Tonstad 2006</LINK> to our main analysis of the effect of varenicline on weight gain. In this trial, participants had taken 12 weeks of varenicline before the abstinent participants were randomised to a further 12 weeks or placebo. Thus this study examines weight gain in months three to six of a quit attempt, not months zero to three as in the other studies. We could see no strong reason to imagine that this would bias the analysis. Weight gain is less rapid in months three to six (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1998</LINK>) so, if anything, it is likely that taking varenicline would prevent less weight gain during this later period than during the former. However, the statistical significance of the result is sensitive to whether the Tonstad study is included or excluded from the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We split the behavioural interventions for weight control in part one of the review into two categories: those that provided weight management education only, and those that provided personalised weight management support. This split was chosen based on meta-analysis evidence that healthy eating and physical activity interventions combining self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory, (such as specific goal setting, feedback on progress or review of goals set) are significantly more effective than those that do not (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>As noted in the introduction, the data here relate to weight gain in abstinent smokers only. It is practically difficult to follow up non-abstinent smokers as they have no motive to attend smoking cessation clinics and thus authors do not usually provide data on continuing smokers. However, most people gain weight on cessation and most people make repeated attempts to quit. It is possible that this leads to incremental weight gain and it would be useful if data could be collected on this.</P>

<LI>Weight management education may reduce abstinence and is not effective at controlling weight and should not be used.</LI>
<LI>Personalised weight management support programmes, incorporating both feedback on personal goals and a personal energy prescription may reduce weight gain and there is no strong evidence they reduce abstinence. Further research is required to examine whether these effects can be replicated, and if the effect can be generalised to all smokers, not just those specifically concerned about gaining weight. Until then they should be used cautiously, ideally in research.</LI>
<LI>Very low calorie diets may increase abstinence and prevent weight gain in the short-term at least, but these conclusions are based on a single trial only.</LI>
<LI>The evidence showed that CBT to allay concerns about weight gain does not reduce weight gain or increase abstinence in the long term. There was significant heterogeneity between the findings of two studies of this approach.</LI>
<LI>There is mixed evidence that exercise limits post cessation weight gain but further research is required to show conclusively that it is beneficial.</LI>
<LI>Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, fluoxetine and varenicline all reduce weight gain in the short term, but patients need to be told that it is unclear whether they reduce weight gain in the long term.</LI>
<LI>The long-term effect of all combined smoking cessation and weight control interventions on weight gain is small at best, less than 1 kg, compared with the weight gain at one year (about 5 kg) and is of borderline clinical relevance. The only possible exceptions are personalised dietary and exercise interventions which may reduce this weight gain by half.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>It is important to know whether the effects of personalised weight management support programmes and very low calorie diets can be replicated and if the effect is confirmed, whether it can be generalised to all smokers trying to stop or whether the effect is specific to smokers concerned about weight gain.</LI>
<LI>Further studies of CBT to reduce weight concerns are required to clarify its effect on weight gain and smoking cessation, as the two studies carried out to date vary significantly in their estimation of effect and there was some evidence of increased weight gain at six months.</LI>
<LI>Further studies of exercise interventions are needed. The finding that an intervention aimed at increasing exercise levels had no effect initially but somehow affected weight on year later seems counterintuitive as adherence to exercise regimes usually decline rather than increase with time.</LI>
<LI>Future trials of interventions for limiting post cessation weight gain should report mean weight change, standard deviation for the weight change and the number contributing to the mean in biochemically confirmed continuous or prolonged abstinent participants only rather than in those abstinent for only one week. Weight change in those who continue to smoke should be reported separately.</LI>
<LI>Trials of current and future pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation should measure weight change, reporting mean weight change, standard deviation of the change and numbers contributing to the mean, separating abstinent from smoking participants as described above.</LI>
