<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-10 22:56:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>While younger women with early-stage, oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer are almost invariably treated with surgery plus endocrine therapy, (which deprives the cancer of the hormonal stimulus that induces its growth), women over the age of 70 years are frequently offered endocrine therapy alone. This is known as primary endocrine therapy.</P>
<P>Primary endocrine therapy using tamoxifen (a drug which blocks oestrogen receptors on the cancer cell, inhibiting its growth) was first suggested as a treatment for older women in the 1980s. Tamoxifen was given without surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy on the basis that older women are more likely to have cancers with oestrogen receptors and will therefore respond well to treatment. In addition they were thought less suitable for major surgery because of other existing health issues. However, a tumour will often only respond to this treatment for between 18 and 24 months, and those women who relapse will have to consider additional hormone treatment or opt for surgery or radiotherapy at a greater age. The long-term data suggest that, at 12 years of follow-up, more elderly women treated by primary tamoxifen alone will suffer a progression of their cancer than those who have had surgery.</P>
<P>We undertook this review to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of surgery (with or without endocrine therapy) compared with primary endocrine therapy in the treatment of operable breast cancer in women aged 70 years and over. Based on seven trials and an estimated 1081 deaths in 1571 women, the results of this review showed no benefit in respect to survival for either surgery or primary endocrine therapy. However, women who had surgery were less likely to relapse than women on primary endocrine therapy.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that surgery controls breast cancer better than tamoxifen alone in older women but does not extend survival. Both interventions were associated with adverse events. Tamoxifen-related adverse effects included hot flushes, skin rash, vaginal discharge, indigestion, breast pain, sleepiness, headache, vertigo, itching, hair loss, cystitis, acute thrombophlebitis, nausea, and indigestion. Surgery-related adverse effects included tingling or numbness on the arm on the side of the surgery, and psychosocial problems. On this basis, primary endocrine therapy should only be offered to women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours who are unfit for, or who refuse surgery. We need further trials to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of other agents such as aromatase inhibitors for use as primary endocrine therapy for an infirm older population with ER-positive tumours.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-14 10:33:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and two review authors independently extracted data from published trials. We derived hazard ratios for time-to-event outcomes, where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We extracted toxicity and quality-of-life data, where present. Where outcome data were not available, we contacted trialists and requested unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-14 20:07:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified seven eligible trials, of which six had published time-to-event data and one was published only in abstract form with no usable data. The quality of the allocation concealment was adequate in three studies and unclear in the remainder. In each case the endocrine therapy used was tamoxifen.</P>
<P>Data, based on an estimated 1081 deaths in 1571 women, did not show a statistically significant difference in favour of either surgery or primary endocrine therapy in respect of overall survival. However, there was a statistically significant difference in terms of progression-free survival, which favoured surgery with (474 participants) or without endocrine therapy (164 participants).</P>
<P>The hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival were: HR 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.20, P = 0.85; 3 trials, 495 participants) for surgery alone versus primary endocrine therapy; HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.00, P = 0.06; 3 trials, 1076 participants) for surgery plus endocrine therapy versus primary endocrine therapy. The HRs for progression-free survival were: HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.77, P = 0.0006) for surgery alone versus primary endocrine therapy; HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.81, P = 0.0001) for surgery plus endocrine therapy versus primary endocrine therapy (each comparison based on only one trial). Tamoxifen-related adverse effects included hot flushes, skin rash, vaginal discharge, indigestion, breast pain, sleepiness, headache, vertigo, itching, hair loss, cystitis, acute thrombophlebitis, nausea, and indigestion. Surgery-related adverse effects included paraesthesia on the ipsilateral arm and lateral thoracic wall in those who had axillary clearance. One study suggested that those undergoing surgery suffered more psychosocial morbidity at three months post-surgery, although this difference had disappeared by two years.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-04 13:49:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary endocrine therapy should only be offered to women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours who are unfit for surgery, at increased risk of serious surgical or anaesthetic complications if subjected to surgery, or who refuse surgery. In a cohort of women with significant co-morbid disease and ER-positive tumours it is possible that primary endocrine therapy may be a superior option to surgery. Trials are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors as primary therapy for an infirm older population with ER-positive tumours.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-14 20:42:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive breast cancer occurs when uncontrolled, abnormal growth and division of cells in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast spread to the surrounding tissue. The Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) staging system for breast cancer reflects how, when left untreated, cancer cells can spread locally to the breast tissue and the lymph glands in the armpit (Stages 1 to 3) and through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body (Stage 4). UICC Stages 1 to 3 are known as 'early breast cancer' (<LINK REF="REF-UICC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UICC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. In 2008, there were an estimated 1.38 million new cases and over 458,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2010</LINK>). Up to 30% of all breast cancers are reported to occur in the over-70 years age-group and 48% in the over-65s (<LINK REF="REF-Sader-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sader 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wanebo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanebo 1997</LINK>). An ageing population in developed countries may see these percentages increase still further (<LINK REF="REF-Silliman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silliman 1993</LINK>). However, owing to omission of the elderly from the majority of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bayer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bugeja-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bugeja 1997</LINK>), there are few data defining the optimum treatment for breast cancer in the elderly.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-10 22:59:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer in women of all ages was surgery until the late 1970s, with good results reported (<LINK REF="REF-Kesseler-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kesseler 1978</LINK>). Primary endocrine therapy was first described in the early 1980s as an alternative to standard therapy for older women (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbeer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbeer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preece-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preece 1982</LINK>). Treatment involved the sole use of a drug called tamoxifen, without surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen. It acts by blocking the oestrogen receptor (ER) in the nucleus of breast cancer cells. If oestrogen binds to these receptors, the breast cancer cells are stimulated to grow. Blocking of this receptor causes the cancer to stop growing and regress, in most cases. The majority (70%) of breast cancers have oestrogen receptors but the percentage does vary with age. Older women are much more likely to have cancers with oestrogen receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Diab-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diab 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1983</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-10 23:01:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Older women who were started on tamoxifen primary endocrine therapy in these early studies responded relatively well to the treatment. The cancer in the breast would either shrink or fail to progress in 75% of women. The treatment was well-tolerated and enabled the avoidance of complications related to surgery. This treatment option was, therefore, enthusiastically adopted by both surgeons and their elderly patients. The treatment was refined by the use of oestrogen receptor status to select those likely to respond. A good response can be expected in between 79% and 83% of women who are moderately or strongly ER-positive, compared to a 90% to 100% progression rate in those with absent ER staining (<LINK REF="REF-Gaskell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaskell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaskell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaskell 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the mean duration of response to primary endocrine therapy is only 18 to 24 months. In consequence, women who relapse are then faced with the prospect of changing to second-line hormonal therapy, surgery or radiotherapy, at a greater age, and run the risk that the disease may become inoperable. Overall, when long-term data are studied, 81% of elderly women treated by primary tamoxifen will go on to develop progression after 12 years of follow-up compared with 38% following mastectomy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kenny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 1998</LINK>). As yet, there is no clear consensus as to whether or not there is a survival advantage for tamoxifen or surgery in this age group. It would seem, on the basis of current evidence, that there is little to recommend the use of tamoxifen alone for the primary treatment of operable primary breast cancer in all but the very infirm.</P>
<P>The trend towards primary tamoxifen treatment was based on the premise that older women are less likely to be fit for surgery. The incidence of significant co-morbidity is greater in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Satariano-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 1994</LINK>), which is thought to render general anaesthesia more hazardous. However, the majority of elderly women will be fit for surgery under general anaesthesia because mastectomy, even when combined with axillary clearance, has a low morbidity and mortality. The recent UK National Mastectomy and Reconstruction Audit has demonstrated that overall the mortality for breast surgery is 0.26% (<LINK REF="REF-NHSIC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSIC 2011</LINK>). Review of articles reporting treatment specifically in the over-70 age group by wide local excision, either under local or general anaesthesia, reports only two deaths in 615 women undergoing surgery (0.3%) (<LINK REF="REF-Wyld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyld 2003</LINK>). The recent trend towards sentinel node biopsy rather than a full axillary clearance of all axillary nodes, a much less invasive operation, would further reduce the risks of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Burak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burak 2002</LINK>). In addition, even a mastectomy can usually be performed under local anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Oakley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 1996</LINK>), reducing risks still further. However, many older women may be keen to avoid surgery for diverse reasons when offered a choice of surgery or primary endocrine therapy, such as avoidance of hospitalisation, fear of mutilation, or desire to maintain independence (<LINK REF="REF-Husain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-10 23:02:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>It is difficult to assess how widespread the use of primary endocrine therapy is worldwide. It is apparently not a treatment option in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Diab-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diab 2000</LINK>) and is rarely used in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Craft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craft 2000</LINK>). In Europe, reports of primary endocrine therapy usage for the elderly vary greatly; from 3% in Italy (<LINK REF="REF-Crivellari-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crivellari 1991</LINK>), 9% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Garbay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbay 1998</LINK>), 16% in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalsen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalsen 1995</LINK>), 26% in Eire (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2002</LINK>), up to 32% in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchardy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchardy 2003</LINK>). By contrast, audits of current UK practice have confirmed that the use of primary endocrine therapy is widespread, with 42% of all women over 70 being treated in this way (<LINK REF="REF-Wyld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyld 2004</LINK>) and 55% of women over the age of 80 (<LINK REF="REF-Monypenny-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monypenny 2003</LINK>). In addition, in many of these cases there is no documentation of co-morbidity to justify its use (<LINK REF="REF-Wyld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyld 2004</LINK>). It is therefore important to establish whether this type of treatment is justifiable for older women with breast cancer and, if it is, under what circumstances.</P>

<P>Several studies had more than one publication. This 2013 review update found only new publications with updated results from already included studies.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (Allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment is regarded as particularly important in protecting against bias. We assessed and graded the quality of the randomisation processed accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>):</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Attrition bias (intention-to-treat analysis):</HEADING>
<P>We assessed and graded attrition bias as follows (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>):</P>
<P>Low risk: We analysed all participants in the treatment group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.</P>
<P>Unclear risk: We could not determine if participants were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle after contact with the authors.</P>
<P>High risk: Some participants are not analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomised because they did not receive the study intervention; they withdrew from the study; or because of protocol violation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Reporting bias:</HEADING>
<P>Owing to the limited number of studies, it was not possible to adequately assess for reporting bias using funnel plot asymmetry assessment. We therefore reviewed each study according to the appropriateness of the outcomes reported.</P>
<P>Low risk: Data were fully reported on all relevant outcomes.</P>

<P>High risk: No relevant outcomes were reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall quality assessment:</HEADING>
<P>From the quality assessment of the trials, we summarised the potential risk of bias into three categories as described by The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>):</P>
<P>Low risk of bias: plausible bias unlikely. All of the criteria met, therefore unlikely to seriously alter the results.</P>
<P>Moderate risk of bias: plausible bias. One or more criteria partly met, or one not met, which therefore raises some doubt about the results.</P>
<P>High risk of bias: plausible bias. Two or more criteria not met. Seriously weakens confidence in the results.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-04-14 10:34:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors (JM and LW) independently assembled the most complete dataset feasible.</P>
<P>1. We statistically synthesised results of eligible studies (meta-analysis).</P>
<P>2. We conducted all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>3. We conducted time-to-event analyses for time to death (survival) and time to disease progression (progression-free survival). We synthesised (meta-analysed) trial outcome data, if appropriate (i.e., there was more than one trial with similar populations, interventions and outcomes) and possible (i.e. there were adequate data). In the absence of published summary statistics (i.e., hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs)), we sought these relevant summary statistics or individual patient data from the trialists. All analyses were on an intention-to-treat principle. For time-to-event analyses, we calculated combined hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the O-E and variance methods in The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). This uses the log hazard ratio and its variance from the relevant outcome of each trial. These, in turn, we calculated using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet authored by Matt Sydes of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, which incorporates Parmar's methods for extracting summary statistics to perform meta-analyses of the published literature for survival endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We estimated the log hazard ratio and its variance by two of Parmar's hierarchy of methods depending on the availability of summary statistics. Where possible, we used the methods described in subsection 4 of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>, which estimates the variance of the log hazard ratio indirectly from the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval. If the study did not report the HR or CI, we employed the methods described in subsection 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>), which estimates the log hazard ratio and its variance from survival curves. Where event numbers were not published, we reported the 'effective number of deaths' for each arm, as calculated in the MRC spreadsheet, in the Review Manager forest plots. These estimates in no way affect the calculation of the hazard ratio and its variance and should be considered illustrative. Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> ('Source data for comparisons') records the summary statistics used for this purpose.</P>
<P>We reported ratios of treatment effects, so that HRs less than 1.0 favour surgery or surgery plus endocrine therapy, and values greater than 1.0 favour primary endocrine therapy.<BR/>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-07 23:24:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity between trial results using the Chi test and the I measurement. The Chi test assesses the amount of variation in a set of trials. Small P values suggest that there is more heterogeneity present than would be expected by chance. Chi is not a particularly sensitive test: a cut-off P value less than 0.10 is often used to indicate significance, but lack of statistical significance does not mean there is no heterogeneity. I is the proportion of variation that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Large values of I suggest heterogeneity. I values of 25%, 50%, and 75% could be interpreted as representing low, moderate, and high heterogeneity.</P>

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK>), surgical margins were inadequate by modern standards; this trial had also introduced informative censoring. All three trials had substantial competing risks, in some cases as high as 50%. In our original review, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's statisticians recommended that the potential for bias was considerable, and we present neither a meta-analysis, nor individual results from these trials. We discuss competing risks, heterogeneity of interventions and informative censoring below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Distant metastasis-free interval</HEADING>
<P>Estimates of effect were available from one published survival curve (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK>) and from anonymised individual patient data (<LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK>) for two trials. Because of heterogeneity between the two trials and competing risks within each analysis, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's statisticians recommended that the potential for bias was considerable, and we do not present a meta-analysis. Distant failure was reported as a first event in 15/82 (surgery) and 7/82 (primary endocrine therapy) women in Table 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Fentiman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fentiman 2003</LINK>, page 314); however 16/82 (surgery) and 19/82 (primary endocrine therapy) observed events were reported beneath the Kaplan-Meier curve in Figure 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Fentiman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fentiman 2003</LINK>, page 313). Therefore, this hazard ratio reported above incorporates distant metastases recorded both as a first event, and following or simultaneously with a local progression. Despite the competing risk and the issue of multiple events, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's statisticians did not oppose calculation of a hazard ratio for <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK> (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.58, P = 0.47, 164 women) from published summary statistics using the method described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. We do not present a hazard ratio for the <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK> trial because it reports only first events, since surgical margins were inadequate by modern standards, and because of informative censoring. We discuss competing risks, heterogeneity of outcome measurement and informative censoring below.</P>

<P>Limited data for subgroup analysis by oestrogen receptor status were available. In the one trial where oestrogen receptor status was positive for all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2</LINK>: 147 women), there was no significant difference between the interventions (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.32; P = 0.68). In the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GRETA" TYPE="STUDY">GRETA</LINK>: total 929 women) the oestrogen receptor status of participants was unknown.

They reported that participant age was the most important determinant of survival in later years (75 years plus). In those aged between 70 and 75 years, initial surgery (rather than primary endocrine therapy) determined survival.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Survival - breast cancer-specific</HEADING>
<P>We obtained unpublished hazard ratios for breast cancer-specific survival data from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GRETA" TYPE="STUDY">GRETA</LINK>), but were unable to conduct a subgroup meta-analysis as there were no data on the risk of a non-breast cancer-related death. A published meta-analysis of individual patient data from the <LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GRETA" TYPE="STUDY">GRETA</LINK> studies found a significant trend in favour of surgery plus endocrine therapy (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="REF-Mustacchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustacchi 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There were insufficient data to justify any quantitative analysis of this outcome. The <LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK> trial did not quantify adverse events, only reporting that one woman from the primary endocrine therapy arm had to drop out of the trial because of endocrine therapy-related adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2</LINK> did not report adverse events. In the <LINK REF="STD-GRETA" TYPE="STUDY">GRETA</LINK> trial, all participants in the surgery plus primary endocrine therapy arm who had axillary clearance had paraesthesia on the ipsilateral arm and lateral thoracic wall. Tamoxifen-related toxicity was similar between the two groups and included headache, vertigo, itching, hair loss, cystitis, vaginal bleeding, acute thrombophlebitis, nausea, and indigestion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Local disease control</HEADING>
<P>We conducted an analysis of overall effect, using hazard ratios derived from one unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK>) and one published (<LINK REF="STD-GRETA" TYPE="STUDY">GRETA</LINK>) survival curve involving two trials (929 women). This showed a significant difference in favour of surgery plus endocrine therapy (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.35, P &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity across trials (Chi 2.90, df 1, P = 0.09, I = 66%), which is discussed below. We did not include data from <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2</LINK> in this analysis, as reported results were immature compared to the other two trials.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to justify any quantitative analysis of prospectively identified subsets. However, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2</LINK>), which recruited only women with ER-positive tumours reported better local control in the surgery plus endocrine arm. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-CRC" TYPE="STUDY">CRC</LINK>) reported this outcome by type of surgery, comparing both mastectomy (52 of 225 women) and breast-conserving surgery (159 of 225) against the same population of primary endocrine therapy (230 women). The trialists reported better local disease control for both mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery than for primary endocrine therapy. Note that 14 participants in the surgery arm did not receive their planned surgery and were excluded from this subgroup analysis.</P>

At three months after start of treatment, the surgery group had more psychosocial morbidity (P = 0.03). However, there was no difference between the surgery and primary endocrine therapy groups at two years (<LINK REF="REF-Fallowfield-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallowfield 1994</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-04-14 10:36:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-16 22:35:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>This study has demonstrated that primary endocrine therapy is inferior to surgery with endocrine therapy for the local control of breast cancer in ER-unselected, medically fit older women. It is also independent of the type of surgery, with both mastectomy and wide excision (without adjuvant radiotherapy) achieving superior local control. However, surgical treatment does not result in significantly better overall survival.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-10 23:38:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The results of this review need to be read bearing in mind that they are derived from a small number of individually underpowered studies. Additionally, there are four areas where treatment regimens in the trials do not necessarily coincide with modern clinical practice. Therefore, the appropriateness of the following should be questioned: (1) endocrine therapy for women with ER-negative tumours; (2) surgery without adjuvant endocrine therapy; (3) primary endocrine therapy where the individual is fit for and agreeable to surgery; (4) new endocrine therapies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Oestrogen receptor status</HEADING>
<P>Most of the included trials recruited women regardless of oestrogen receptor status. However, only 85% to 90% of women in this age group have ER-positive tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Diab-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diab 2000</LINK>). For those with ER-negative tumours, endocrine therapy was not an active intervention and such treatment is not in line with modern clinical practice.</P>
<P>Their inclusion may also have biased the results of the meta-analysis, although the extent is difficult to assess. Had women with ER-negative tumours been excluded from the studies (which would have been a fairer comparison), the primary endocrine therapy arm might have performed better against the surgery plus endocrine therapy arm, although it is unlikely that the considerable local control advantage conferred by surgery would be overcome. Only <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2</LINK>, a trial comparing surgery with adjuvant endocrine therapy against endocrine therapy alone, recruited exclusively participants with ER-positive tumours. Local control was inferior in the primary endocrine therapy group despite this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Surgery without adjuvant endocrine therapy</HEADING>
<P>Three of the trials included in this study (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK>) did not include adjuvant endocrine therapy after surgery. However, it is considered best practice today for women with ER-positive tumours to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy in addition to surgery (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). The results of this study showed no difference in overall survival where surgery alone was compared with primary endocrine therapy (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20, P = 0.85). Where surgery and adjuvant endocrine therapy were compared to primary endocrine therapy, the direction of effect favoured surgery; however, this was only of borderline significance (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00, P = 0.06). As discussed above, it is possible that selection of ER-positive women might improve the relative effectiveness of primary endocrine therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Co-morbidity</HEADING>
<P>Primary endocrine therapy for the treatment of operable breast cancer in older women is still in widespread use in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-BCCOM-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCCOM 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monypenny-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monypenny 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyld 2004</LINK>); however, the populations represented in the included studies may not be typical of those who receive such treatment today. The women recruited to these studies were, by definition, fit for surgery and therefore their life expectancy would have been good (<LINK REF="REF-Exterman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Exterman 2000</LINK>) and the surgical risks low. The reality of current practice in many units in the UK is to restrict primary endocrine therapy to those women in whom the risks of surgery are high or who would be expected to have a reduced life expectancy because of co-morbid diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Wyld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyld 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is worth noting that none of the included studies controlled for participant co-morbidity, which has a significant influence on survival in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-Satariano-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 1994</LINK>). Thus we see that breast cancer-specific survival is improved in those randomised to surgery plus endocrine therapy compared to those on primary endocrine therapy (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95: <LINK REF="REF-Mustacchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustacchi 1998</LINK>). As already noted, difference in overall survival still favours the surgery arm but is only of borderline significance. This serves to emphasise that, even among those fit for surgery in this age group, a significant proportion of participants still die of co-morbid diseases, so reducing the relative advantages of any breast cancer therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Satariano-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) Different endocrine therapies</HEADING>
<P>In each included study the endocrine therapy used was tamoxifen, an oestrogen-receptor antagonist. Since these studies were designed, new endocrine therapies for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer have become available. These are the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Letrozole has been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting (<LINK REF="REF-Eiermann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eiermann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2011</LINK>) and in the metastatic setting (<LINK REF="REF-Mouridsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouridsen 2003</LINK>). Anastrazole is superior to tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting (<LINK REF="REF-ATAC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATAC 2005</LINK>). It is possible that primary endocrine therapy using these newer agents may be even more attractive for older women who are unfit for surgery. This hypothesis should be tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), although a recent attempt to run a multicentre UK RCT comparing surgery plus an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor versus primary endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor failed to recruit, due to women refusing randomisation and preferring to make their own choice of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-10 23:42:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>In some cases, the internal validity of the included trials was affected by competing risks and informative censoring. Heterogeneity between trials, in terms of interventions and outcome assessment, also made the review team's assessment of some outcomes difficult.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Competing risks</HEADING>
<P>The calculation of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) probabilities assumes that failure from local recurrence is still possible beyond the time of censoring. For those participants who failed from other causes (e.g., death without failing) this is called the 'competing risk'. Censoring participants who fail from competing risks is not appropriate as it gives an underestimate of the probability of local failure by treating those cases who have not failed locally and are alive the same as those who have not failed locally but have died. This approach is clearly undesirable.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that none of the trials adjusted for competing risks when calculating local disease control, Cochrane Breast Cancer Group statisticians advised us that the Kaplan-Meier plots and estimates of the hazard ratio would be more likely to be valid if the following conditions were met:<BR/>(a) the rate of deaths without breast cancer recurrence (not necessarily the same as non-breast cancer-related death) was similar and accounted for a small percentage of the deaths in both arms (maybe less than 10%); and,<BR/>(b) the duration over which deaths without recurrence were happening was roughly the same (the competing risk of deaths is uniform over the two arms across the follow-up period).<BR/>In none of the trials can we be sure that these conditions are met. Therefore, the results in the trial reports for this outcome must be read with caution. Not only should these trials not be meta-analysed but Cochrane Breast Cancer Group statisticians advise us it would be inappropriate to further disseminate their results for this particular outcome, as it represents a potentially misleading estimate of effect. The same issue arises with distant metastasis-free interval for the surgery alone versus primary endocrine therapy comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Informative censoring</HEADING>
<P>The Kaplan-Meier methods used to calculate time to local or distant recurrence assume that censoring is non-informative, i.e., that the fact that a person is censored at a given time is independent of their potential outcome. In the <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK> trial, participants are censored at the time of the last clinical examination. If we assume that those who have progressed are more likely to attend follow-up clinics and that those who are disease- or metastases-free are less likely to attend clinics, the latter group will be censored earlier, and will stop contributing information to the study. Thus the censoring is potentially dependent on the likelihood of disease progression (i.e., related to the outcome). This is another source of potential bias, as the rate of censoring does not leave a representative sample of those at risk. Therefore Cochrane Breast Cancer Group statisticians advised us that the censoring is likely to be informative and the assumption of non-informative censoring required for the KM method is likely to be violated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Heterogeneity of interventions</HEADING>
<P>For the surgery alone versus primary endocrine therapy comparison, there was heterogeneity between trials in terms of interventions. One study (<LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK>) included larger (T3 and T4) tumours in the surgical arm, which would result in an increased local recurrence rate. The other two trials included only participants with T1 - T2 (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1</LINK>) and T1 - T3a (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK>) tumours respectively. The <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK> study treated 64 women with wide local excision and 36 with mastectomy; in the <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK> trials all women were treated with mastectomy. It is arguable, therefore, that <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK> is different enough in terms of its populations and interventions to make statistical synthesis with the other two studies inappropriate. Nevertheless, both the populations and interventions of all included studies are in conformity with the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) Heterogeneity of outcome assessments</HEADING>
<P>For the surgery-alone versus primary endocrine therapy comparison, there was a difference between the definitions of distant metastasis-free interval between the two trials: in <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10851" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10851</LINK> they have counted some distant events which occurred after local events; in <LINK REF="STD-St-Georges" TYPE="STUDY">St Georges</LINK> they have only counted first events. This made it inappropriate to combine the outcomes from the two trials. For the surgery plus endocrine therapy versus primary endocrine therapy comparison, evidence of heterogeneity between trials was identified for local disease control; funnel plots were not practical, with only two included trials, and the reasons must remain speculative. It is possible that here too there is a difference between each trial's outcome definitions in terms of whether only first events were counted.</P>

<P>1. Types of outcome measures - We have made an amendment to the second primary outcome to make clear that the event numbers for the outcome progression-free survival include both cancer progression and death events from any cause.<BR/>
<BR/>The protocol originally read:<BR/>"disease-free survival (interval between start of treatment and need for second line treatment/palliative treatment/recurrence)"<BR/>
<BR/>It now reads:<BR/>"progression-free survival (interval between start of treatment and need for second line treatment/palliative treatment/ recurrence/death from any cause)"<BR/>
<BR/>This has been modified to allay confusion between trials which record disease-free survival (which counts death as an event) and disease-free interval (which does not). The outcome we had originally defined (the text in brackets) was 'disease-free interval'. We had created the potential for confusion by then calling the outcome disease-free survival as they are different outcomes.</P>
