<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-06 13:46:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that moxibustion may be useful for turning babies from breech presentation (bottom first) to cephalic presentation (head first) for labour when used with either acupuncture or postural techniques of knee to chest or lifting buttocks while lying on the side. </P>
<P>Breech presentation of babies is common in the second trimester of pregnancy but most babies turn themselves before the onset of labour; some do not. A baby coming bottom first can have more difficulty being born, which causes trauma to the mother. A vaginal birth has to be planned or a caesarean section may be suggested. Moxibustion is a type of Chinese medicine that may be helpful in turning a breech baby. It involves burning a herb close to the skin at an acupuncture point on the little toe to produce a warming sensation. This review found eight randomised controlled trials involving 1346 women. Women randomly assigned to moxibustion had daily to twice weekly treatment at between 28 and 37 weeks. In one trial adverse events relating to treatment included an unpleasant odour (with or without throat irritation), nausea and abdominal pain from contractions. The included trials were of moderate methodological quality, sample sizes in some of the studies were small, how the treatment was applied differed and reporting was limited. While the results were combined they should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in the included studies. More evidence is needed concerning the benefits and safety of moxibustion.</P>

<P>Six new trials have been added to this updated review. One trial has been moved to studies awaiting classification while further data are being requested. This updated review now includes a total of eight trials (involving 1346 women). Meta-analyses were undertaken (where possible) for the main and secondary outcomes. Moxibustion was not found to reduce the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth compared with no treatment (P = 0.45). Moxibustion resulted in decreased use of oxytocin before or during labour for women who had vaginal deliveries compared with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.60). Moxibustion was found to result in fewer non-cephalic presentations at birth compared with acupuncture (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.72). When combined with acupuncture, moxibustion resulted in fewer non-cephalic presentations at birth (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94), and fewer births by caesarean section (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98) compared with no treatment. When combined with a postural technique, moxibustion was found to result in fewer non-cephalic presentations at birth compared with the postural technique alone (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56).</P>

<P>This review found limited evidence to support the use of moxibustion for correcting breech presentation. There is some evidence to suggest that the use of moxibustion may reduce the need for oxytocin. When combined with acupuncture, moxibustion may result in fewer births by caesarean section; and when combined with postural management techniques may reduce the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth, however, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate moxibustion for breech presentation which report on clinically relevant outcomes as well as the safety of the intervention.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-22 20:10:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breech presentation is common in the mid trimester of pregnancy, with the incidence of breech decreasing as the pregnancy approaches term. The incidence of breech presentation at term is reported to be 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Cruikshank-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruikshank 1986</LINK>). Breech presentation may arise from placenta praevia, multiple gestation, uterine abnormalities, poor uterine tone, prematurity or unknown causes, and is associated with primigravidae, older mothers, small-for-gestational-age babies and female babies (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>External cephalic version (ECV), where the position of the baby is manipulated through the mother's abdominal wall to be head down, is a safe and effective method of reducing the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth and the need for caesarean section when performed after 36 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002a</LINK>). The benefits from ECV at term have been demonstrated in a Cochrane review reporting a 62% reduction in the chance of non-cephalic birth and a 45% reduction in caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002a</LINK>). Complications of ECV are reported to be rare, however, there is insufficient evidence to assess the complications.</P>
<P>The birth of a baby with breech presentation is usually by planned vaginal delivery or planned caesarean section, with trends toward caesarean section compared with planned caesarean section for women with a breech presentation. A large randomised trial reported poor perinatal outcome and neonatal morbidity from a planned vaginal birth after breech presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>), however, there was no difference in the risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay for babies who were assessed at two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-22 20:13:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is increasing interest in exploring complementary medicine during pregnancy and towards labour. Moxibustion (a treatment method of traditional Chinese medicine) involves the burning of a herb (<I>Artemisia vulgaris</I>) close to the skin to induce a warming sensation (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1991</LINK>). Anecdotal evidence suggests that moxibustion to the acupuncture point Bladder 67 (BL67) (Chinese name <I>Zhiyin</I>), located at the tip of the fifth toe, may correct breech presentation (<LINK REF="STD-Cardini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cardini 1991</LINK>). Women with a breech presentation may seek treatment with moxibustion from 32 to 38 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-West-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2003</LINK>). Moxa sticks have been shown to emit primarily long-wavelength infrared radiation (IR-C) indicating that moxa mainly affects the superficial skin, where heat receptors are located (<LINK REF="REF-Pach-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pach 2009</LINK>). Due to the limited skin penetration of IR-C moxa sticks, thermal effects on internal organs are more likely to arise from reflex mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2009</LINK>). It has been suggested that this technique stimulates the production of maternal hormones (placental oestrogens and prostaglandin), and encourages the lining of the uterus to contract which in turn stimulates fetal activity (<LINK REF="REF-Cooperative-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooperative 1984</LINK>), although the mechanism of action has not yet been determined. This technique involves holding moxa sticks (1.5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length) or burning moxa cones on or over BL67 on both toes. The heat felt should be warm but not uncomfortable. Treatment regimens vary and there is no consensus on the best regimen, but moxibustion may be administered for 15 to 20 minutes, from one to 10 times daily, for up to 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-Budd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ewies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewies 2002</LINK>). The literature suggests this technique is best conducted preterm (between 28 and 37 weeks). There have been no side-effects reported. It has been suggested that the smoke generated while burning moxa may irritate the respiratory tract, although there is no evidence to support this. The effect of in utero exposure to moxa smoke is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Ewies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewies 2002</LINK>). There is also a risk of blistering the skin with moxibustion; however, due attention reduces this risk significantly, especially when it is applied by an appropriately trained professional.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-22 18:56:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effect of moxibustion is proposed to be associated with the chemical and thermal stimulation from the burning of moxa. The procedure is thought to stimulate the production of placental oestrogens and prostaglandin, encouraging fetal activity through contraction of the lining of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-West-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-22 20:15:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To reduce the incidence of breech presentation at term, several techniques have been used to correct the presentation prior to term. Current management options include external cephalic version (ECV; external rotation of the baby to cephalic presentation) and postural management (maternal movements involving knee to chest exercises or pelvic elevation). External cephalic version is usually performed at or after 37 weeks and appears to reduce the chance of breech births and caesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Postural techniques are often suggested by doctors and midwives to promote version of the baby. A Cochrane review found no benefit of postural management on presentation and method of delivery and perinatal outcome, although it acknowledged that the numbers of women included in studies to date were small (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002b</LINK>). Increasingly, women are looking at other forms of health care to complement their pregnancy care. Moxibustion is one such modality.</P>
<P>In 2005 we published the first version of this systematic review. Since that time, new trials have been published. This review examined the evidence supporting the use of moxibustion for breech presentation both preterm and at term.</P>

<P>Due to the nature of the intervention and types of participants, it is unlikely that a cross-over or cluster-randomised trial has been performed. However, in the event that this occurred, cross-over trials would be subject to within-subject analysis. If cluster-randomised trials were identified, we planned in the analyses to adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we used ICCs from other sources, we would report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials were identified, we planned to synthesise the relevant information.

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). Where moxibustion was used in combination with another intervention, a separate comparison was made due to incompatibility of the interventions. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects would differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-22 21:42:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While six new trials have been included in this updated review, overall, there are few high-quality trials evaluating the role of moxibustion to promote cephalic presentation. Moxibustion resulted in a decreased use of oxytocin compared with no treatment, and a reduction in the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth compared with acupuncture. When combined with acupuncture, moxibustion resulted in a reduction in the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth and the number of births by caesarean section compared with no treatment. When combined with postural techniques, moxibustion was found to reduce the number of non-cephalic presentations compared with the postural technique alone. However, the results must be interpreted with caution due to clinical heterogeneity (including differences in interventions, sample size, and study populations), and varying levels of statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-06 16:33:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the included studies reported on the primary outcome, while few studies reported on the secondary outcomes. The included studies have investigated the use of moxibustion in correcting a breech presentation in a variety of settings and from a variety of locations. Differences in the intervention (frequency, duration, and used alone, or in combination with acupuncture or postural techniques), as well as compliance, highlight the variation in current clinical practice internationally, as well as cultural differences in the acceptability of the intervention.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-03 11:43:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included eight trials, involving 1346 women. The included trials were of moderate methodological quality, however, sample sizes in some studies were small, differences existed in interventions, and reporting was limited. For higher quality trials, differences in study design were noted, and results of meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-09-21 23:15:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A potential source of bias of this review may originate from the search strategy. The search strategy utilised is more likely to detect English language publications. Efforts have been made to identify publications in languages other than English (e.g. Chinese), however, it is possible that relevant publications have not been identified.</P>

<P>The findings from this review differ from other evidence. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Vas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vas 2009</LINK> found moxibustion to be beneficial in correcting non-vertex presentation, although the authors acknowledged considerable heterogeneity was detected. A systematic review of moxibustion and other acupuncture point stimulation methods to correct breech presentation by <LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK> found moxibustion to be effective in correcting breech presentations. The review included both randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-06 16:34:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-06 16:34:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that moxibustion may reduce the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth, either alone or in combination with acupuncture or postural techniques. When used in combination with acupuncture, moxibustion may result in fewer births by caesarean section. Moxibustion may also be useful in decreasing women's use of oxytocin (compared with no treatment). There is some evidence that moxibustion combined with postural techniques (knee-chest therapy, and LBSL) may reduce the number of non-cephalic presentations at birth. Further evidence is needed to confirm (or refute) benefit for correcting breech presentation. Practitioners should ensure appropriate ventilation is available when performing moxibustion, to reduce the respiratory adverse events reported with the procedure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-19 03:07:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for robust, methodologically sound, randomised controlled trials of adequate statistical power to evaluate this intervention. Clinically relevant outcome measures such as mode of birth, perinatal morbidity and mortality, maternal complications and maternal satisfaction must be reported, as well as any adverse events related to moxibustion. Parity, gestational age at time of intervention and ethnicity should also be included in analyses. Consideration should also be given to the timing of the intervention, and strategies to ensure compliance with treatment. As it is not currently feasible to blind participants to group allocation with moxibustion, a trial comparing moxibustion with external cephalic version or postural management may be appropriate. Future trials should report on safety and women's views of the intervention, and explore the number, frequency and length of treatments.</P>

<P>260 women were randomised to the trial in Jiangxi province, China. Inclusion criteria were primigravidae, at 33 weeks' gestation, breech presentation diagnosed by ultrasound, normal fetal biometry. Exclusion criteria were pelvic defects, previous uterine surgery, uterine malformation, fibromyoma greater than 4 cm diameter, fetal malformation, twin gestation, tocolytic therapy during pregnancy, risk of premature birth, pathological pregnancy that contraindicated inclusion in the trial e.g. intrauterine growth retardation, gestosis, serious infections, placenta praevia, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-21 23:17:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>All women had breech presentation confirmed by ultrasound in the 33rd week of gestation, within 24 hours of randomisation. All women were asked to record fetal movements once daily for 7 days, during a 1-hour period. The first 87 women randomised to the treatment group were instructed to administer moxibustion to BL67 bilaterally once daily for 30 minutes (15 minutes each side) for 7 days, while the subsequent 43 women were instructed to administer moxibustion twice daily for 30 minutes (15 minutes per side). Participants were given an instruction session on how to administer the moxibustion. After 7 days fetal position was checked via fetal heartbeats and abdominal palpation, with ultrasound being used only when the other techniques were uncertain. If version had not occurred, women were advised to continue another week of treatment providing the woman agreed, and there were no adverse effects. Women with breech presentation at 35 weeks could undergo ECV.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcomes were the number of cephalic presentations at the 35th week and at birth, and fetal motor activity. Secondary outcomes included compliance with treatment, observation of possible adverse effects in the intervention group and adverse events in both groups, number of cephalic versions with 2 different dosages of moxibustion, number and causes of caesarean deliveries, spontaneous and induced deliveries, and Apgar score at 5 minutes.</P>

Due to the small numbers of studies identified through the electronic searches it was possible to review the results of each line, for example, we reviewed all the results of lines 7 to 16 in the MEDLINE and AMED search and lines 9 to 12 in the EMBASE search.</P>

<P>We evaluated the appropriateness of trials for inclusion. Where there was uncertainty about inclusion of the study, the full text was retrieved. We contacted the original author for further information if necessary. If there was disagreement between authors about the studies to be included that could not be resolved by discussion, we sought assistance from the third reviewer. Reasons for excluding trials were stated.</P>
<P>Following an assessment for inclusion, we assessed the methodology of the trial. We extracted the data onto hard copy data sheets. Meaghan Coyle and Caroline Smith extracted the data and assessed quality.</P>
<P>We assessed included trials according to the following five main criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>adequate concealment of treatment allocation (e.g. opaque/sealed numbered envelopes, sequentially numbered envelopes, central randomisation);</LI>
<LI>adequate method of allocation to treatment (e.g. by computer randomisation, random number tables, lot drawing, coin tossing, shuffling cards, throwing dice);</LI>
<LI>adequate documentation of how exclusions were handled after treatment allocation - to facilitate intention-to-treat analysis;</LI>
<LI>adequate blinding of outcome assessment (e.g. outcome assessor and data analyst blinded); and</LI>
<LI>losses to follow up (trials with losses greater than 25% will be excluded from the analysis).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We assigned quality scores to each trial, using the criteria described in section six of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>).<BR/>(A) was used to indicate a trial which has a high level of quality in which all the criteria are met;<BR/>(B) was used to indicate that one or more criteria were partially met or if it is unclear if all the criteria were met; and<BR/>(C) was used if one or more criteria were not met.</P>
<P>In addition, we assigned quality scores to each trial for completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome assessment as follows:<BR/>For completeness of follow up:<BR/>(A) less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(D) 20% or more of participants excluded; and<BR/>(E) unclear.</P>
<P>For blinding of assessment outcome:<BR/>(A) double blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated group;<BR/>(B) single blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation, or the trial is described as double blind but side-effects of one or other treatment meant that it is likely that for a significant proportion (7% to 20%) of participants could correctly identify their treatment allocation;<BR/>(C) no blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment; and<BR/>(D) unclear.</P>
<P>We entered data directly from the published reports into the Review Manager 4.2 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2002</LINK>) with double data entry performed by the co-author (Caroline Smith). Where data were not presented in a suitable format for data entry, or if data were missing, we sought additional information from the trialists by personal communication in the form of a letter or telephone call.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the interventions, double blinding of assessments was not possible; therefore, we considered for inclusion studies where there was no double blinding of assessments. An intention-to-treat analysis would have enhanced the quality of the trial but was not present in all retrieved trials. We included only studies in which data were reported by allocated group. Where moxibustion was used in combination with another intervention, a separate comparison was made due to incompatibility of the interventions. We performed statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2002</LINK>). For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals calculated. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic was used to detect statistical heterogeneity, with a score of greater than 50% indicating significant heterogeneity.</P>
