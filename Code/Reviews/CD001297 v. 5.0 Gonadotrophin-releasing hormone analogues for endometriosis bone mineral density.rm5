<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:50:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">Both hormone replacement therapy and danazol stop the loss of bone density that occurs when women take gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues for endometriosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Endometriosis is a painful condition caused where tissue from the lining of the uterus (womb) is outside the uterus as well. It can be treated with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). Possible adverse effects of GnRHas include loss of bone density, loss of sex-drive and hot flushes. The decrease in bone density is particularly important because it increases the risk of osteoporosis. The review found that taking hormone replacement therapy with GnRHas can prevent this adverse effect. Danazol can also prevent loss of bone density, but adverse effects of danazol can include acne, weight gain and headaches.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) are generally well tolerated, and are effective in relieving the symptoms of endometriosis (Prentice 2003). Unfortunately the low oestrogen state that they induce is associated with adverse effects including an acceleration in bone mineral density (BMD) loss. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) on the bone mineral density of women with endometriosis, compared to placebo, no treatment, or other treatments for endometriosis, including GnRHas with add-back therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of controlled trials (23rd October 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2002). We also carried out electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 - March Week 2 2003) and EMBASE (1980 - March Week 2 2003). We also searched the reference lists of articles and contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Prospective, randomised controlled studies of the use of GnRHas for the treatment of women with endometriosis were considered, where bone density measurements were an end point. The control arm of the studies was either placebo, no treatment, another medical therapy for endometriosis, or GnRHas with add-back therapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers (JF and MS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty studies involving 2,391 women were included, however only 15, involving 910 women, could be included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that danazol and progesterone + oestrogen add-back are protective of BMD at the lumbar spine both during treatment and for up to six and twelve months after treatment, respectively. Between the groups receiving GnRHa and the groups receiving danazol/gestrinone, there was a significant difference in percentage change of BMD after six months of treatment, the GnRH analogue producing a reduction in BMD from baseline and danazol producing an increase in BMD (SMD -3.43, 95 % CI -3.91 to -2.95). Progesterone only add-back is not protective; after six months of treatment absolute value BMD measurements of the lumbar spine did not differ significantly from the group receiving GnRH analogues (SMD 0.15, 95 % CI -0.21 to 0.52). In the comparison of GnRHa versus GnRHa + HRT add-back, that is oestrogen + progesterone or oestrogen only, there was a significantly bigger BMD loss in the GnRHa only group (SMD -0.49, 95 % CI -0.77 to -0.21). These numbers reflect the absolute value measurements at the lumbar spine after six months of treatment. Due to the small number of studies in the comparison we are unable to conclude whether calcium-regulating agents are protective. No difference was found between low and high dose add-back regimes but again only one study was identified for this comparison. Only one study comparing GnRH analogues with placebo was identified, but the study gave no data. No studies comparing GnRH with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or progestagens were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Both danazol and progesterone + oestrogen add-back have been shown to be protective of BMD, while on treatment and up to six and 12 months later, respectively. However, by 24 months of follow-up there was no difference in BMD in those women who had HRT add-back. Studies of danazol versus GnRHa did not report long-term follow-up. The significant side effects associated with danazol limit its use. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 12:17:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition, affecting an unknown proportion of pre-menopausal women. Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue, which is normally only found in the lining of the womb, appears in other parts of the body, such as the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, pelvis and bowel. The condition is oestrogen-dependent, and while the removal of both ovaries has long been known to provide permanent relief of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-1925" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 1925</LINK>), in women of child-bearing potential, this is often not an acceptable option. Medical therapies, therefore, aim to have the same effect as removing the ovaries, but in a reversible fashion, with the aim of reducing circulating levels of oestrogens, allowing the endometriotic deposits to become inactive, and alleviating symptoms.</P>
<P>One of the treatments for endometriosis is gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), which work by inducing a temporary menopause-like state, with very low levels of circulating oestrogens. GnRH analogues are generally well tolerated by women and are effective agents for relieving the symptoms of endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2003</LINK>). Although generally well tolerated, some women experience adverse effects such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness and loss of libido due to the oestrogen deficiency. Unfortunately, one of the other side-effects of low oestrogen levels is an acceleration of bone mass loss, as seen following the menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Nilas-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilas 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christiansen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christiansen 1993</LINK>). This is significant as it could put these women at increased risk of fractures or developing osteoporosis. Oestrogen in pre-menopausal women prevents resorption of calcium from the bones, maintaining bone mineral density. Once oestrogen levels are lowered at the time of menopause, either natural or induced, this protective effect is lost, and the loss of bone density accelerates. Other treatments for endometriosis also reduce oestrogen levels, and there is some evidence that some of them have a similar effect on bone density, for example medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera) (<LINK REF="REF-Cundy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cundy 1991</LINK>). Danazol has some androgenic properties, which help to conserve bone density, as do other therapies, such as norethisterone and gestrinone. However, the significant androgenic side effects (for example hirsutism and acne) and adverse effects on lipid profile associated with danazol limit its usefulness as a first line treatment for endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Selak-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selak 2003</LINK>). Common side effects of danazol use are weight gain, acne, hirsutism, oily skin and hair, myalgia (muscle pain) and headache (<LINK REF="STD-Henzl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henzl 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>There has been some debate that the bone density of women with endometriosis who are not being treated is less than that of their healthy counterparts. However, with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="REF-Comite-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comite 1989</LINK>), this has not been shown to be the case (<LINK REF="STD-Dodin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dodin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1991</LINK>). Lane compared 85 women with laparoscopically proven endometriosis with 52 women who were of a similar age, had regular menstrual cycles, and no major medical problems. No differences were found between the bone mineral density of the two groups. Dodin compared 26 women with endometriosis with 26 similar, healthy women, and again found no difference in their bone mineral densities. It would seem reasonable to suppose, therefore, that if the bone density of women with endometriosis is found to have decreased after a course of treatment for endometriosis, it is a side-effect of the treatment that is the cause, rather than the disease itself. </P>
<P>In recent years, so-called "add-back" therapy has been used to alleviate the side effects of GnRH analogues, which are both temporary, for example hot flushes, loss of libido (sex drive), and possibly permanent -i.e. the loss of bone density. Add-back therapy means adding hormones or non-hormonal substances to the GnRHa treatment in order to avoid some of these side effects caused by the GnRHa-induced suppression of oestrogen. Hormones used as add-back are progesterone alone, oestrogen alone or a combination of oestrogen and progesterone. Examples of non-hormonal add-back regimes are vitamin D, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The dosage, duration and type of add-back therapy varies. It is often in the form of hormone replacement therapy, but there have also been studies of GnRH analogues in combination with various agents influencing calcium metabolism in bones. This review seeks to examine the effects on bone density of GnRH analogues treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of GnRH analogues on the bone mass density of women with endometriosis, we have tested the following hypotheses</P>
<P>1. That treatment with GnRH analogues causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>2. That treatment with GnRH analogues causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than treatment with danazol</P>
<P>3. That treatment with GnRH analogues causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than treatment with progestagens.</P>
<P>4. That treatment with GnRH analogues causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than treatment with the oral contraceptive pill.</P>
<P>5. That treatment with GnRH analogues alone causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than treatment with GnRH analogues plus hormone replacement therapy.</P>
<P>6. That treatment with GnRH analogues causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than treatment with GnRH analogues plus calcium-regulating agents.</P>
<P>7a. That administration of GnRH analogues intramuscularly causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than if they were administered sub-cutaneously.</P>
<P>7b. That administration of GnRH analogues sub-cutaneously causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than if they were administered intra-nasally.</P>
<P>7c. That administration of GnRH analogues intramuscularly causes a greater loss of bone mineral density than if they were administered intra-nasally.</P>
<P>8. That the bone density loss in women treated with GnRH analogues is reversible once treatment has finished.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All prospective, randomised controlled studies comparing GnRH analogues with placebo, no treatment or other medical therapies for the treatment of women with endometriosis were considered for inclusion. Open studies as well as double-blind studies were considered, since it is difficult to blind either investigators or participants when GnRHa treatment causes menstrual periods to stop, while placebo, or another treatment may not. Studies including participants being treated for a mixed group of benign gynaecological conditions were included providing that the group of women contained some with endometriosis and that the treatment regimen was consistent across groups and was treatment aimed at the management of endometriosis.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Premenopausal women suffering from endometriosis diagnosed visually by laparoscopy or laparotomy, or presumptively, from symptom history.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues versus placebo, no treatment, danazol, progestagens, the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), GnRH analogues plus hormonal or non-hormonal add-back, and GnRH analogues plus calcium-regulating agents were considered. Trials comparing GnRH analogues given by different administration routes were also considered. Only trials where the treatment period exceeded six months were considered for inclusion. The reason for this decision is that shorter treatment periods do not seem to treat the disease effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Audebert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audebert 1998</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The objective measurement of bone density was considered. Any method of measurement was considered - methods used to measure bone mineral density are dual-energy photon absorptiometry (DPA), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) single-energy photon absorptiometry (SPA), single-energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Measurements taken at the lumbar spine and femoral head were considered, whilst those at the distal forearm were excluded because here measurements are of cortical bone which is less affected by GnRHa therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehouse-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehouse 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1990</LINK>). Bone density measurements at the end of treatment and in the follow-up period were included. Measurements were grouped according to the anatomical location of measurements and the timing of measurements.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The review drew on the search strategy developed for the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility group. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of controlled trials (23rd October 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2002). We also carried out electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 - March week 2, 2003) and EMBASE (1980 - March week 2, 2003).</P>
<P>The following Medical Subject headings (MeSH terms) and all combinations of these words were used: terms included endometriosis, bone mineral density, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue, buserelin, goserelin, leuprorelin, leuprolide, triptorelin, nafarelin and add-back therapy. </P>
<P>We also searched the reference lists of articles and contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 12:17:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>SELECTION OF STUDIES<BR/>The review was undertaken by two reviewers (JF and MS). The search strategy described previously was employed to obtain titles, and, where possible, abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened by JF and MS, who discarded studies that were clearly ineligible but aimed to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Copies of the full articles were obtained. Both reviewers independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by referring to an expert in the field (Professor C. Farquhar) for discussion. Further information was sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.</P>
<P>RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT<BR/>The risk of bias all studies that were deemed eligible for the review was then assessed independently by the two reviewers, with discrepancies being resolved as above. The quality of allocation concealment was graded as either adequate (A), unclear (B) or inadequate (C), following the detailed descriptions of these categories provided by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Other aspects of study quality, including the extent of blinding, whether the groups were comparable at baseline, the extent of losses to follow-up, non-compliance and whether the outcome assessments were standardised, were assessed using a standard checklist developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group. This information was presented in a table describing the included studies, and provides a context for discussing the reliability of the results.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Having decided on studies to include, JF and MS independently extracted information from them using the proforma's designed by the review group. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. For each included trial, information was collected regarding the location of the study, methods of the study (as per the quality assessment checklist), the participants (age range, eligibility criteria), the nature of the interventions, and data relating to the outcomes specified above. Where possible, missing data was sought by the authors. Additional information was received from Miss Karen Bancroft (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehouse-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehouse 1990</LINK>), Dr Patrycja Fiegler (<LINK REF="STD-Kaminski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaminski 2001</LINK>), Dr Henk Franke (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>), Dr Christian Gnoth (<LINK REF="STD-Gnoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gnoth 1999</LINK>), Dr Milan Henzl (<LINK REF="STD-Henzl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henzl 1990</LINK>), Professor Kamran Moghissi (<LINK REF="STD-Moghissi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moghissi 1996</LINK>) , Dr Christian Roux (<LINK REF="STD-Roux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1995</LINK>), Dr Markus Seibel (<LINK REF="STD-Sillem-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sillem 1999</LINK>), Dr Eric Surrey (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 1992</LINK>) and Professor Olavi Ylikorkala (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1990</LINK>). Responses were received from Dr Joel Finkelstein (<LINK REF="STD-Finkelstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Finkelstein 1994</LINK>) and Dr John Rock (<LINK REF="STD-Rock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>ANALYSIS<BR/>Statistical analyses were performed according to the statistical guidelines for reviewers in the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group. All outcomes were continuous. Standard mean differences were used for comparisons because many different methods were used to measure bone mineral density. Although the different methods gave different absolute values, they conceptually measured the same parameter. Different methods of measuring bone density were thus considered together and not subjected to separate sub-group analysis. When there were multiple treatment arms in a study with a common control the control numbers were divided equally between the arms. If the control group contained an uneven number of participants (as was the case with <LINK REF="STD-Hornstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hornstein 1998</LINK>) so that numbers could not be equally divided then the analysis was done in both ways to detect possible differences in the results caused by an unequal division of the numerator and denominator. Heterogeneity in the data was noted and cautiously explored using previously identified characteristics of the studies, particularly assessments of quality. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine the viability of the results in relation to a number of factors including study quality and the source of the data (published or unpublished). See Review Group module details for more information.</P>
<P>TIMELINE<BR/>It is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for trials will be carried out every two years and the review updated accordingly.</P>

Tibolone, a synthetic steroid, is here grouped together with the oestrogen only/oestrogen + progesterone add-back as it exhibits oestrogenic, progestagenic and androgenic activity (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsay 1996</LINK>). No trials comparing depot GnRH analogues versus intranasal GnRH analogues were obtained. Neither were any trials comparing GnRH analogues versus the oral contraceptive pill or progestagens obtained. See table of included studies for further details.<BR/>
<BR/>OUTCOMES<BR/>All trials measured bone mineral density (BMD). Methods for measuring BMD were Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (16 trials), Dual energy photon absorptiometry (DPA) (three trials), Single energy photon absorptiometry (SPA) (three trials), Quantitative Computerised Tomography (QCT) (three trials). Five trials used more than one method of BMD measurements. Three trials failed to mention the method of bone mineral density measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vella-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vella 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiesel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kiesel 1996</LINK>). These authors have been contacted and we are awaiting responses. The sites for measuring bone mineral density used in the trials were lumbar spine and hip (femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanteric area and intertrochanteric area).

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> "Risk of bias of included studies" for a summary of the methodological risk of bias of included trials.</P>
<P>RANDOMISATION AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT<BR/>Ten studies had adequate randomisation. Four of these studies randomised by code (<LINK REF="STD-Eldred-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Eldred 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dawood 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindsay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercillini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vercillini 1996</LINK>), one randomised according to a computer-generated sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1996</LINK>), three randomised by a centralised scheme (<LINK REF="STD-Roux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gnoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gnoth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sillem-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sillem 1999</LINK>), one randomised with sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered, identical envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>) and one stated that cases were sequentially numbered (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehouse-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehouse 1990</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In twenty studies the adequacy of the method of randomisation was unclear. Sixteen of these studies stated that the trial was randomised but gave no further details, whereas one study randomised by sequential numerical allocation to a randomisation list before commencing the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gregoriou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gregoriou 1997</LINK>), one study randomised by permuted blocks of four at each of the 26 study sites (<LINK REF="STD-Hornstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hornstein 1998</LINK>), one study randomised by lottery (<LINK REF="STD-Mukherjee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mukherjee 1996</LINK>) and one study randomised to therapeutic groups based on order of entry, and not severity of disease (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 1992</LINK>). None of the studies used clearly inadequate methods of randomisation.</P>
<P>In twenty-five studies it was unclear whether the allocation concealment was adequate or not. Five studies had clearly adequate allocation concealment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>) used sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered, identical envelopes, another study used computerised allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 1992</LINK>), whilst the last three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Roux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gnoth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gnoth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sillem-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sillem 1999</LINK>) stated that they used a centralised randomisation process.</P>
<P>STUDY DESIGN<BR/>There were 15 single centre studies and 15 multi centre studies. All trials that did not state that they were multi centre were counted as single centre.</P>
<P>BLINDING<BR/>There were five open label studies, two single blinded studies (in both it was the assessor of bone mineral density that was blinded), 17 double-blind studies and one triple blind study. Five studies did not state any information on blinding. We have contacted the authors of these studies and are currently awaiting replies.</P>
<P>POWER CALCULATION<BR/>Twenty-six trials did not mention power calculations. Four trials had performed power calculations. <LINK REF="STD-Hornstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hornstein 1998</LINK> stated that "the initial sample size was chosen to ensure an 80 % power to detect a difference between any two dosing regimens with regard to mean percentage bone loss. Calculation was not performed to take into account dropout during follow-up." <LINK REF="STD-Moghissi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moghissi 1996</LINK> stated that the sample size had adequate power to detect a 2 % difference in the percentage change in bone mineral density. <LINK REF="STD-Mukherjee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mukherjee 1996</LINK> stated that the trial had an 80 % power to detect a 10 % change with an alfa level of 0.05. <LINK REF="STD-Vercillini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vercillini 1996</LINK> stated that "a post hoc analysis of our data indicated that, assuming an alpha level of 0.05, our study had a power of 89 % for the difference in bone mineral density variations at the end of treatment."</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:55:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>This review set out to determine the effect of treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) on the bone mineral density (BMD) of women with endometriosis, compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments used for endometriosis. We have only been able to complete part of these objectives because no studies were found comparing GnRHas with no treatment, OCP or progestagens. Unfortunately a large number of our included studies (15 out of a total of 30) did not provide enough data to be entered into the meta-analysis. We have contacted the authors of these studies and are currently awaiting responses. Meanwhile the main findings from these studies have been reported in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> "Descriptive data for trials not included in the meta-analysis."</P>
<P>
<B>GNRHA versus DANAZOL/GESTRINONE</B>
<BR/>Our findings broadly show that treatment with danazol or gestrinone has a protective effect on BMD when compared to treatment with GnRH analogues. After six months of treatment women treated with danazol had a significantly higher absolute value of BMD than GnRHa group women at the lumbar spine. Analysis of BMD percentage change from baseline at the lumbar spine after six months showed that whilst GnRHa groups had a reduction in BMD from baseline, the danazol groups actually had an increase in percentage BMD from baseline. This result was not unexpected, since danazol is known to have a directly suppressive effect on bone resorption presumably because of testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehouse-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehouse 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dawood 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgante-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morgante 1999</LINK>). At the femoral neck after six months treatment there was found to be no difference in percentage change from baseline between groups. However, this comparison included only one study. Follow-up results, after six months of treatment and six months follow-up, also showed danazol groups to have significantly higher absolute values of BMD and significantly smaller percentage changes from baseline at the lumbar spine when compared to GnRHa groups. At the femoral neck no difference was found between treatments but this comparison included only one study. In conclusion danazol has been shown to be protective of bone mineral density when compared to GnRH analogues. However, the significant androgenic side effects and adverse effects on lipid profile associated with danazol limit its usefulness as a first line treatment for endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Selak-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selak 2003</LINK>). Common side effects of danazol use are weight gain, acne, hirsutism, oily skin and hair, myalgia and headache (<LINK REF="STD-Henzl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henzl 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>GNRHA versus GNRHA + PROGESTERONE ONLY ADD-BACK<BR/>
</B>The addition of only progesterone to GnRHa therapy is not protective of BMD. All, but one result (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 1992</LINK>), showed no statistical difference between the two treatment groups, either on treatment or during follow-up off treatment. The reason for the one exception is not clear. The trial states the two treatment groups were similar in terms of mean age and prior therapeutic experience, but more patients with severe endometriosis were randomised to receive GnRHa only. There is evidence that women with endometriosis does not have any different bone mineral density than their healthy counterparts (<LINK REF="STD-Dodin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dodin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1991</LINK>), although we do not know whether BMD changes could be greater the more severe the endometriosis is. In conclusion, progesterone add-back does not have a protective effect on bone mineral density when prescribed with GnRH analogues.</P>
<P>
<B>GNRHA versus GNRHA + PROGESTERONE AND OESTROGEN/OESTROGEN ONLY ADD-BACK<BR/>
</B>This comparison had the highest number of trials that could not be entered into the meta-analysis because of insufficient data (six out of eleven trials in the comparison). The results from studies that did provide adequate data for the meta-analysis show that during treatment the use of progesterone + oestrogen add-back is protective of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine. They also show that twelve months after treatment bone mineral density remains higher in groups that received add-back. The results showed no difference between groups after twenty-four months of follow-up but the number of participants analysed was small (n = 13) and the comparison included only one study so we are unable to draw any firm conclusions based on this result. The results showed no difference in bone mineral density between groups at the femoral neck after treatment, but this comparison included only one study and therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions based on this result.</P>
<P>In conclusion we have found progesterone + oestrogen add-back to be protective of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine both during and after treatment and would therefore recommend the use of this add-back during treatment with GnRH analogues. Also hypoestrogenic side effects of hot flushes and loss of libido were significantly less in the group that received add-back (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonds-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonds 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Howell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moghissi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moghissi 1996</LINK>). This difference between the groups was not seen for vaginal dryness and headaches, though. However it must be noted that the studies included used differing add-back regimes and it is not possible with the evidence available to state which add-back regime is most effective.</P>
<P>
<B>GNRHA versus GNRHA + CALCIUM-REGULATING AGENTS (CRA'S)<BR/>
</B>This comparison was limited by the small number of studies that were found for inclusion (only three studies were found and only two provided enough data for the meta-analysis). All calcium-regulating agents (CRA's) were allocated to the same comparison. However, our results suggest that using different calcium regulating agents as add-back might have differing effects on BMD. <LINK REF="STD-Roux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roux 1995</LINK> used calcitonin as add-back and the results from this study showed no significant BMD difference between GnRHa only and add-back groups at either the femoral neck or lumbar spine after six months of treatment. However, the results from <LINK REF="STD-Somekawa-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Somekawa 1999</LINK> which used vitamin D and vitamin K add-back did show a significant difference between the percentage change of BMD from baseline in GnRHa only groups and all GnRHa + add-back groups. However, these results do not allow us to draw any solid conclusions about the type of CRA's that should be used in conjunction with GnRHas. They can only be used to suggest that this might be an area for further research.</P>
<P>
<B>GNRHA + LOW DOSE HRT versus GNRHA + HIGH DOSE HRT<BR/>
</B>Our findings show no differences in BMD between GnRHa + low dose HRT and GnRHa + high dose HRT both during treatment and during follow-up. However, this comparison is limited by the inclusion of only one study and we are therefore unable to conclude whether or not use of high-dose HRT is protective of bone mineral density. The adverse effects of HRT make the use of high dose HRT for this purpose unlikely.</P>
<P>
<B>METHOD OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY MEASUREMENT<BR/>
</B>The method of bone mineral density measurement is an important methodological consideration. In this review we have entered data from all methods of BMD measurement. However, there is some suggestion that certain methods of measurement are more accurate than others. It is generally agreed that Single Photon Absorptiometry and Dual Photon Absorptiometry are less accurate methods than Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) and the newer method of Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehouse-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehouse 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eldred-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Eldred 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uemura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uemura 1993</LINK>). Whilst DEXA and QCT are of about equal clinical value (<LINK REF="REF-Wahner-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahner 1989</LINK>), DEXA allows measurement of the femoral head, has a lower radiation dose and is a more precise method, particularly for measurements of the anterior/posterior spine. Because QCT provides a measure of volumetric density, measurements may give an overestimate of actual changes (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2002</LINK>). In half of the studies included in the meta-analysis measurements were done by DEXA, whilst QCT was used in three, DPA used in two, and two studies used more than one method (QCT and DPA or DEXA and DPA). The method of measurement does not seem to have influenced the results, although it is evident that QCT measurements gave higher percentage changes of BMD. QCT was used in four studies, all in the GnRHa versus danazol/gestrinone group. In a sensitivity analysis removing the studies using QCT, the overall result was not changed; there was still evidence of a significant difference in BMD between GnRHa and danazol/gestrinone groups.</P>
<P>
<B>LENGTH OF TREATMENT<BR/>
</B>As stated in the "changes to the original protocol" section, we only included studies where treatment was given for a minimum of six months. This was because medical treatment less than six months is less likely to cure the women of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Audebert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audebert 1998</LINK>). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1996</LINK>) was excluded due to this change. It is a strength to the review that most of the included studies gave treatment for six months, as this makes the trials easily comparable.</P>
<P>
<B>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP</B>
<BR/>Sixteen of the studies did not do any follow-up measurements, ten studies followed up their women for half a year and three studies did one-year follow-up measurements. The longest follow-up was two years, but only one study had this length of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Hornstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hornstein 1998</LINK>). In the GnRHa versus danazol/gestrinone comparison there was a significant difference during treatment and in the six months follow-up, except from at the femoral neck after six months of treatment and six months of follow-up. What about the longer-term follow-up? If one perhaps could prove that there was no significant difference in bone mineral density on a longer term, women would be spared the androgenic side effects and adverse effects on lipid profile from danazol treatment. In the GnRHa versus GnRHa and progesterone only group the two-year follow-up results are consistent with the results during treatment, as is also the case when comparing low dose HRT to high dose HRT. Comparing GnRHa to GnRHa plus oestrogen and progesterone/oestrogen only add-back, the result changed from significant difference during treatment and at the one year follow-up to non-significant at the two-year follow-up measurement. The fact that not all comparison groups had follow-up measurements, and the ones that did only had a few trials doing follow-up measurements, weakens our results.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Primarily clinicians and women with endometriosis will make decisions about the choice of drug based on their ability to control the symptoms of a disease. In endometriosis the main symptom is pain and women tend to make treatment decisions based on a treatments effectiveness for this condition. A previous review has shown no difference in efficacy between medical treatments for pain associated with endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2003</LINK>). However if a treatment causes a reduction in bone mineral density then this is a very important side effect since a reduction of one standard deviation (SD) in bone mass is associated with an increase of fifty to one hundred percent in the incidence of fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Dawood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dawood 1995</LINK>). Therefore it should be an important consideration when making treatment decisions.</P>
<P>This review has shown that both danazol/gestrinone and progesterone + oestrogen add-back are protective against the reduction of bone mineral density caused by GnRH analogues. However, as danazol is associated with a number of adverse side effects we would recommend the use of progesterone + oestrogen add-back in the treatment of endometriosis. However, two years after treatment is stopped, no difference was seen between the group receiving GnRHa only and the group receiving GnRHa + HRT add-back.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research should consider the dose regimens of oestrogen and progesterone add-back therapy, the length of treatment and duration of response. Alternatives to hormone replacement therapy should also be investigated further; particularly calcium-regulating agents.</P>

<BR/>Prior to data extraction the reviewers agreed to leave out studies measuring bone mineral density at the forearm/radius and calcaneus. The reason for this decision is that turnover of cortical bone is approximately one eighth of trabecular bone and therefore the effects of GnRH agonists are more profound in trabecular than cortical bone in time periods studied (<LINK REF="STD-Dawood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dawood 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1990</LINK>). At this point we also decided to include only trials where the treatment period exceeded six months. The reason for this decision is that shorter treatment periods do not seem to treat the disease effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Audebert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audebert 1998</LINK>).</P>
