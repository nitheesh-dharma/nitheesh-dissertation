<TITLE>Surgical treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There is no strong evidence for the replacement of standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) by alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The decision to apply special, minimally invasive operations instead of standard OCTR seems to be guided by the surgeon's and patient's preferences.</P>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder causing pins and needles and pain in the hand due to compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist. Its severity can range from mild to severe. Severe cases are generally treated surgically. This review aimed to compare different surgical options for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Current evidence from randomised controlled trials showed that none of the alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release seem to offer better relief from symptoms in the short- or long-term, although a special type of operation (endoscopic carpal tunnel release) seems to enable people to return to their work or daily activities sooner (on average approximately a week). </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy of the various surgical techniques in relieving symptoms and promoting return to work or activities of daily living and to compare the occurrence of side-effects and complications in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated the searches in 2006. We conducted computer-aided searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched in June 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2006) and also tracked references in bibliographies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing various surgical techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors performed study selection, assessment of methodological quality and data extraction independently of each other.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-three studies were included in the review of which 10 were newly identified in this update. The methodological quality of the trials ranged from fair to good; however, the use of allocation concealment was mentioned explicitly in only seven trials. Many studies failed to present the results in sufficient detail to enable statistical pooling. Pooling was also impeded by the vast variety of outcome measures that were applied in the various studies. None of the existing alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release offered significantly better relief from symptoms in the short- or long-term. In three studies with a total of 294 participants, endoscopic carpal tunnel release resulted in earlier return to work or activities of daily living than open carpal tunnel release, with a weighted mean difference of -6 days (95% CI -9 to -3 days).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no strong evidence supporting the need for replacement of standard open carpal tunnel release by existing alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The decision to apply endoscopic carpal tunnel release instead of open carpal tunnel release seems to be guided by the surgeon's and patient's preferences.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-27 21:47:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common compression neuropathy of the upper extremity. The annual incidence of CTS in primary care in the UK and the Netherlands is estimated at approximately 90 per 100,000 new presentations in men and 193 to 280 per 100,000 new presentations in women (<LINK REF="REF-Bongers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bongers 2007</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Latinovic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latinovic 2006</LINK>). In an Italian population the prevalence of CTS was estimated at 1.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Salaffi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salaffi 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>CTS is caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist and produces pain, paraesthesiae and hypoaesthesia in the hand. The severity of CTS ranges from mild to severe. Mild CTS presents as intermittent symptoms of paresthesiae and numbness, often at night. Severe CTS may cause permanent atrophy of the thenar muscles innervated by the median nerve and permanent loss of sensation in the median nerve distribution in the hand. CTS is a clinical diagnosis. Electrophysiological tests (nerve conduction studies) are often performed to support the clinical diagnosis.</P>
<P>For the treatment of CTS, both conservative and surgical options are available. Surgical treatment is generally preferred in severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome whilst non-surgical treatment is usually initiated for mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1987</LINK>). Surgical treatment is also indicated in cases where conservative management fails. Conservative treatment includes no intervention, wrist splints, corticosteroid injections and other non-invasive options (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>). Surgery consists of dividing the transverse carpal ligament thereby increasing the canal volume (<LINK REF="REF-Ablove-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ablove 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richman 1989</LINK>) and reducing the pressure on the nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Okutsu-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okutsu 1989</LINK>). In 2000, operative treatment was undertaken in 31% of the new presentations of CTS in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Latinovic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latinovic 2006</LINK>). In an earlier study in Denmark the estimated incidence of CTS operations was 0.61 per 1,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Ebskov-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebskov 1997</LINK>). In the United States approximately 40% of all CTS cases are treated surgically (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>). Various surgical techniques are available and there has been considerable discussion about which method is the most effective.</P>
<P>Until recently, open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) with a long curvilinear palmar incision was the standard procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Taleisnik-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taleisnik 1973</LINK>). Later the incision was confined to the palm of the hand. A two to three cm long incision is now recommended for a standard OCTR without special designed instruments (<LINK REF="REF-MacKinnon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKinnon 2005</LINK>). In addition to cutting the transverse carpal ligament, the overlying structures from the skin to the median nerve are also divided. Sometimes an epineurotomy is performed because the nerve sheath (epineurium) is thickened (<LINK REF="REF-Fissette-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fissette 1979</LINK>). If there is scar tissue within the nerve an internal neurolysis may be performed to separate the involved fascicles from this fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1973</LINK>). Endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) is a relatively new procedure. Its proposed advantage is that by dividing the transverse carpal ligament from within the carpal tunnel the overlying structures are left intact. This might decrease post-operative morbidity and hasten return to work. Two techniques are commonly used for ECTR: the single-portal technique as described by Agee (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agee-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agee 1994</LINK>) and the two-portal technique described by Chow (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1993</LINK>). Since the introduction of ECTR various types of new incisions for OCTR have been introduced which further try to reduce surgical trauma and hence recovery time (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>We previously published a systematic review comparing different operations for CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2001</LINK>) and have revised the review for publication in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>We set out to systematically review the evidence from randomised controlled trials which compared the short-term and long-term efficacies of the various surgical treatments for relieving CTS symptoms and promoting return to work or resumption of activities of daily living (ADL). We also analysed the occurrence of side-effects and complications.</P>

<P>The searches were updated in 2006. To identify publications we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched in June 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2006) and tracked references in bibliographies. We replaced the original generic Cochrane search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>) by a new, highly sensitive search (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>). This search was combined with the following specific search for CTS: 'carpal tunnel syndrome [mesh]' OR 'carpal tunnel syndrome [tw]' OR 'carpal tunnel [tw]' OR 'carp* syndr* [tw]' OR 'carp* tunn* [tw]' OR 'tunn* syndr* [tw]' OR 'median nerve entrapment [mesh]' OR 'median nerve entrapment [tw]'. Finally, the resulting set was combined with the following specific search for surgical interventions: 'surgical [mesh]' OR 'surgical [tw]' OR 'surgery [mesh]' OR 'surgery [tw]' OR 'release [tw]' OR 'reconstruct* [tw]' OR 'epineurotomy [tw]'. To be included, a study had to meet the following criteria: (1) the study population consisted of patients with CTS; (2) different surgical techniques were compared; (3) the study was designed as an RCT; (4) the results were published as a full report. Two review authors independently selected studies and any disagreements were discussed to reach consensus.</P>

<P>Two review authors performed study selection, assessment of methodological quality and data abstraction independently of each other. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We undertook assessment of methodological quality by following the list of internal validity criteria recommended for systematic reviews in the field of musculoskeletal disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tulder 1997</LINK>). The list was adapted for CTS with regard to prognostic indicators and outcome measures (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In addition, because the intervention was surgery, the criteria 'care-provider blinded' and 'compliance acceptable' were omitted from the original list. The criterion 'patient blinded' was only applied in studies comparing OCTR and OCTR with an additional procedure because with those techniques similar incisions were made. Criteria could be scored as positive ('yes'), negative ('no') or unclear ('don't know'). The criteria are shown in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Studies with a negative score for 'adequate randomisation' were excluded from further analyses. Data from the articles were recorded on a standardised form. Information was collected on participants (age, gender, duration of symptoms, electrophysiological confirmation, number of patients treated bilaterally, number of patients or hands randomised), interventions (surgical technique), outcome measures, timing of the follow-up measurements, and results (point estimates and measures of variability, number of patients or hands).<BR/>

<P>Results of studies that were both adequately randomised and clinically homogeneous (for which the participants, interventions, outcome measures and timing of the follow-up measurements were considered to be sufficiently similar), were combined, initially using a fixed-effect model. A random-effects model was used if the studies were statistically heterogeneous. Studies that were clinically heterogeneous or did not present the data in sufficient detail to enable statistical pooling were summarised qualitatively. For dichotomous outcomes the relative risk was used as the measure of treatment effect and for continuous outcomes the mean difference was used. In all cases 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We attempted to perform all analyses according to the intention-to-treat principle.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We updated the search in 2006 and, since the last update of 2003, we identified 13 new studies. A total number of 41 publications regarding various surgical treatment options for CTS met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 35 were found in MEDLINE, five publications were identified in EMBASE and one in CENTRAL. Two studies were published twice (in German and in English), so the results of both sets of papers were combined (<LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sennwald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sennwald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>). Similarly, data from two publications of the same trial, one reporting short-term and the other long-term data (<LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1987</LINK>), were combined for the purposes of this review. We excluded three studies because the participants were not adequately randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Borisch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borisch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foulkes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Foulkes 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sch_x00e4_fer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schäfer 1996</LINK>), one cost-analysis study (<LINK REF="STD-Leger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leger 2000</LINK>) and one study because it addressed the application of corticosteroid irrigation during surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Padua-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Padua 2003</LINK>). In the study by Agee and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>), inadequate randomisation applied to the 25 patients with bilateral involvement, but not to the remaining 97 patients with unilateral involvement. Data regarding return to work were presented separately for those 97 patients and were included in our review. Thus, we included 33 studies in the review (among which 10 were new studies). Details of the participants, interventions and outcomes in these studies are presented in the Table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>

Different types of ECTR were applied. All techniques were aimed at dividing the transverse carpal ligament from within the carpal tunnel but differed in the way in which this was achieved. Ten studies addressed Agee's one-portal technique (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sennwald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sennwald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foucher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foucher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoefnagels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoefnagels 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westphal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Westphal 2000</LINK>) whereas in nine studies Chow's two-portal technique was used (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dumontier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dumontier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDermid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDermid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). </P>

In two studies it was not clear how CTS was diagnosed (<LINK REF="STD-Dumontier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dumontier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westphal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Westphal 2000</LINK>). One study also addressed patients with secondary CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>). In four studies the type of CTS was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foucher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foucher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoefnagels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoefnagels 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDermid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDermid 2003</LINK>). In four studies only patients with bilateral CTS were included (<LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). In two of those studies the first hand was randomised to either ECTR or OCTR and, after full recovery of the first hand (<LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>) or after at least six months (<LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>), the other hand was treated with the alternative treatment. In both studies the timing of the procedures was discarded and in one the analysis pertained to all hands, violating the assumption of independent observation (<LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>). In the other two studies ECTR was randomly allocated to one of both hands and the other hand was treated with the alternative procedure in the same session (<LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). Three of the four studies with a matched design applied an appropriate statistical analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Finally, in the study by Agee and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>), randomisation of patients with bilateral CTS was discarded because patients who were randomised to ECTR refused to undergo OCTR as a second procedure. Therefore, the 25 patients with bilateral CTS have been omitted from further analysis.</P>
<P>Six studies compared standard incision with a modified incision applied to OCTR (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Citron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Citron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nitzsche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nitzsche 1999</LINK>). Although these studies used different types of modified incisions they were considered to be more or less similar because the purpose of all these new types of incisions was to provide an alternative to ECTR. These techniques aimed to reduce post-operative morbidity (like in ECTR), but also allowed release of the transverse carpal ligament (partly) under direct vision (as in OCTR). One study addressed both patients with idiopathic and secondary CTS without requiring electrophysiological confirmation (<LINK REF="STD-Citron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Citron 1997</LINK>) while three studies addressed only patients with electrophysiologically-confirmed, idiopathic CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>). One study addressed patients with electrophysiologically-confirmed CTS and excluded patients with traumatic CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>) and one study did not mention the type of CTS patient (<LINK REF="STD-Nitzsche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nitzsche 1999</LINK>). In this study additional epineurotomy was applied in both intervention groups.</P>
<P>One study compared standard OCTR with OCTR with lengthening of the flexor retinaculum (<LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>). This study involved 26 patients with either idiopathic or secondary, bilateral, electrophysiologically-confirmed CTS. Lengthening was randomly allocated to one of both hands and the other hand was treated with standard OCTR in the same session. An appropriate matched statistical analysis was applied. </P>
<P>Three studies compared OCTR through a mini incision assisted by the Knifelight instrument with either standard OCTR (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>) or OCTR with a limited incision (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>). One study included only electrophysiologically-confirmed cases of CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>) and in one study the type of CTS (idiopathic or secondary, clinical or electrophysiologically-confirmed) was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>). The final study addressed 32 patients with bilateral, clinical CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>). The hand with the most severe symptoms was randomly allocated to one of the procedures and the other hand was treated with the alternative procedure after six weeks. It was not clear whether an appropriate, matched analysis was performed in this study.</P>
<P>Three studies compared standard OCTR with additional internal neurolysis (<LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>). One study pertaining to idiopathic cases of CTS did not require electrophysiological confirmation of CTS for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>); one study addressed only severe cases of CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>); and one study did not mention the type of CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study pertaining to patients with both idiopathic and secondary electrophysiologically-confirmed CTS, compared standard OCTR with additional epineurotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Leinberry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leinberry 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final study addressed patients with idiopathic, electrophysiologically-confirmed CTS and compared standard OCTR with additional tenosynovectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Shum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2002</LINK>). </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>With the first release of this review, the two review authors initially agreed on 90% of the assessments of methodological quality. Disagreement was due to reading errors (65%) and interpretation differences (35%). With the 2003 update (seven additional studies), the two review authors initially agreed on 79 of 91 items (87%). With the 2006 update (10 additional studies), the two review authors initially agreed on 93 of 130 items (72 %). All disagreements were resolved by discussion. Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> presents the scores on the internal validity items of the criteria list. The studies met between zero and all of the eight or nine internal validity criteria. Seventeen of the 33 studies fulfilled at least five of the validity criteria. Many studies reported on randomised treatment allocation but failed to describe either the exact procedure (b1) or whether concealed allocation had been performed (b2). The application of allocation concealment was mentioned explicitly in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sennwald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sennwald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>).

<P>With a few exceptions, study results could not be combined because the studies were heterogeneous with regard to outcome measures (different types of symptoms assessed or different scales used; different definitions of time to return to work or activities of daily living (ADL); different complications; different timing of the follow-up measurements). In addition, many studies suffered from poor data presentation or failed to present effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We present quantitative results only when reported appropriately by the original authors.</P>

<P>Eight studies addressed long-term results on symptoms and no significant differences between the groups were found (<LINK REF="STD-Dumontier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dumontier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDermid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDermid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>) except in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>) in which there was a significant difference in mean pain scores (scale 0 to 100) after 12 months in favour of ECTR (mean difference (MD) -5.8, 95% CI -13.3 to -1.7).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis was possible with three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoefnagels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoefnagels 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>) that presented the symptom severity score and the functional status score of Levine (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1993</LINK>) after three months. ECTR resulted in a lower symptom severity score (MD -0.2; 95% CI -0.5 to 0.2) (<I>see</I> Comparison 01, Outcome 02) and a lower functional status score (MD -0.2; 95% CI -0.6 to 0.2) (<I>see</I> Comparison 01, Outcome 03). These differences were very small and in both meta-analyses there was large heterogeneity with an I<SUP>2 </SUP>of approximately 90%, possibly due to the influence of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>). Two studies addressed the respective scores after one year (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>), resulting in MDs approaching zero (see Comparison 01, Outcome 04 and Outcome 05).</P>
<P>Fourteen studies reported results (expressed in many different formats) regarding return to work or ADL. Eight of those (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sennwald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sennwald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>) concluded that patients returned to work or ADL earlier after ECTR (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), whereas one study found the opposite (<LINK REF="STD-Dumontier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dumontier 1995</LINK>). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Foucher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foucher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoefnagels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoefnagels 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDermid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDermid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westphal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Westphal 2000</LINK>) found no significant difference. Overall, the mean difference in return to work ranged from zero to 25 days in favour of ECTR. Meta-analysis was possible for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>). The weighted mean difference in time to return to work was -6 days (95% CI -9 to -3) in favour of ECTR (see Comparison 01, Outcome 06).</P>
<P>All studies comparing ECTR with OCTR reported complications in both groups, but no major complications resulting in permanent damage or major impairments were described (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). It seems that ECTR gives more transient nerve problems (for example neurapraxia, numbness, paraesthesiae) and OCTR more wound problems (for example infection, hypertrophic scarring, scar tenderness). In a few cases, ECTR had to be abandoned and OCTR was performed instead. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>) two cases of sympathetic reflex dystrophy were recorded out of 25 hands in the OCTR group. The need for repeated surgery was assessed in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atroshi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Atroshi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDermid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDermid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>); the relative risk was 1.2 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.1) in favour of OCTR. Repeated surgery was needed in 12 out of 513 ECTR procedures versus in 5 out of 370 OCTR procedures (see Comparison 01, Outcome 07).</P>

Pillar pain is pain at the so-called "pillars", the origins of the thenar and hypothenar muscle on either side of the surgical incision. In one study repeated surgery was necessary in two of 128 ECTR patients (1.5%) and in six of 65 patients treated with modified OCTR (9%; relative risk (RR) 0.2, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.8) (<LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Six studies compared OCTR using a modified incision versus OCTR with a standard incision (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Citron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Citron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nitzsche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nitzsche 1999</LINK>). Trivial to minor differences between the groups were found with regard to relief of symptoms (expressed in many different non-combinable formats) in the 1.5 to 3 months after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>) and 0.5 to 2 years after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Citron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Citron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies examined the time to return to work. One study found a significant earlier return to work in favour of the short incision group (<LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>) whereas the other study did not find a significant difference in effect between the two types of incisions (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>No major complications (resulting in permanent damage or major impairments) were reported (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). The standard incision resulted in slightly more scar pain or tenderness compared to the modified incision in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Citron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Citron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jugovac-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jugovac 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamichi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamichi 1997</LINK>), but this was not confirmed in a fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_ser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brüser 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 1996</LINK>). In one study two instances of wound infection were reported in the standard OCTR group; repeated surgery was necessary in six of 65 patients treated with modified OCTR (9%) and in three of 60 patients with standard OCTR (5%; RR 1.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 7.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Eichhorn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eichhorn 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open carpal tunnel release: with or without lengthening of the flexor retinaculum</HEADING>
<P>One excellent study that fulfilled all methodological criteria was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>). After 12 weeks and (on average) 26 weeks, no significant differences in symptom severity score and functional status score were found (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Return to work was not assessed because only patients with bilateral involvement were included. No complications were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open carpal tunnel release: mini open technique assisted by the Knifelight instrument versus standard OCTR or OCTR with mini incision</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared OCTR through a mini incision assisted by the Knifelight instrument with either standard OCTR (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>) or with OCTR using limited open incision (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>). In two studies the follow-up measurement after six weeks revealed no significant difference in the proportion of effectively treated patients between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>) (see Comparison 04, Outcome 01). One study found a significant difference in the symptom severity score and the functional status score of Levine after a mean follow-up period of 19 (range 12 to 28) months, in favour of the Knifelight instrument; but at a mean follow-up of 30 (range 24 to 42) months no significant differences were observed (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two studies patients treated with the Knifelight instrument returned to work significantly earlier (eight to nine days) than the standard OCTR group (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>), but in one study no difference was observed (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study the following complications were reported: sympathetic reflex dystrophy (1), superficial wound infection (1), procedure replaced by standard OCTR (2) in the Knifelight group (39 patients); and pillar pain (4) and partial wound dehiscence (1) in the standard OCTR group (43 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Helm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Helm 2003</LINK>). We suspect that the two patients in whom the procedure could not be performed with the Knifelight instrument, were analysed in the standard OCTR group. Significantly, less scar tenderness was observed in the Knifelight group in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>). In one study recurrent disease occurred more often in the Knifelight group (5%) compared to the limited open incision OCTR group (&lt; 1%) (<LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open carpal tunnel release: with or without internal neurolysis</HEADING>
<P>In the three studies that evaluated OCTR with or without internal neurolysis, no or trivial differences between the procedures were found with respect to improving CTS symptoms after three to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1985</LINK>) and after three months (<LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).

No study addressed return to work or ADL. One study reported a similar number of complications in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>); one study merely stated that there were no complications ascribable to internal neurolysis (<LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmgren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Holmgren 1987</LINK>) and the other study provided no information on complications (<LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>As we revised this previously published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2001</LINK>) for publication in The Cochrane Library, not all the usual policies of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Review Group were followed. We did not try to collect unpublished data or contact the original authors for information. For the updates, however, we did not apply a language restriction (unlike in the first version of our review).</P>
<P>The major limitation of this review was the limited availability of well-presented, sufficiently homogeneous results. Not withstanding the fact that many patients were treated in an RCT that addressed the effect of some form of CTS treatment, formal meta-analysis could only be performed for a few studies and outcomes. We cannot exclude that these meta-analyses will be biased, due to possible selective presentation of the outcomes. This impeded the formulation of sound conclusions regarding the optimal treatment option for CTS. Therefore, we present the results of this systematic review in a predominantly qualitative way. For future research, we strongly agree with the recommendations made by others for developing consensus on a core set of outcomes to be addressed in RCTs regarding CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jerosch-Herold 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review included 33 randomised controlled trials comparing standard OCTR with various alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of CTS. Ten of the 33 trials included in this update were new trials.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by the use of a list of criteria consisting of nine items pertaining to internal validity. Included in the list were criteria for concealment of allocation and double blinding which are regarded as being most important in reducing bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). With few exceptions, the methodological quality of the RCTs was fair to good and 17 of the 33 studies fulfilled at least five of the criteria for internal validity. The application of allocation concealment, however, was mentioned explicitly in only seven trials. </P>
<P>When dealing with patients with bilateral involvement the statistical analysis is quite a challenge. Two problems may arise when considering hands instead of patients: violation of statistical assumptions and unit of analysis errors. Common statistical methods assume independency of observations. The observations in both hands of patients with bilateral CTS, however, are not independent. When the assumption of independency is violated the standard error of the effect estimate will be underestimated, resulting in a greater chance of a type I error and too narrow confidence intervals. Among the statistical methods that can address such dependent observations, are methods for repeated measurements (included matched analyses) and generalised estimating equations. These specialised statistical methods must be applied for outcomes where it makes sense for each hand to be assessed separately, such as for improvement of CTS-specific symptoms, complications and side-effects. Unit of analysis errors can be made when addressing outcomes such as overall improvement and time to return to work. For these outcomes it does not make sense to refer the result to one hand or the other. In that instance 'patients' should be the units of analysis. When 'hands' are chosen, as (wrong) units of analysis, the sample size will be inflated artificially which results in an erroneously small standard error of the effect estimate and thus too narrow a confidence interval.<BR/> <BR/>In our systematic review, hands were the units of analysis (instead of patients) in 13 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foucher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foucher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leinberry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leinberry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>). In three of these studies the number of patients with bilateral CTS was small (<LINK REF="STD-Foucher-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foucher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackinnon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mackinnon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2002</LINK>) so no major effect was to be expected as a result of applying the wrong unit of analysis. In ten studies, however, the percentage of patients with bilateral CTS ranged from 10 to 48% (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cellocco-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cellocco 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leinberry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leinberry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lowry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trumble-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trumble 2002</LINK>), which may have led to the above-mentioned problems with the analysis. </P>
<P>In six studies a matched design was applied among patients with bilateral CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). Four studies applied a statistical analysis that accounted for the dependency between both hands of the same patient (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>) but in two studies the type of analysis was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>). In three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferdinand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferdinand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>) ECTR was randomly allocated to one of both hands and the other hand was treated with OCTR in the same session. In the other three studies a time lag was present between the two operations, ranging from six weeks to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>), which seems to have been ignored in the analysis.</P>
<P>In the 16 studies with considerable bilateral involvement it was very difficult (if not impossible) to assess an unbiased effect regarding outcomes such as return to work. For example, in the study of Brown and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1993</LINK>) patients returned to work earlier after ECTR. It was not clear how previous surgery in the contralateral hand affected the return to work when surgery was done in the remaining hand. An additional problem arose in three patients where both hands underwent simultaneous release of the carpal tunnel. It was not entirely clear from the report if these hands were included in the analysis (and how). A similar problem occurred in the study of Erdmann (<LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>). Information was presented on the days for return to work in a group of 46 patients. However, 55 hands were operated on in this group and it was not clear from the report if the days for return to work were given for patients or for hands. Agee and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>) tackled the unit-of-analysis problem by presenting the results regarding return to work only for patients who had been treated unilaterally. The results of the studies could be re-analysed by the use of statistical methods that address the dependency of the data. Because the required data for such analyses were generally not presented in the original publications, cooperation of the original authors in providing the necessary information would be needed.</P>
<P>Despite the identification of 10 new studies, none of the existing alternatives to standard OCTR (ECTR; OCTR with a modified type of incision; lengthening of the flexor retinaculum; additional internal neurolysis, epineurotomy or tenosynovectomy; or carpal tunnel release assisted by an operating device) seemed to offer better relief from CTS symptoms in either the short term or the long term. Possible advantages of ECTR would be earlier return to work or ADL and fewer wound problems, whereas possible disadvantages may be higher complication rates and costs. In this update a meta-analysis of the average number of days to return to work was six days lower in favour of ECTR. </P>
<P>Until now, overall complication rates seemed to be small and similar for ECTR and OCTR (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckstyns-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckstyns 1999</LINK>). This finding was confirmed in a recent review that found major complications (defined as structural damage to nerves, arteries or tendons) in only 42 of 22,327 (0.19%) endoscopic carpal tunnel releases and in 28 of 5,669 (0.49%) open releases (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2006</LINK>). In our review we found a (non-significant) excess in the need for repeat surgery after ECTR. It should be noted that although the complication rates after ECTR may be similar or less, many problematic cases of CTS are generally excluded from ECTR, for example patients needing an adjuvant procedure (such as synovectomy in the case of inflammatory arthritis), and patients with space-occupying lesions or with stiff (arthritic) wrists (<LINK REF="REF-Einhorn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Einhorn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>In 1999, a cost-effectiveness study concluded that the two techniques had similar total costs but that ECTR was more costly if the difference between the techniques in mean time to return to work was less than 21 days (<LINK REF="REF-Vasen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasen 1999</LINK>). Among the studies comparing ECTR with other procedures two reported a difference of more than 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Agee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1994</LINK>), whereas our meta-analysis resulted in an average of six days.</P>
<P>In one of the studies included in this review ECTR turned out to be more cost-effective in employed patients but not in the non-employed (<LINK REF="STD-Saw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Saw 2003</LINK>). Finally, in a randomised controlled trial of 194 CTS patients comparing minimally invasive carpal tunnel release with OCTR treatment costs were estimated from resource use and hospital financial data (<LINK REF="REF-Lorgelly-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorgelly 2005</LINK>). Minimally invasive carpal tunnel decompression turned out to be more effective but more costly. The authors concluded that the additional expense for such a small improvement in function and no improvement in symptoms would not be regarded as value-for-money.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no strong evidence supporting the need for replacement of standard OCTR by existing alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of CTS. The decision to apply ECTR instead of OCTR seems to be merely guided by the surgeon's and patient's preferences.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With respect to ECTR compared to OCTR, the collection of missing data from the original authors should be pursued in order to enable meta-analysis of results. If possible, an individual patient data meta-analysis should be undertaken. <BR/>There is no need for new RCTs comparing OCTR plus existing additional procedures or existing alternative incisions with OCTR alone for the treatment of CTS. <BR/>Future research into interventions for CTS should use standardised outcome measures to enable results from various studies to be combined. In addition, a correct unit of analysis should be chosen (patients instead of hands) or adequate statistical methods should be applied which are able to deal with the dependency between the two hands of the same patient.</P>
