<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>
<I>Pneumocystis jiroveci</I> is a fungus causing pneumonia mainly among patients with an impaired immune system, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer patients, following organ transplantation, and patients receiving immune suppressive medications. Previous evidence shows that preventive antibiotic treatment (before the onset of the disease) could reduce mortality and morbidity from PCP among patients with HIV. We assessed whether this is also true for immunocompromised non-HIV patients.</P>
<P>The patients included in the 13 trials we identified were adults with acute leukemia or solid organ transplantation and children with acute leukemia. This review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic effective against PCP, significantly reduced the occurrence of PCP by 85%. We found no evidence for a reduction in all cause mortality. Confidence in the results for PCP was moderate to high, while for mortality it was low due to paucity of data. Preventive treatment was not associated with an increased rate of adverse events. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be administered thrice weekly as effectively as once daily.</P>
<P>Based on our results, the number of people that need to be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for a prolonged period of time (ranging between several weeks to three years in the included trials) in order to prevent one episode of PCP infection was 19; when PCP infection occurs at a rate of about 6% without prophylaxis. Given the low rate of adverse events, prophylaxis should be considered for patients at similar risk of PCP.<BR/>

<P>Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to March 2014), LILACS (to March 2014), relevant conference proceedings; and references of identified trials.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing prophylaxis with an antibiotic effective against PCP versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotic(s) with no activity against PCP; and trials comparing different antibiotics effective against PCP among immunocompromised non-HIV patients.

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each trial and extracted data from the included trials. We contacted authors of the included trials to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was documented PCP infections. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Thirteen trials performed between the years 1974 and 2008 were included, involving 1412 patients. Four trials included 520 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the remaining trials included adults with acute leukemia, solid organ transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Compared to no treatment or treatment with fluoroquinolones (inactive against Pneumocystis), there was an 85% reduction in the occurrence of PCP in patients receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 10 trials, 1000 patients). The evidence was graded as moderate due to possible risk of bias. PCP-related mortality was also significantly reduced, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; nine trials, 886 patients) (low quality of evidence due to possible risk of bias and imprecision), but in trials comparing PCP prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality (low quality of evidence due to imprecision). Occurrence of leukopenia or neutropenia and their duration were not reported consistently. No significant differences in overall adverse events or events requiring discontinuation were seen comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to no treatment or placebo (four trials, 470 patients, moderate quality evidence). No differences between once daily versus thrice weekly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were seen (two trials, 207 patients).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Given an event rate of 6.2% in the control groups of the included trials, prophylaxis for PCP using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is highly effective among non-HIV immunocompromised patients, with a number needed to treat to prevent PCP of 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a similar baseline risk of PCP.<BR/>

<P>
<I>Pneumocystis jirovecii </I>is a ubiquitous, species-specific fungus. Infection with <I>Pneumocystis jirovecii</I> is common and occurs at an early age. Serologic surveys have shown nearly universal seropositivity to Pneumocystis by two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Vargas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vargas 2001</LINK>). Primary infection is probably largely asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2010</LINK>). Colonization with PCP is common, documented to occur in more than 50% of the general adult population, and is assumed to represent re-infections through person-to-person transmission or environmental re-exposures rather than re-activation (<LINK REF="REF-Gigliotti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gigliotti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ponce-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponce 2010</LINK>). Symptomatic, tissue invasive disease is rare and limited to immunocompromised individuals, mainly patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) before immune reconstitution. The most common manifestation is Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Common symptoms of PCP include progressive shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fever. Physical examination often reveals tachypnea, tachycardia, and normal or near-normal findings on lung ausculation. Hypoxemia is found in most patients. In HIV patients the clinical presentation is usually subtle, despite high organism load, and the mortality rate is 10% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2012</LINK>). In contrast, among non-HIV patients PCP typically presents with an abrupt onset of respiratory failure. The mortality rate among non-HIV patients is 30% to 60%, with a greater risk of death amongst cancer patients in part related to delays in diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2012</LINK>). In a retrospective study of Pneumocystis infections at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and mortality rates were 10%, 7% and 10% among HIV patients versus 69%, 66% and 39% among non-HIV patients (<LINK REF="REF-Mansharamani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansharamani 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of PCP among HIV patients in developed countries has decreased with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis, although it remains the most prevalent opportunistic infection in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2012</LINK>). Conversely, the incidence of PCP in immunocompromised patients without HIV is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2012</LINK>). Patients at risk include cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients, and other patients treated with corticosteroids or other immune suppressive medications.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>
<I>Pneumocystis jirovecii, </I>despite its classification as a fungus, is susceptible to several antibacterial and antiparasitic drugs that can be used for prevention of infection among patients at high risk for PCP. The agent most commonly used for prophylaxis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Other agents that have activity against <I>Pneumocystis jirovecii</I> include dapsone, pentamidine, atovaquone, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and clindamycin and primaquine in combination. All these drugs can cause side effects that may counterbalance the benefits of PCP prevention. TMP/SMX can cause mild to severe skin rash (up to the life threatening reactions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Leukopenia (a decrease in the white blood cell count) induced by TMP/SMX may adversely affect patients with hematological cancer. Liver and renal dysfunction may be detrimental to solid organ transplant recipients. The common side effects of dapsone are hemolysis and methemoglobinemia. Hypersensitivity can be life-threatening, as for TMP/SMX. Pentamidine must be administered through the aerosolized route and can cause acute reactions during inhalation both for the patient being treated and for bystanders (which include respiratory and cardiac manifestations).</P>
<P>While guidelines for PCP prophylaixs among HIV patients (<LINK REF="REF-Panel-HIV-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panel HIV 2013</LINK>) are specific and universally accepted, there is a lack of consensus on prophylaxis in other immunocompromised people. Current guidelines for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation recommend that allogeneic recipients receive PCP prophylaxis from engraftment until at least six months after the transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Tomblyn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomblyn 2009</LINK>). Some experts initiate PCP prophylaxis prior to transplantation, depending on the underlying disease and the pretransplant conditioning regimens or prior chemotherapy. Prophylaxis is recommended for longer than six months in patients who continue to receive immunosuppressive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Tomblyn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomblyn 2009</LINK>). The rate of PCP in autologous stem cell transplant recipients is much lower than among allogeneic recipients and prophylaxis is recommended only for specific high-risk populations, such as patients with multiple myeloma, or following treatment with purine analogues or high-dose corticosteroids. The duration of PCP prophylaxis in this setting has not been evaluated, but common practice is to extend prophylaxis to three to six months post-transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Tomblyn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomblyn 2009</LINK>). Among other hematologic and solid cancer patients an increased risk of PCP was found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), prolonged CD4 counts of less than 200/&#956;L, or long term treatment with steroids. Prophylaxis is recommended for the duration of therapy or until the CD4 count is &gt; 200/&#956;L (<LINK REF="REF-Neumann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 2013</LINK>). The risk status is less conclusive in patients treated with standard or salvage regimens for lymphoma, and patients with prolonged neutropenia or acute myeloid leukemia. Some experts suggest prophylaxis for the duration of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Neumann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 2013</LINK>). Guidelines for solid organ transplant recipients recommend anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis for all recipients for at least six to 12 months post-transplant, though longer durations can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>). For lung and small bowel transplant recipients, as well as any transplant patient with a history of prior PCP infection or chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, lifelong prophylaxis may be indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>). In addition, PCP prophylaxis is recommended for kidney transplant recipients for at least six weeks during and after treatment for acute rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2010</LINK>). It is suggested that patients with inflammatory bowel disease receive prophylaxis if treated with three immunomodulatory drugs including a calcineurin inhibitor or anti-TNF therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rahier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahier 2009</LINK>). Other populations in whom experts suggest considering prophylaxis include (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2010</LINK>):</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Since PCP is relatively rare and prevention entails the use of drugs with significant adverse effects, it is important to document the risk-benefit profile of PCP chemoprophylaxis. It is necessary to define the effects of PCP chemoprophylaxis for the different drugs available and different patient populations at different risk levels for PCP. In the previous version of this review we showed that TMP/SMX results in a 91% reduction in the occurrence of PCP compared to no treatment (95% confidence interval 68% to 98%), with few adverse events reported in the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007a</LINK>). We have conducted an update of the aforementioned review.</P>

<P>Assessment of risk of bias in each study was performed independently by two authors (HG and MP in the original review and AS and MP in the update). An individual component approach to quality assessment was undertaken using the following variables: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data) and reporting bias (selective reporting). The grading of the specific risks of bias was expressed as &#8216;Low risk&#8217;, &#8216;High risk&#8217; or &#8216;Unclear risk&#8217; of bias using the criteria suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Ten trials, including 1000 patients, were included in this comparison. No events occurred in four trials. Only one case of PCP occurred in the prophylaxis arms. There was a significant reduction in the occurrence of PCP infections in the TMP/SMX prophylaxis group compared to the other groups, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Minor heterogeneity was present within this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%, P = 0.23). The number of patients needed to treat to prevent one episode of PCP was 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42) with a control event rate (CER) of 31/497 (6.2%). The funnel plot demonstrated a similar SE for trials with different effects, with no small study effect. The quality of the evidence for PCP prevention was graded as moderate, being downgraded only for possible risk of bias related to unknown randomisation methods for most trials and lack of blinding in half of the trials (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In four trials no events occurred, in both arms.</P>
<P>Seven trials, including 707 patients, compared daily administered TMP/SMX prophylaxis versus no intervention or placebo. Prophylaxis resulted in a decrease in the occurrence of PCP infections, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 1,0). Total events were 26 out of 335 in the no treatment or placebo group compared to 1 out of 372 in the TMP/SMX group. Four trials compared TMP/SMX prophylaxis versus a non-antiPCP antibiotic (quinolones). One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Vesole-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Vesole 2012</LINK>) was a three armed trial and was already included in the TMX/SMX versus no intervention analysis, and was thus excluded from this category of the meta-analysis.

<P>Four trials comparing TMP/SMX prophylaxis versus no intervention or placebo reported on the occurrence of any type of adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). These studies included 470 patients. There was no significant difference in the adverse effects rate between the two groups, RR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.24). Three trials reported adverse events that required discontinuation of the treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) and five trials reported on severe adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation, as defined in our protocol (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). No severe adverse events or adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation were reported with TMP/SMX, while several events were reported with placebo or no treatment. It should be noted that adverse events were caused by underlying conditions or chemotherapy as well as by TMP/SMX. The quality of the evidence for this outcome was rated as moderate due to imprecision.</P>
<P>Two trials comparing TMP/SMX prophylaxis versus quinolones reported on any adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). These trials included 191 patients.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>TMP/SMX was the antibiotic most commonly assessed for prevention of PCP infections, thus the review addressed mainly the efficacy of TMP/SMX. Overall, TMP/SMX was highly effective in preventing PCP infections, showing a 85% reduction in the incidence of PCP infections (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62) without significant heterogeneity. All cause mortality was not significantly reduced with prophylaxis (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.8) but since there were fewer PCP infections, PCP-related mortality was reduced by 83% (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94).</P>
<P>There was an advantage for TMP/SMX prophylaxis over no treatment in preventing bacterial infections (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.90) in the populations assessed in the included trials. Quinolone treatment was significantly better than TMP/SMX in preventing any infection other than PCP (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.96) but not specifically bacterial infections (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.23).</P>
<P>No difference was encountered between once versus thrice weekly prophylaxis with TMP/SMX for all outcomes described above, but few trials were included in this comparison. According to these results, there is no superiority for daily prophylaxis over thrice weekly prophylaxis with TMP/SMX.</P>
<P>For adverse effects, a meta-analysis of four trials showed no difference between TMP/SMX and no prophylaxis (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.24), while two trials comparing TMP/SMX to quinolone prophylaxis showed more adverse effects with TMP/SMX (RR 4.66, 95% CI 2.55 to 8.53). Among trials comparing TMP/SMX to placebo or no treatment, no severe adverse events were observed with TMP/SMX. Overall, combining all TMP/SMX treatment arms included in this systematic review, severe adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or severe dermatological reactions, occurred in 3.1% of adults (six trials) and 0% among children (five trials). The adverse effect most important to the patient population assessed in these trials (hematological cancer patients and organ transplant recipients) is leukopenia. There was a greater risk of leukopenia in the TMP/SMX group when compared to placebo or no intervention (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.50) and when comparing with quinolones (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.18 to 20.97). However, only four trials were included in these comparisons. Longer duration of neutropenia was reported with TMP/SMX treatment compared to quinolone treatment but, again, only the minority of trials reported this outcome and the data could not be combined.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The trials included in this review assessed patients with hematological malignancies, bone marrow transplant patients (five trials with children, three trials with adults) or solid organ transplant recipients (four trials). The overall rate of PCP infections in these studies was 6.2%, and for this control event rate the number needed to treat in order to prevent one PCP infection is 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Our results apply to populations with a similar risk of PCP infections.</P>
<P>Among most cancer patients rates are usually below 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Roux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roux 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 2002</LINK>). Higher rates are observed among patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Reported rates were 5% to 16% before the use of PCP prophylaxis, declining to 1.5% to 2.5% with the widespread use of TMP/SMX prophylaxis in this population (<LINK REF="REF-De-Castro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Castro 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roblot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roblot 2002</LINK>). The risk of PCP in patients with autologous stem cell transplantation is unknown. In a study from France, the incidence of PCP in patients with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was 0.54% (<LINK REF="REF-Roblot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roblot 2002</LINK>). In solid organ transplant patients, without prophylaxis the rate of PCP ranges from 5% to 15%. Among lung and heart-lung transplant recipients the rates are high, ranging from 10% to 40% without prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 2002</LINK>). PCP occurs in 1% to 2% of all patients with rheumatologic disorders, most often, but not always, among those receiving immunosuppressive therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1999</LINK>). Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, and to a lesser degree polymyositis or dermatomyositis are at higher risk, with incidence rates of 8% to 12%, 6.5% and 2.7%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Roux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roux 2014</LINK>). While the risk among patients with inflammatory bowel disease is higher than the general population, it is low in absolute terms (about 1/1000), and most patients who are affected receive steroids combined with other immunosuppressive medications (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 2002</LINK>). PCP has been described among other patients who have been administered chronic steroid treatment for autoimmune disease, dermatological diseases, chronic pulmonary disease and hematological malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Raychaudhuri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raychaudhuri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Worth 2005</LINK>). In a retrospective analysis from the Mayo Clinic, the median steroid dose was equivalent to 30 mg of prednisone and the median duration of treatment before the development of PCP was 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Yale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yale 1996</LINK>). Recently, reports of PCP among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease who are receiving anti-TNFalfa antibodies have been described, but the incidence rates are lower than 0.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Ellerin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellerin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roux 2014</LINK>). Outbreaks with suspected airborne person-to-person transmission have been documented in high-risk units, increasing the risk for individuals exposed above their baseline risk (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nankivell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankivell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostved-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostved 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yazaki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazaki 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Most of the studies used for this review are old (eight out of 13 were published from 1977 to 1990) and included a small number of patients. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Arning-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arning 1990</LINK>) included patients more than once in the trial, for different neutropenic episodes, and we did not have the data to adjust for clustering. The 95% CI for this trial might be artificially narrow and the weight assigned to it in the meta-analysis artificially high. The confidence in the main results was low to moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) due to unclear risk of bias in most trials and imprecision of results, mainly for all cause mortality, which was reported in a selection of the trials only.</P>
<P>These trials could not assess the effect of TMP/SMX prophylaxis on development of <I>Pneumocystis jirovecii</I> resistance to TMP/SMX or clinical failure with TMP/SMX treatment following TMP/SMX prophylaxis since only one infection occurred in the prophylaxis group. Among HIV patients, a previous systematic review showed that TMP/SMX prophylaxis was significantly associated with mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) enzyme of <I>Pneumocystis spp</I>. (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2004</LINK>). Clinically, the relationship between DHPS mutations and failure of TMP/SMX treatment is unclear; studies show results that are highly heterogeneous, which precludes an appraisal of the effect of TMP/SMX prophylaxis on clinical resistance to treatment of subsequent PCP with TMP/SMX (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2004</LINK>). In one study that evaluated 152 episodes of PCP in 144 HIV patients, DHPS mutations were found to be an independent predictor associated with increased death rates. Whether this increased death rate was due to failure of TMP/SMX for PCP treatment is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Helweg_x002d_Larsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helweg-Larsen 1999</LINK>). In a different study, among 97 patients with AIDS and PCP the presence of DHPS mutations was associated with an increased risk for PCP treatment failure (RR 2.1, P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="REF-Kazanjian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazanjian 2000</LINK>). In contrast, other studies found no association between the presence of DHPS mutations and mortality or PCP treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Navin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabodonirina-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabodonirina 2013</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Data from this review are insufficient to address the overall gain versus detrimental effects associated with TMP/SMX prophylaxis since we limited inclusion to trials that assessed PCP infections. Thus, our comparisons for all cause mortality, infections other than PCP, bacterial infections and adverse events are incomplete.</P>
<P>Publication bias is of concern since almost all trials showed absolute PCP protection with TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX, available in the US since 1973 and in the UK since 1969, was no longer a patented drug at the time most of these trials were conducted. Most commonly PCP was not the primary outcome, thus intentional bias is unlikely. For these reasons we do not believe that our results are due to publication bias, though some effect cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>A clinical question that is raised when considering TMP/SMX prophylaxis, mainly among cancer patients, is the adjunctive administration of leucovorin (folinic acid) to prevent myelosuppression. It is unclear whether leucovorin can prevent TMP/SMX-induced neutropenia, and whether it interferes with the efficacy of TMP/SMX. No studies examining this question in non-HIV patients were found. A randomised controlled trial compared tolerance to prophylaxis with TMP-SMX versus TMP-SMX with leucovorin in patients with advanced HIV. There was a non-significantly lower rate of leucopenia in recipients of leucovorin compared to patients who did not receive leucovorin (rate ratio 0.2, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.7) but there was no difference in discontinuation of the prophylaxis. Clinical efficacy was not addressed in this study (<LINK REF="REF-Bozzette-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozzette 1995</LINK>). In a randomised trial evaluating the ability of leucovorin to reduce TMP/SMX-induced toxicity in the treatment of acute PCP in 92 AIDS patients, a significant reduction in neutropenia was noted in patients receiving leucovorin (23% versus 47%, P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="REF-Safrin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safrin 1994</LINK>). However, leucovorin also resulted in a reduction in treatment efficacy (15% versus 0% failures, P = 0.005; 11% versus 0% deaths, P = 0.02 for leucovorin versus placebo). Thus, the overall benefit-risk of administering leucovorin concomitantly with TMP/SMX for prophylaxis is unclear for HIV patients and there are no data for non-HIV patients.</P>

<P>A Cochrane systematic review assessed TMP/SMX prophylaxis among adults with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Grimwade-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimwade 2005</LINK>). In three randomised controlled trials comparing TMP/SMX versus placebo or no treatment, no PCP events occurred and mortality was significantly reduced with prophylaxis. In a single trial comparing TMP/SMX with leucovorin versus no treatment among patients with HIV who were not on antiretroviral therapy and were receiving chemotherapy for Kaposi sarcoma, PCP infections were significantly reduced with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.74). In two trials of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for children with HIV, mortality was significantly reduced with prophylaxis in both trials; in one trial PCP was not reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mermin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermin 2004</LINK>) and in the other a single case of PCP occurred in the placebo group (<LINK REF="REF-Chintu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chintu 2004</LINK>). Thus, among HIV patients TMP/SMX prophylaxis significantly reduces mortality, and PCP infections were not always examined. In our review, TMP/SMX prophylaxis prevented PCP infections and PCP-related mortality.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-09-22 10:48:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Our review shows that TMP/SMX prophylaxis is highly effective for prevention of PCP in patients with hematological malignancies, bone marrow transplantation and solid organ transplantation, both for children and adults. The overall prevalence of severe adverse events with TMP/SMX was low and did not result in treatment discontinuations. Given the observed efficacy of TMP/SMX with regard to PCP prevention, prophylactic TMP/SMX should be considered when the risk of PCP is above the rate we observed (6.2% overall). Clinical conditions in which the rates of PCP for patients not receiving prophylaxis might be above 6.2% include the following (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2004</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, during the six months post-transplantation and afterwards with continued immunosuppression.</LI>
<LI>Solid organ transplantation, in the first six months after transplantation.</LI>
<LI>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The PCP incidence is probably lower for most patients with solid malignancies. Patients receiving corticosteroids for primary or metastatic brain tumours may be at a higher risk warranting prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 1993</LINK>). Among patients with collagen vascular diseases, only Wegener's granulomatosis has been associated with PCP rates above 2.5%. Quantitative incidence or relative risk data are lacking for patients treated with corticosteroids for chronic lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological conditions or other conditions. Similarly, incidence data are lacking for acute myeloid leukemia, treatment with anti-TNF agents, and newer biological treatments for hematological malignancies. During outbreaks of PCP among immunocompromised patients the incidence of PCP might be high enough to justify prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Using the data from our review and data available from studies conducted among HIV-positive patients, TMP/SMX may be administered thrice weekly as the efficacy is similar to once daily administration. The adult dose of TMP/SMX most commonly administered in our review was 160/800 mg.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-09-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Treatment with steroids for more than a month, in a dose equivalent to 20 mg of prednisone or more, may be a risk factor for the development of PCP (<LINK REF="REF-Yale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yale 1996</LINK>). Patients with collagen vascular diseases or inflammatory bowel disease receiving other immunosuppressive medication (including anti-TNFalfa antibodies) are also at risk. Trials are needed for this large population of patients. Documentation of the actual adverse event rate associated with prophylaxis in clinical practice, especially leukopenia, will assist future decisions regarding prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. The effect of prophylaxis on Pneumocystis resistance should be assessed in longitudinal studies or when TMP/SMX prophylaxis is used in practice.<BR/>
