<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:11:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review compared the coblation method with other methods of tonsil removal to assess recovery following tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) is a very common operation. Patients may have pain for up to two weeks after surgery. Bleeding may occur either immediately after surgery ('primary bleeding' within 24 hours of surgery) or later ('secondary bleeding' more than 24 hours after surgery). There are many methods of tonsillectomy; the traditional method is with metal surgical instruments. Coblation is a new method where the surgeon uses an electrically powered handpiece that 'burns' tissues using low temperatures.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included evidence available up to April 2017. We included 29 studies, with a total of 2561 participants. All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias. Seven studies included adults, 16 studies included children and six included both adults and children.</P>
<P>Most studies measured pain using a patient-reported scale (for example, asking people to rate their pain on a scale of 1 to 10).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The coblation technique may cause slightly less pain one day after surgery and three days after surgery, but it is unlikely that there is a difference in pain seven days after surgery. We are very uncertain whether the amount of pain reduction observed in days 1 to 3 after surgery would be important to patients.</P>
<P>There is little or no difference in the risk of bleeding in the first day after surgery, but there may be a small increased risk of bleeding with coblation after the first day. For every 1000 patients having a tonsillectomy, 50 patients would have a bleed with coblation, compared to 36 with traditional surgical techniques.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence for the difference in pain is of <I>low or very low quality </I>and for the difference in bleeding after surgery it is of <I>low quality</I>. This means that we have little confidence in the results; the true effect may be very different - we simply do not know at this stage.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-26 09:34:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Tonsillectomy is a very common operation and is performed using various surgical methods. Coblation is a popular method because it purportedly causes less pain than other surgical methods. However, the superiority of coblation is unproven.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-06-19 09:47:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To compare the effects of coblation tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy with other surgical techniques, both hot and cold, on intraoperative morbidity, postoperative morbidity and procedural cost.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-10 09:41:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 April 2017.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-06-19 09:48:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children and adults undergoing tonsillectomy with coblation compared with any other surgical technique. This review is limited to trials of extracapsular (traditional) tonsillectomy and excludes trials of intracapsular tonsil removal (tonsillotomy).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-10 09:33:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We used the standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: patient-reported pain using a validated pain scale at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7; intraoperative blood loss; primary postoperative bleeding (within 24 hours) and secondary postoperative bleeding (more than 24 hours after surgery). Secondary outcomes were: time until resumption of normal diet, time until resumption of normal activity, duration of surgery and adverse effects including blood transfusion and the need for reoperation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in <I>italics</I>.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:11:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We included 29 studies, with a total of 2561 participants. All studies had moderate or high risk of bias. Sixteen studies used an adequate randomisation technique, however the inability to mask the surgical teams and/or provide adequate methods to mitigate the risk of bias put nearly all studies at moderate or high risk of detection and measurement bias for intraoperative blood loss, and primary and secondary bleeding. In contrast most studies (20) were at low risk of bias for pain assessment. Most studies did not report data in a manner permitting meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Most studies did not clearly report the participant characteristics, surgical indications or whether patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Most studies reported that tonsillitis (infection) and/or tonsillar hypertrophy (obstruction) were the indication for surgery. Seven studies included only adults, 16 studies included only children and six studies included both.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Pain</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>At postoperative day 1 there is <I>very low quality evidence </I>that patients in the coblation group had less pain, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.38 to -0.19; 538 participants; six studies). This effect is reduced a SMD of -0.44 (95% CI -0.97 to 0.09; 401 participants; five studies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) at day 3, and at day 7 there is <I>low quality evidence </I>of little or no difference in pain (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.19; 420 participants; five studies). Although this suggests that pain may be slightly less in the coblation group between days 1 and 3, the clinical significance is unclear.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Intraoperative blood loss</B>

</P>
<P>Methodological differences between studies in the measurement of intraoperative blood loss precluded meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Primary and secondary bleeding</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>The risk of primary bleeding was similar (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.05; 2055 participants; 25 studies; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). The risk of secondary bleeding was greater in the coblation group with a risk ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.95; 2118 participants; 25 studies; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Using the median of the control group as the baseline risk, the absolute risk in the coblation group was 5% versus 3.6% in the control group. The difference of 1.3% has a 95% CI of 0.2% lower in the coblation group to 3.5% higher.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Differences in study design and data reporting precluded the identification of differences in the time to resumption of normal diet or activity, or whether there was a difference in the duration of surgery.</P>
<P>Although we could not feasibly compare the costs of equipment or operative facility, anaesthetic and surgical fees across different healthcare systems we used duration of surgery as a proxy for cost. Although this outcome was commonly reported in studies, it was not possible to pool the data to determine whether there was a difference.</P>
<P>Adverse events other than bleeding were not well reported. It is unclear whether there is a difference in postoperative infections or the need for reoperation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:11:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The coblation technique may cause less pain on postoperative day 1, but the difference is small and may be clinically meaningless. By postoperative day 3, the difference decreases further and by postoperative day 7 there appears to be little or no difference. We found similar rates of primary bleeding but we cannot rule out a small increased risk of secondary bleeding with coblation. The evidence supporting these findings is of <I>low </I>or <I>very low quality</I>, i.e. there is a very high degree of uncertainty about the results. Moreover, for most outcomes data were only available from a few of the 29 included studies.</P>
<P>The current evidence is of very low quality, therefore it is uncertain whether or not the coblation technique has any advantages over traditional tonsillectomy techniques. Despite the large number of studies, failure to use standardised or validated outcome measures precludes the ability to pool data across studies. Therefore, well-conducted RCTs using consistent, validated outcome measures are needed to establish whether the coblation technique has a benefit over other methods. In the included studies we identified no clear difference in adverse events. However, given the rarity of these events, randomised trials lack the power to detect a difference. Data from large-scale registries will provide a better estimate of any difference in these rare outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-27 10:45:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:16:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures, with the number of tonsillectomies performed per year increasing over recent decades (<LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2009</LINK>). Most tonsillectomies are performed for recurrent tonsillitis or adenotonsillar hypertrophy that results in sleep-disordered breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Baugh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baugh 2011</LINK>). The procedure is performed in both adults and children and is associated with significant postoperative morbidity. Multiple surgical techniques are used in practice, without consensus on the optimal technique or instrumentation.</P>
<P>Tonsillectomy entails complete removal of the palatine tonsils through dissection in the peritonsillar space. The procedure is often combined with adenoidectomy (surgical removal of the adenoid tissue from the nasopharynx), especially when the procedure is performed for the surgical management of sleep-disordered breathing.</P>
<P>Although commonly performed, tonsillectomy is associated with significant morbidity. The risks of the procedure include the risks of general anaesthesia and risks specific to tonsillectomy. The most common risks specific to the procedure are pain and postoperative bleeding. Postoperative bleeding may occur in the immediate postoperative period or in a delayed fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharyya-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharyya 2014</LINK>). Postoperative pain lasts approximately two weeks and may delay resumption of normal activity and diet with the risk of dehydration. In severe cases, postoperative pain may result in delayed discharge, an emergency department visit or readmission for pain control and hydration.</P>
<P>Bleeding following tonsillectomy is a potentially fatal complication. The National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit (NPTA) collected information on 33,921 patients undergoing tonsillectomy in England and Northern Ireland over a 14-month period in 2003 to 2004. The primary (within 24 hours) and secondary (after 24 hours) bleeding rates were 0.6% and 3% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-BAO_x002d_HNS_x002f_RCSENG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAO-HNS/RCSENG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Meulen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Meulen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The morbidity associated with adenoidectomy is much less than that associated with tonsillectomy and for this reason trials of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy are included in this review. When relevant outcomes were expected to differ between groups based on their adenoidectomy status, we planned subgroup analysis. Surgical indication does not determine tonsillectomy technique, therefore we did not plan subgroup analysis based on indication.</P>
<P>Several techniques for tonsillectomy exist and their relative effectiveness is debated. The technique chosen often depends on the surgeon's personal preference.</P>
<P>The techniques employed for tonsillectomy include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cold dissection: the peritonsillar space is dissected with metal instruments, with bleeding typically controlled by ligation or electrocautery.</LI>
<LI>Hot dissection: an instrument delivering thermal energy is used to dissect the peritonsillar space. Examples include:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>electrosurgery: radiofrequency energy is applied via means of an instrument, with the resulting heat providing control of bleeding and dissection of tissues;</LI>
<LI>quantum molecular resonance: electrical energy is used to deliver energy quanta that divide tissue by breaking molecular bonds at low temperatures (&lt; 50ºC) (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Agostino-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Agostino 2008</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>coblation (see below).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-27 10:45:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Coblation (cold ablation, cool ablation, ionised field ablation, plasma-mediated ablation, radiofrequency ablation or low-temperature plasma excision) is a tonsillectomy technique first developed for use in orthopaedic surgery. Coblation is an example of high-frequency electrosurgery. The technique involves passing radiofrequency energy through a conductive medium (such as isotonic sodium chloride) producing a plasma field. The resultant energetic charge-carrying ions have sufficient energy to break organic molecular bonds, resulting in low-temperature (40ºC to 70ºC compared with &gt; 100ºC in electrosurgery) molecular disintegration of the tissue. A bipolar probe, known as a coblation wand, is used to accomplish the dissection. The low operating temperatures purportedly cause less postoperative pain compared with techniques involving higher temperatures (<LINK REF="STD-Timms-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Timms 2002</LINK>). Many coblation devices also coagulate bleeding vessels.</P>
<P>This review only includes studies that describe tonsillectomy (also known as extracapsular tonsillectomy or total tonsillectomy) and excludes studies that describe tonsillotomy (also known as intracapsular tonsillectomy or partial tonsillectomy). Tonsillectomy refers to an extracapsular dissection to completely remove the palatine tonsil, leaving bare pharyngeal musculature (the authors acknowledge that the tissue is part of Waldeyer's ring and can be contiguous with the lingual tonsillar tissue). In contrast, tonsillotomy leaves a rim of tonsillar tissue and does not expose pharyngeal musculature. While there is a risk of imprecision with the terminology, this review relies on the terms and descriptions of the procedures provided in the studies and we clarified this with study authors when needed.</P>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-17 00:52:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the purported advantages of coblation involve the low-temperature dissection of tissue afforded while preserving haemostasis, we planned subgroup analyses based on the cold versus hot dissection techniques as listed above. Hot techniques are those in which an instrument delivers thermal energy to the tissue in order to facilitate tissue dissection. Similarly, we planned to evaluate intraoperative bleeding, as this outcome is dependent on the technique employed for tonsil removal.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 11:09:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the<I> Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2007</LINK>). The prior review identified insufficient evidence to conclude whether use of coblation provides a benefit over other tonsillectomy techniques. Evidence on this topic would help clinicians to select a technique for tonsillectomy. Recently, concerns about the metabolism of narcotic analgesia in paediatric patients has heightened awareness of postoperative pain in children (<LINK REF="REF-Ciszkowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciszkowski 2009</LINK>). A technique that offers less morbidity, perhaps less pain, less bleeding or a shorter duration of surgery would have obvious advantages for the patient and healthcare systems.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-08-16 14:27:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Barring excessive clinical heterogeneity, we pooled treatment results across studies. We expressed treatment differences for dichotomous outcomes (proportion of patients with postoperative bleeding) as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also expressed the results in the 'Summary of findings' table as absolute effects with 95% CIs based on the pooled results and compared to the assumed risk. This assumed baseline risk is typically either (a) the median of the risks of the control groups in the included studies, this being used to represent a 'medium-risk population' or, alternatively, (b) the average risk of the control groups in the included studies is used as the 'study population' (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>). Should further studies be added in future updates it may also be appropriate to consider assumed baseline risk in (c) a low-risk population and (d) a high-risk population.</P>
<P>We expressed treatment effects for continuous scales as the mean difference (MD) with standard deviation (SD) or if different scales were used to measure the same outcome, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>

<P>Many studies contained unclear methods and reported insufficient results. We systematically attempted to contact study authors for clarification and to obtain critical data such as point estimates or variance estimates necessary for meta-analysis. We did not plan imputations for missing data, apart from standard calculations to obtain SD values for continuous data as detailed in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>). We extracted and analysed all data using the available case analysis method, with the exception of data for secondary bleeding. We assumed that every patient with clinically relevant secondary bleeding would seek emergency help. Therefore, for this outcome we used the number randomised as the denominator. We excluded from the meta-analysis studies with insufficient data to permit calculation of SD values. These studies are included in qualitative analysis only.</P>

<P>Clinical and statistical heterogeneity are distinct concepts that we analysed separately. We assessed clinical heterogeneity by considering between-study differences in the patients, surgical interventions and outcome measures. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visually inspecting the forest plots and considering the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (with a significance level set at P &lt; 0.10) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which calculates the percentage of variability that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance, with I<SUP>2</SUP> values over 50% suggesting substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>).</P>

</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes reporting bias (within-study reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed within-study reporting bias by comparing the outcomes reported in the published report against the study protocol, if available. In the absence of a study protocol, we compared the outcomes listed in the methods section of each study with the results reported. If results were reported in a manner insufficient for meta-analysis we sought further information from the study authors. For example, many studies reported that a result was 'significant' without providing a point estimate or variance. Frequently we had insufficient information to judge the risk of bias and rated this as 'unclear' risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We drew funnel plots (plots of the effect estimates versus the inverse of their standard errors (SE)) when sufficient studies (&gt; 10) were available. Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias or bias related to sample size, although asymmetry may also represent a true relationship between study size and size of treatment effect. We planned a formal investigation of the degree of asymmetry with the method proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK> using the StatsDirect software.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-07-10 12:08:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>In the absence of excessive clinical heterogeneity, we pooled data across studies to calculate a summary measure of effect (see <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK>).</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, we planned to analyse pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate a risk ratio (RR) or using time-to-event analysis to calculate a hazard ratio (HR). In this review, time-to-event analysis would have been suitable for time to resumption of normal diet or activities.</P>
<P>For continuous data, we planned to analyse pooled data using the inverse variance method. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) as summary measures of effect. We used the MD if the unit of outcome was measured consistently across studies. We used the SMD if there was inconsistency across studies. Of note, the SMD does not automatically account for differences in the direction of scales, but the analysis of our outcomes is not impacted by this issue.</P>
<P>For most outcomes we planned to use a random-effects meta-analysis method (DerSimonian and Laird), theorising that the outcomes between different surgical techniques for tonsillectomy are not the same between surgeons and across patient populations due to unmeasured differences in patients, institutions and surgical techniques. Random-effects versus fixed-effect methods yield trivial differences when statistical heterogeneity is low. However, when statistical heterogeneity is high a random-effects method provides a more conservative estimate of the difference. When possible, we planned to differentiate between 'statistically significant' and 'clinically significant' findings. We performed all meta-analyses with Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>We identified possible effect modifiers a priori for subgroup analyses:</P>

<LI>Comparator technique of tonsillectomy ('hot' versus 'cold' techniques).</LI>
<LI>Patient age (children versus adults).</LI>
<LI>Type of surgery (tonsillectomy only versus tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the subgroup analysis based on tonsillectomy technique used in the control group, we considered monopolar cautery, bipolar cautery, molecular resonance, laser, PlasmaKnife and harmonic scalpel as hot techniques because there is at least some heat associated with the procedure. If there were sufficient studies we had planned to conduct individual subgroup analysis for each technique (monopolar, bipolar, molecular resonance, harmonic scalpel).</P>
<P>Where data from adults and children were separable, we planned to analyse them as subgroups provided this would not break the randomisation (e.g. studies with stratified randomisation for adults versus children). Otherwise studies that enrolled both adults and children would be considered 'mixed' unless one of the group predominated; e.g. if 80% of patients in a study were children, this study would have been grouped as 'children'.</P>

<P>We planned sensitivity analyses to determine whether the findings were robust to decisions made in the course of identifying, screening and analysing the studies. We planned to evaluate these factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Impact of model chosen: fixed-effect versus random-effects model.</LI>
<LI>Source of data: published versus unpublished studies for which data were obtained solely from abstracts/personal communication.</LI>
<LI>Risk of bias of included studies:</LI>

<LI>selection bias: studies with high risk of bias for methods of allocation concealment and randomisation;</LI>
<LI>attrition bias: loss to follow-up &gt; 10%, or differential loss to follow-up between treatment arms.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Method of measurement for duration of surgery and operative blood loss. For example, in many studies it was unclear whether the reported measures of duration of surgery or blood loss included the time and blood loss from concurrent adenoidectomy. Similarly, many studies did not indicate how intraoperative blood loss was assessed for the coblation group and did not specify whether the volume of saline irrigant, required for coblation, was subtracted from the measured blood loss.</LI>
<LI>Clinical factors: surgical indication - the effect of infection versus obstruction.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings'</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we used in the interpretation of the results. There are four possible quality ratings: 'high', 'moderate', 'low' and 'very low'. A rating of 'high quality' implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the effect estimate. A rating of 'very low' quality implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs without serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of each of these factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>study limitations (risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>inconsistency</LI>
<LI>indirectness of evidence</LI>
<LI>imprecision</LI>
<LI>publication bias</LI>

<P>We included a 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) constructed according to the recommendations described in Chapter 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>). We used the GRADE considerations to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome and to draw conclusions about the quality of evidence in the review. We included six outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table: pain on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7, intraoperative blood loss, primary bleeding and secondary bleeding.</P>

<P>In all 29 studies coblation tonsillectomy was performed using equipment manufactured by ArthroCare Corporation, as judged by the terms and descriptions provided by the study authors. The technique of tonsillectomy in the control groups varied between studies and within some individual studies different techniques were used for tonsil excision and haemostasis. We broadly classified comparison techniques as either 'cold' or 'hot'. We included in the 'cold' comparison techniques studies of traditional surgical dissection ('cold steel') followed by diathermy for haemostasis.</P>
<P>In most studies it was unclear whether or not concurrent adenoidectomy was performed. This important information was lacking from studies that enrolled patients with tonsillar hypertrophy or obstructive symptoms - reasons for which patients might commonly undergo concurrent adenoidectomy with tonsillectomy.</P>

However, most studies adapted or implemented the scales in a manner that <I>may</I> have invalidated them. For example, many studies changed the numeric reference points for the Wong Baker FACES scale to 0 to 5 rather than 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eredit_x00e0_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eredità 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eredit_x00e0_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eredità 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elbadawey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Elbadawey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paramasivan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Paramasivan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stoker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>). Similarly, many studies that used a VAS changed the anchor points to 0 to 4, 0 to 6 or 1 to 5 rather than 0 to 100 (<LINK REF="STD-Anthony-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Anthony 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayasinghe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jayasinghe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Matin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mitic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Temple-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Temple 2001</LINK>). Perhaps of greatest concern is that although the VAS has not been validated in children, many studies used it to assess pain in children as young as three or four years old (<LINK REF="STD-Anthony-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Anthony 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustavii-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gustavii 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Matin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mitic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Omrani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Omrani 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Temple-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Temple 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our protocol we stated that we would compare pain using validated pain scales only. However, we chose to include in the meta-analysis studies that measured pain using a scale that was largely based on a validated pain scale. Thus we included studies that used a VAS regardless of anchor points and we used studies using the Wong Baker FACES scale regardless of the numbers assigned to the scale.</P>
<P>Some studies collected data with a validated scale but reported the data in a manner that precluded meta-analysis, such as collecting continuous data but reporting it categorically, reporting data without a mean or variance estimate, or reporting an aggregate pain rating over several days.</P>

<P>Two important sources of uncertainty impacted nearly all of the studies. First, saline irrigation is necessary for coblation technology and the volume of saline irrigant confounds measurement of intraoperative blood loss, yet only two studies reported subtracting the volume of saline irrigant from the total volume of aspirate in the suction canister (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eredit_x00e0_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eredità 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paramasivan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Paramasivan 2012</LINK>). Second, in children undergoing adenoidectomy as well as tonsillectomy some blood loss is related to the former procedure and most studies provided no indication as to whether the blood loss from tonsillectomy was measured separately from that from the adenoidectomy. However, when randomisation is adequate, both groups within a study should include a similar proportion of patients with concurrent adenoidectomy and the additional blood loss from the adenoidectomy would be balanced between the two groups.</P>
<P>This uncertainty means that the outcome reflects an estimate of the collection of various intraoperative fluids rather than a precise measure of blood loss.</P>

We sought further information from the senior author (Rachmanidou); she confirmed that randomisation for this study was "not formal", as patients on one consultant's waiting list were operated on using coblation, whilst patients under the care of other consultants were operated on using cold dissection or bipolar diathermy. She also confirmed that the study was not blinded. We therefore concluded that this was not a randomised controlled trial and excluded it from the review.</P>

<P>We assigned an overall risk of performance bias and detection bias for each study based on this review's primary outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Personnel</HEADING>
<P>Many studies reported that all procedures in both groups were performed by a single surgeon. We carefully considered whether a surgeon's attitude toward coblation might bias performance, particularly if the surgeon performs the procedures in both groups. No study described any steps taken to mitigate against possible surgeon bias, such as randomising patients to treatment groups wherein all of the procedures in the coblation group are performed by a surgeon who is a proponent of coblation and all of the procedures in the comparator group are performed by a similarly experienced surgeon who is a proponent of the comparator technique. Many studies also did not report whether steps were taken to blind the postoperative patient care team. For these reasons, performance bias is high for all outcomes across all studies. Detection bias is necessarily high for outcomes assessed by surgical personnel (primary and secondary bleeding, intraoperative blood loss and duration of surgery). However, provided the patients were blinded, detection bias is low for patient-reported outcomes (pain, return to normal diet and activity).</P>

<P>Sources of potential bias that are not included in other domains include early termination of the study, sponsorship by a device manufacturer, lack of clarity in describing the number of patients in groups, lack of publication and unexpectedly high rates of complications. There were two studies with rates of postoperative bleeding that were so much higher than the generally expected rate of bleeding in both the coblation and the comparison groups that we thought this signalled a potential problem (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bäck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philpott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Philpott 2005</LINK>).

<P>Conflict of interest is an important potential source of bias that was difficult to assess. One study stated that was supported by a grant from the ArthroCare Corporation (manufacturer of the coblation device) (<LINK REF="STD-Stoker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stoker 2004</LINK>).

However, most of the remaining studies were silent on this topic, as only three studies had explicit statements regarding any conflicts of interests of the investigators: all three stated that the study investigators had no conflicts to disclose (<LINK REF="STD-Mitic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mitic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roje-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Roje 2011</LINK>).

<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for the main comparison.</P>
<P>A variety of data reporting problems precluded us from including studies in the meta-analyses. Most studies did not provide any information related to the variance (e.g. standard deviations) for continuous outcomes such as pain or intraoperative blood loss. Many studies reported data graphically without accompanying numerical data, although when possible we interpreted means and standard deviations from the graphs. Other studies reported no data at all - no mean values, no variance estimates and no P values - and only reported that a finding either was or was not statistically significant. Some studies reported results without indicating whether they had used parametric or non-parametric tests. It is possible that studies with favourable results were more likely to provide detailed data and it is possible that selective reporting occurred. For this reason, we downgraded the quality of evidence for all outcomes in which less than half of the studies could be included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Although we included 29 studies in the review, most did not report data in a way that allowed for meta-analysis. When possible, we pooled data and conducted the planned subgroup analyses. For those outcomes in which less than half of the studies contributed data to the pooled meta-analysis, we also qualitatively reviewed the direction of effects obtained from the meta-analysis with the direction of effects in studies that had to be excluded from the meta-analysis due insufficient information.</P>
<P>Although we had planned to conduct three types of subgroup analyses (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>), we have only displayed the subgroup analysis by type of surgical technique used in the control group (cold versus hot techniques) and we could only carry out proper subgroup analysis for three outcomes: primary bleeding, secondary bleeding and duration of surgery. There were more studies reporting these outcomes, which are more easily reported in a consistent manner across studies (number of patients who had an event for bleeding, or minutes of time for duration of surgery). In contrast, other outcomes had many variations and limitations in the measurement and reporting methods used, resulting in very few data that could ultimately be included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The other two planned subgroup analyses based on type of surgery (tonsillectomy only versus adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy) and patient age (children versus adults) could not be conducted in a meaningful way (there were too few data and none showed statistical significance in the test of subgroup differences). Many studies did not report data in a manner that permitted allocation of patients into these subgroups.</P>
<P>We did not carry out planned sensitivity analyses based on risk of bias because for all outcomes the majority of the studies had either an unclear or high risk of bias, and there would have been insufficient studies with low risk of bias to constitute a meaningful sensitivity analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome (a) Pain as reported by patient</HEADING>
<P>Pain was reported using linear (visual analogue scale - VAS) and ordinal (Wong Baker FACES) scales and we analysed these with the standardised mean difference (SMD). Due to the high heterogeneity we used a random-effects model. We also considered whether to pool the data in the face of unresolved heterogeneity. Ultimately, we chose to do so because pain is a primary outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Postoperative pain, postoperative day 1</HEADING>
<P>Six studies contributed data to this meta-analysis, including one study that used hot tonsillectomy as a comparator and six studies that used cold tonsillectomy as a comparator (one study had both the cold and hot technique comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Elbadawey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Elbadawey 2015</LINK>). On postoperative day 1 the level of pain was lower in the coblation group (SMD -0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.38 to -0.19; 538 participants; six studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 90%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

When we excluded this study from the meta-analysis the effect size was smaller (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.17; 446 participants; five studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%).

There was no statistically significant difference in the level of pain between the coblation group and the hot technique group (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.11), nor between the coblation group and the cold technique group (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.26). There were too few studies available to conduct the planned subgroup investigations for high statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Among the 20 studies that could not be meta-analysed the results varied. Some studies found no statistically significant difference between coblation and the comparator technique; other studies found some benefit for coblation. Among the studies that reported at least some possible benefit for coblation, limitations in data reporting prevented us from determining how that difference in pain would have been experienced by the patient. For example, some studies compared pain on a daily basis, as we have done in this review. Other studies reported an aggregate pain score for the entire postoperative time period, and still others reported the number of days to resolution of pain (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>). Finally, most studies did not clarify whether a statistically significant difference would have been clinically significant.</P>
<P>It is difficult to interpret whether the observed effect estimates for postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 3 were of clinical significance. While it is commonly accepted that the minimal clinically important difference for chronic pain is a SMD of 0.5, the values are less well established for acute pain, particularly for post-surgical pain. We estimated that the observed differences on postoperative day 1 (a SMD of 0.79) are equivalent to about an 11 mm difference on a VAS (1 mm to 100 mm). However, some studies in emergency acute pain (non-surgical) suggest that the minimal clinically important difference on a VAS is 13 mm to 16 mm (<LINK REF="REF-Bijur-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeLoach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeLoach 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2002</LINK>). Thus, it is unclear whether the lower pain scores on postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 3 were of clinical importance. Moreover, there is very high uncertainty in this estimate based on the wide confidence intervals. We consider the quality of this evidence to be <I>very low</I> because of very serious limitations in study methodology including possible reporting biases, statistical heterogeneity, imprecision of the evidence based on the wide confidence intervals and publication bias based on the small proportion of studies that reported data in a manner that permitted meta-analysis. More importantly, there is a severe limitation in terms of uncertainty as to whether many of these studies used appropriately validated instruments to measure the pain outcome.</P>

<P>Of the 25 studies that reported at least one episode of postoperative bleeding, 19 (representing 1566 patients) also reported how the episodes of bleeding were managed.

Vomiting, dehydration, ear pain and velopharyngeal insufficiency are expected following tonsillectomy and were reported in multiple studies. These types of events are common following tonsillectomy and, for this reason, it seems that the different rates of adverse events across studies appear to be largely due to the rigour with which adverse events were defined and collected. One study additionally catalogued minor adverse events including mouth odour, cough, lethargy, confusion and dizziness, drooling and poor speech quality, recurrent pharyngitis, uvular haematoma, need for intravenous antibiotics and/or narcotics (fever, pain, nausea), throat discomfort lasting more than three months, snoring and altered taste (<LINK REF="STD-Gustavii-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gustavii 2010</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-26 14:27:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The studies in this review included relevant patient populations (children and adults undergoing surgery for infection or obstruction), although subgroup analyses were often not possible due to study design or data reporting. We included studies with all types of comparator technique for tonsillectomy, although some may debate the manner in which we categorised techniques as 'hot' or 'cold', particularly if the primary dissection technique was cold and haemostasis was performed with a hot technique.</P>
<P>The studies in this review directly evaluated outcomes important to patients and providers: postoperative pain, intraoperative blood loss and postoperative bleeding. Many studies also evaluated the impact of tonsillectomy on quality of life by measuring return to normal diet and activity. However, the studies in this review generally failed to collect and report these outcomes in a manner permitting meta-analysis. Although capturing charges from the physicians, operating and recovery rooms, and medical supplies was beyond the scope of the studies in this review, many studies measured duration of surgery and we used that measure as an imperfect proxy for cost. Unfortunately, the results were heterogeneous making it impossible to determine whether there may be a difference between coblation and other surgical techniques in the duration of surgery. In addition, not included in our proxy measure of cost is the additional cost of the coblation wand, which is a disposable handpiece, more expensive than a monopolar cautery handpiece. The data from the studies identified are of such uniformly low quality that we cannot conclude that one technique is favourable. This review is unable to compare the rate of primary and secondary haemorrhage as these are rare events and unlikely to be captured in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The frequency of such rare events is more appropriately evaluated in prospective registries such as the National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit conducted in England and Northern Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-BAO_x002d_HNS_x002f_RCSENG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAO-HNS/RCSENG 2005</LINK>) and the National Tonsil Surgery Registry conducted in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f6_derman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Söderman 2015</LINK>), as discussed in <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-15 11:22:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>As noted in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, we have <I>low</I> or <I>very low-quality</I> evidence for all of our outcomes.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, despite the 29 studies and 2561 participants included in this review, the body of evidence is of such low quality that it precludes robust conclusions. Key methodological limitations affecting many of the studies included serious study design flaws affecting randomisation, the inability to blind the surgeon and other personnel in a surgical trial, and the difficulty of blinding personnel responsible for reporting outcomes, such as duration of surgery, operative blood loss and postoperative bleeding. Outcomes, particularly those that need to be measured as continuous outcomes (pain, intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, return to diet and activity) were not consistently measured across studies. Pain was measured using different instruments and at different time points. It was often unclear whether a validated instrument was used. In addition, most studies did not clearly specify who had filled in the forms, i.e. whether these were filled in by parents, children or clinicians, or if this was supervised. In situations where blinding was unclear or lacking, this is an important risk of bias. The impact of this bias could potentially vary between different cultural and treatment settings and contribute to the high degree of unexplained heterogeneity observed. </P>
<P>Extreme statistical heterogeneity and methods of measurement/definition precluded pooling or meta-analysis for four outcomes: return to normal diet, return to normal activity, duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss. Different parameters were used to measure intraoperative blood loss, making it impossible to pool the results at all for interpretation. Definitions of 'return to normal diet' or 'normal activity' were often not available. These inconsistencies are likely to contribute to the high degree of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in the results. It is also possible that the heterogeneity observed in return to normal diet and return to normal activity may reflect differences in pre- or postoperative instructions about pain medication and how and when to resume normal diet and activities, as well as different cultural expectations and norms across populations. These factors may be difficult to standardise in future RCTs, but clear information about the relevant protocols or definition of measurements should be provided to allow for assessment.</P>
<P>In contrast, the heterogeneity observed in duration of surgery likely reflects non-standardised beginning and end time points. Similarly, the heterogeneity observed in operative blood loss is in part due to non-standardised measurement methods. Some studies painstakingly measured blood loss using paediatric volumetric canisters; others used the surgeon's estimates. Some studies carefully excluded from this estimate blood loss from associated adenoidectomy or saline irrigation from the coblation device. Ultimately, the great heterogeneity among the these outcomes precluded us from pooling the studies to obtain a summary measure of effect. However, these factors could be easily standardised in future RCTs. The small size of most of these studies also precludes identification of a true difference, if one exists. For these reasons, although there may be true differences between coblation and comparator techniques, with the current studies we are unable to detect a difference and cannot determine whether a summary measure for any of these outcomes would favour coblation or the comparator.</P>
<P>Many studies in this review had a limited follow-up duration: 15 of 29 studies had less than 14 days of follow-up, but most of these had at least 10 days of follow-up. Although many surgeons consider the patient to be at risk of secondary haemorrhage during the 14 days after surgery, this is not proven. While consistent follow-up of at least 14 days would theoretically have improved the completeness (i.e. total number of events, or absolute risk) of secondary haemorrhage events captured, there is no known difference in the timing of secondary haemorrhage for coblation tonsillectomy compared to other techniques (i.e. whether people who have coblation surgery are more likely to have late secondary haemorrhage events). Therefore, it is not likely that this shorter duration of follow-up will bias the result, which is measured as a relative risk. Finally, in this meta-analysis we found bleeding rates comparable to those of well-conducted registry studies, also indicating that this shorter duration of follow-up did not appreciably impact our results.</P>
<P>Imprecision is still a serious issue with the pooled estimates despite the review having more than 2500 participants from 29 studies. Studies also often did not report enough information to allow for meta-analysis, and the possibility of selective reporting bias for non-statistically significant results cannot be excluded. This is a major problem for the studies found in this review, as most of them are small and might not be powered to detect statistical significance. Most studies provided enough information about primary and secondary bleeding but the estimates for these outcomes still had wide confidence intervals due to the low event rates.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-17 09:55:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The greatest challenge faced by the review team was inconsistent outcome reporting across studies. The inconsistency affected how outcomes were defined, collected and reported, with differences in definitions, timing of measurement and choice of metrics. Some outcomes, such as pain, suffered further inconsistency because they were reported at inconsistent time points. As a result, there was no obvious choice as to which outcome measures could be used for meta-analysis. Through discussion we reached consensus on these topics prior to undertaking this review. We made this determination based on the importance of each outcome to patients, clinicians and decision-makers. If data were not fully reported or available in the format we required, we contacted the study authors. Despite an extensive systematic effort to contact authors, in most cases we were unable to obtain the required information and we had to exclude many studies from meta-analysis. The value of this pragmatic approach is that it minimises selective outcome reporting by the review team and minimises the risk of a type II error through multiple analyses.</P>
<P>We found six studies reported in languages other than English (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2006</LINK>). Although all of them were published as full-text manuscripts the methodology described in some of them is extremely limited (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2006</LINK>). We systematically attempted to contact the study authors by both email and post (organised through Cochrane ENT), but obtained no useful additional information. Although we were assisted by very able translators, it was often difficult to be certain about the type of data reported and as a result we were particularly concerned about including these studies in the meta-analyses. For example, many studies were unclear or contradictory about whether data were mean or median values. We were also concerned about whether standard deviation (SD) values were in fact SDs or standard errors (SEs). One of the studies affected, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>, had effect sizes that were larger than the other studies. We did query whether this was because the SD reported was actually a SE but after looking at the report carefully we concluded that this was unlikely. Firstly, if the values reported were SE then the SD estimated would be too large and for some of the data points implausible for the length of the scale used. Secondly, some data would no longer be statistically significant (as reported in the paper). We followed the recommendations within the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and included these studies in our analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>). Had we excluded these non-English studies, then we would have been at risk of selective reporting bias. We attempted sensitivity analysis by removing these and other studies at high risk of bias, but because nearly all of the studies were at high risk of bias this procedure was futile. For transparency to the reader, we have displayed the risks of bias alongside the forest plots.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-15 11:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Our finding that there is no clinically meaningful difference in pain is in agreement with a recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Xie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xie 2008</LINK>). This meta-analysis of four RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stoker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Temple-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Temple 2001</LINK>) compared coblation with monopolar cautery, ultrasonic scalpel and bipolar dissection. The authors concluded that "coblation tonsillectomy may be associated with less post-operative pain and a more rapid return to normal diet, though it is unclear if the magnitude of the benefit is clinically significant. The two techniques do not differ significantly in terms of post-operative blood loss or return to full activity. This benefit can be achieved at a net cost of $185 per procedure."</P>
<P>Our finding that there appears to be a greater risk of secondary bleeding with coblation is consistent with other studies. A large, population-based study, the National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit conducted in England and Northern Ireland, found that the adjusted odds of any bleeding were 3.1 times higher (95% CI 2.0 to 4.7) for coblation compared to cold steel with ties/packs and the adjusted odds for bleeding requiring a return to the operating room were 2.8 times higher (95% CI 1.6 to 5.2) for coblation compared to cold steel with ties/packs (<LINK REF="REF-BAO_x002d_HNS_x002f_RCSENG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAO-HNS/RCSENG 2005</LINK>). A second large, population-based study, the National Tonsil Surgery Registry conducted in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f6_derman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Söderman 2015</LINK>), found that all hot techniques conferred a greater risk of secondary haemorrhage compared to cold techniques. Compared to cold dissection and cold haemostasis, the risk of secondary haemorrhage was 2.8 times higher after cold dissection with hot haemostasis, 3.2 times higher after coblation, 4.3 times higher after diathermy scissors and 5.6 times higher after harmonic scalpel. A third study, a systematic review, found that the odds of secondary bleeding were 34 times higher (95% CrI [credible interval] 1.25 to 5676) for coblation compared to cold steel with packs/ties and the odds of secondary bleeding requiring a return to the operating room were four times higher (95% CrI 1.29 to 12.12) for coblation compared to cold steel with ties/packs (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the lack of a meaningful clinical difference in pain, the repeated observation of a higher risk of secondary bleeding requiring return to surgery, which has been documented in multiple reviews, and the increased cost associated with the device, at this time there seems to be no benefit to coblation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 09:41:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Based upon a relatively large number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing coblation tonsillectomy with more conventional methods, there seems to be no benefit to coblation. However, this conclusion is uncertain due to very poor methodology and data reporting in most studies. Whilst this doubt does exist, previously published, high-quality data indicate that coblation tonsillectomy is associated with a clinically significant greater risk of postoperative bleeding requiring return to the operating room. As a result, we suggest that coblation tonsillectomy should be confined to well-designed and adequately executed RCTs in which postoperative bleeding rates are rigorously monitored and consistently reported in a manner that permits subsequent meta-analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-26 11:48:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence for all of the outcomes in this review was <I>low</I> or <I>very low</I>.</P>
<P>The sizes of the included studies were too small and they lacked statistical power to reach conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of coblation tonsillectomy. Meta-analysis is a crucial technique that allows data from multiple studies to be synthesised with improved statistical power. However, data in the included studies were not consistently collected or reported in a way that allowed meta-analysis of all published data.</P>
<P>The nature of surgical studies precludes blinding of the surgeon and that risk of bias cannot be mitigated. However, it is essential to reduce other potential sources of bias when possible. The current review demonstrates that outcome measures are the primary limitation in many tonsillectomy trials. Before further trials are planned, it is crucial to determine which outcomes are important and the timing and method by which each outcome should be measured. International efforts to achieve consensus, such as COMET (<A HREF="http://www.comet.org">www.comet.org</A>), may decrease the variability of outcome reporting across studies and enable subsequent meta-analysis. For example, as we demonstrate in this review, there are major limitations in how pain is measured. The specific measurement tool must be valid for i) the patient age group, ii) the condition (acute postoperative pain) and iii) the setting (language and culture).</P>
<P>Research is also needed to guide future trials about which are the most relevant time points to measure pain. For example, should studies average the pain score over a period of time, or pick certain time points that are most relevant to patient outcomes? The measurement of volume of blood loss during the operation and duration of surgery were also not interpretable across studies; future research or an expert consensus is needed to standardise these measurement methods.</P>
<P>In addition to limitations in the outcome measures, many included studies contained heterogeneous populations in terms of age groups, surgical indications, types of procedures (with or without adenoidectomy) and methods of haemostasis. The studies did not stratify patients according to these factors prior to randomisation and after randomisation these factors were not well reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>RCTs remain an appropriate design to assess some aspects of the safety and effectiveness of coblation tonsillectomy. These should be parallel-group RCTs and the unit of randomisation should be the patient, not the tonsil. If the study includes diverse patients, surgical indications, procedures or methods of haemostasis, stratification should be considered. The patients, outcome assessors and clinicians caring for patients after surgery should not be aware of the treatment group. The surgical team cannot be blinded to the treatment, but treatment in both groups should be performed by teams with similar experience and expertise in the techniques investigated. Consistent use of validated age-appropriate pain scales will reduce risk of bias and heterogeneity, and facilitate comparisons among studies.</P>
<P>Patients should be followed up for at least 14 days, and perhaps longer, as secondary haemorrhage does occur beyond 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Hultcrantz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultcrantz 2013</LINK>). Primary and secondary haemorrhage are very rare events, therefore RCTs cannot estimate the true rate of these complications. A prospective audit or registry of all patients undergoing tonsillectomy would evaluate a greater number of patients and thus better estimate the true complication rate. Therefore, if the primary objective is to study the risk of bleeding after tonsillectomy, an RCT is an inappropriate study design and a prospective audit or registry study should be planned instead.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Population</HEADING>
<P>The population to be studied should be adults and children undergoing tonsillectomy. However, studies should limit the population to either adults or children and should also limit the study according to how much tissue removal is planned (tonsillectomy only or tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy). Alternatively, studies may stratify patients prior to randomisation so that these factors may be assessed in predefined subgroups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention and comparison</HEADING>
<P>The intervention is coblation tonsillectomy using the Coblator II (or later) system, performed by a surgeon with coblation experience.</P>
<P>Future RCTs of coblation tonsillectomy should design the comparator group to utilise only <B>one </B>of the common tonsillectomy techniques in a clearly described and consistent fashion. Comparison techniques might include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>'Cold steel' dissection tonsillectomy with ties/packs to secure haemostasis. Consideration may be given to allowing the use of limited, 'point' diathermy for haemostasis, particularly if this were also allowed in the intervention arm of the trial. This use of diathermy should be clearly documented to allow for subsequent meta-analysis of this as a distinct surgical technique.</LI>
<LI>Monopolar diathermy tonsillectomy.</LI>
<LI>Bipolar diathermy tonsillectomy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For both the intervention and comparison group, use of additional methods, especially haemostasis methods, should be prespecified in the trial protocol. The trial protocol should be very specific about the techniques used and include the criteria for when other methods are allowed. The use of any additional techniques should be clearly reported in the trial report.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Essential outcome measures that should be measured include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Pain assessed using a pain scale validated in the relevant age group and condition (a visual analogue scale should not be used to assess pain in young children).</LI>
<LI>Time to return to normal diet.</LI>
<LI>Time to return to normal activity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Cultural differences may have an impact on patients' experience and reporting of return to 'normal' diet and activity and this should be defined in the protocol for future studies. Some of the heterogeneity we observed may be minimised if future RCTs use standardised patient education and data collection methods for these outcome measures. Since patient compliance with self-reported outcomes is often poor, researchers must anticipate poor follow-up and must design their studies to minimise this. Researchers should consider using investigator-initiated telephone follow-up to collect these data.</P>
<P>Additional outcome measures that may be of interest, but which must be systematically measured and reported using a validated method and continuous measure, include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Duration of surgery.</LI>
<LI>Perioperative blood loss.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is important that research or consensus to establish validated ways of measuring these outcomes are conducted first, before new RCTs are conducted. Future trials will otherwise also be limited by the lack of use of validated measures.</P>
<P>All future RCTs should be reported using the CONSORT guidelines to prevent the difficulties we experienced in extracting the necessary trial data from trialists and trial publications (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>We revised the protocol for this update; the primary changes are in the choice of outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>We revised the inclusion criteria to include studies that performed concurrent adenoidectomy or ear tube insertion.</LI>
<LI>We removed the primary outcome postoperative analgesia and the secondary outcome length of hospital stay. Based on prior experience these outcomes are heavily influenced by institutional protocols and cultural norms and they are inconsistently reported.</LI>
<LI>We preserved the requirement that pain is measured with a validated pain scale and we have specified postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 as relevant time points for pain measurement. Based on the authors' clinical experience, these are clinically relevant time points that have the additional benefit of being commonly reported across studies, lending themselves to meta-analysis. Postoperative day 1 was not in the initial protocol due to concerns that it would be heavily influenced by the anaesthetic regimen, an unmeasured confounding variable. However, since these are randomised trials relative pain severity can still be reliably measured and we thought pain at this very early time point was clinically relevant.</LI>
<LI>We report blood loss as separate outcomes of 'intraoperative blood loss', 'primary blood loss' and 'secondary blood loss' to account for the different nature and timing of the blood losses.</LI>
<LI>We classified comparator tonsillectomy procedures into 'hot' and 'cold' tonsillectomy techniques, based on the instrument used for the tonsillectomy, acknowledging that additional techniques may used for haemostasis.</LI>
<LI>We added details of planned subgroup analyses.</LI>
