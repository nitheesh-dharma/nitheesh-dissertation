<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-27 17:59:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Can giving antibiotics in pregnancy to women who have a urinary infection but no symptoms improve the outcomes for women and their babies?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>A bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection (asymptomatic bacteriuria) occurs in a small number (2% to 10%) of pregnancies. Because of the changes happening in their body, pregnant women are more likely to develop a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) if they have a urinary infection, and the infection may also possibly contribute to having a low birthweight baby or preterm birth (before 37 weeks).</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>The review of trials on antibiotic treatment for women with no symptoms but bacterial infection in their urine found 14 randomized controlled studies involving almost 2000 women. Antibioitcs were effective in reducing the incidence of kidney infection in the mother (11 studies, 1932 women) and clearing the infection from the urine (four studies, 596 women). The incidence of low birthweight babies (six studies, 1437 babies) and preterm births (two studies, 242 women) seemed also to be reduced. None of the studies adequately assessed any adverse effects of antibiotic treatment for the mother or her baby and often the way the study was done was not well described. The three main outcomes were assessed with GRADE and the evidence to support antibiotic treatment to prevent pyelonephritis, preterm birth and birthweight less than 2500 g was judged to be of low to very low quality.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic treatment can reduce the risk of kidney infections in pregnant women who have a urine infection but show no symptoms of infection. Antibiotics may also reduce the chance a baby will be born too early or have a low birthweight. However, the low quality of the evidence makes it hard to know for certain what the effect of treatment will be and more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 17:59:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Fourteen studies, involving almost 2000 women, were included. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment reduced the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 11 studies, 1932 women; <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; six studies, 1437 babies; <I>low quality evidence</I>) and preterm birth (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; two studies, 242 women; <I>low quality evidence</I>). A reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery was seen (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; four studies; 596 women). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes and maternal adverse effects were rarely described.</P>
<P>Overall, all 14 studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias. While many studies lacked an adequate description of methods and the risk of bias could only be assessed as unclear, in almost all studies there was at least one domain where the risk of bias was judged as high. The three primary outcomes were assessed with GRADE software and given a quality rating. Evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth and birthweight less than 2500 g was assessed as of low or very low quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-06 15:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, the estimate of the effect is very uncertain because of the very low quality of the evidence. The reduction in low birthweight and preterm birth with antibiotic treatment is consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this association should be interpreted with caution given the very poor quality of the included studies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-06 20:05:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Asymptomatic bacteriuria, generally defined as true bacteriuria in the absence of specific symptoms of acute urinary tract infection, is a common finding and occurs in 2% to 10% of all pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Whalley-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whalley 1967</LINK>). Rates from more recent studies generally fall within this range (<LINK REF="REF-Bandyopadhyay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandyopadhyay 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Celen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fatima-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatima 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIsaac-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIsaac 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohammad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammad 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tugrul-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugrul 2005</LINK>), although in observational studies from some developing countries higher rates are reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ajayi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajayi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizvi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizvi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tadesse-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tadesse 2014</LINK>). The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was reported to be as high as 86.6% in a population from Nigeria that included <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, a possible contaminant, as a uropathogen (<LINK REF="REF-Akerele-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akerele 2001</LINK>). Rates were reported to be higher in HIV positive women in Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Awolude-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awolude 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ezechi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezechi 2013</LINK>), but not in a study from South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Widmer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widmer 2010</LINK>). In a large retrospective study, the strongest predictor of bacteriuria was an antepartum urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pastore-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pastore 1999</LINK>). A study from an electronics factory in China found an association between urinary tract infections in pregnancy and frequency of voiding, with voiding three or more times a shift being protective (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2009</LINK>), and in a study from Iran, there was an association between infection and frequency of sexual intercourse and genital hygiene practices (<LINK REF="REF-Amiri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiri 2009</LINK>). The prevalence of infection is related to socioeconomic status (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turck-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turck 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whalley-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whalley 1967</LINK>), although this may not always apply (<LINK REF="REF-Awoleke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awoleke 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovavisarach-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovavisarach 2009</LINK>). Other contributing factors recognized as associated with an increased risk for bacteriuria include diabetes and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract.</P>
<P>The original criterion for diagnosing asymptomatic bacteriuria was more than 100,000 bacteria/mL on two consecutive clean-catch samples (<LINK REF="REF-Kass-1960a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 1960a</LINK>). The detection of more than 100,000 bacterial/mL in a single voided midstream urine is accepted as an adequate and more practical alternative, although there is only an 80% probability the woman has true bacteriuria, increasing to 95% if two or more consecutive cultures are positive for the same organism (<LINK REF="REF-Kass-1960a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 1960a</LINK>). Because the performance of rapid urine screening tests in pregnancy is poor, quantitative culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bachman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garingalo_x002d_Molina-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garingalo-Molina 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mignini-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mignini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tincello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tincello 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>E. coli</I> is the most common pathogen associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria, representing up to 80% of isolates. Other organisms include other gram negative bacteria, e.g. <I>Klebsiella</I> spp. and <I>Proteus mirabilis</I>, and group B streptococci. These bacteria colonize the vaginal introitus and periurethral area. Uropathogenic gram negative bacteria possess specific virulence factors that enhance both colonization and invasion of the urinary tract, for example, the P-fimbriae of certain strains of <I>E. coli</I> that allow for adherence to uroepithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenstein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenqvist-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenqvist 1987</LINK>). Some strains of <I>E.coli </I>isolated from pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria have a similar virulence pattern to strains from women with symptomatic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2011</LINK>), but this does not always hold true (<LINK REF="REF-Stenqvist-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenqvist 1987</LINK>). While <I>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</I> is recognized as a urinary pathogen, other species of <I>Staphylococci</I> including <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> may reflect contamination rather than a true infection and prevalence data where the number of <I>Staphylococcus</I> spp. is high are difficult to interpret. Maternal urinary tract infection with group B streptococci is associated with vaginal colonization with the organism and antibiotic treatment during labor is recommended to prevent early onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>While asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-pregnant women is generally benign (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolle 2014</LINK>), obstruction to the flow of urine in pregnancy leads to stasis and increases the likelihood that pyelonephritis will complicate asymptomatic bacteriuria. If asymptomatic bacteriuria is untreated, up to 30% of mothers develop acute pyelonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Whalley-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whalley 1967</LINK>). Mechanical compression from the enlarging uterus is the principal cause of hydroureter and hydronephrosis, but smooth muscle relaxation induced by progesterone may also play a role (<LINK REF="REF-Sobel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobel 1995</LINK>). Differences in urine pH and osmolality and pregnancy-induced glycosuria and aminoaciduria may facilitate bacterial growth. Clinical signs of pyelonephritis include fever, chills, costo-vertebral tenderness, dysuria and frequency. Nausea and vomiting are common and if infection is associated with bacteremia, women may present with high fever, shaking chills and low blood pressure. Maternal complications include maternal respiratory insufficiency, septicemia, renal dysfunction and anemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2014</LINK>) and in the pre-antibiotic era, acute pyelonephritis was associated with a 20% to 50% incidence of preterm birth. From an 18-year retrospective review in an era of routine screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, the incidence of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy was 0.5% and was associated with preterm birth (odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 to 1.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2014</LINK>); women with pyelonephritis were more likely to be black or Hispanic, young, less educated, initiate prenatal care late and smoke. Similar findings of an association between acute pyelonephritis and preterm birth were described in a study from Israel (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.9) (<LINK REF="REF-Farkash-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farkash 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the earliest studies of Kass, an association between asymptomatic bacteriuria and low birthweight and preterm birth has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Kass-1960a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 1960a</LINK>), but population-based studies have produced conflicting results. A retrospective study from Israel that controlled for confounders showed an association between asymptomatic bacteriuria and preterm birth (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiner 2009</LINK>) but, in contrast, findings from the Cardiff Birth Survey reported that asymptomatic bacteriuria, adjusted for demographic and social factors, was not associated with preterm birth (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Meis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 1995</LINK>). However, when preterm births were categorized into those indicated for medical complications of pregnancy (e.g. antepartum hemorrhage, eclampsia or renal disease) or spontaneous preterm births, there was a significant association between bacteriuria and medically indicated preterm births (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.8) but not for spontaneous preterm births (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.46) (<LINK REF="REF-Meis-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 1995a</LINK>) and the authors concluded that if asymptomatic bacteruria does not progress to pyelonephritis, it is not associated with preterm birth.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-27 10:26:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The goal of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria is to treat and clear the infection. The urinary bacterial isolate should be susceptible to the antibiotic chosen, the length of treatment adequate, adherence assured and the drug have favorable pharmacokinetic parameters. The treatment should be safe in pregnancy and for the developing fetus. Many different antibiotic regimens have been used to treat bacteriuria but not all the antibiotics previously evaluated are currently available. Increasing bacterial resistance of urinary pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Assefa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assefa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enayat-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enayat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hernandez-Blas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernandez Blas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizvi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizvi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tadesse-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tadesse 2014</LINK>) can make it difficult to select an appropriate regimen, especially in under-resourced settings where facilities for urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are limited. There is no evidence that non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. cranberry juice, are effective (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2008</LINK>), although no data exist to suggest the use of cranberry has any harmful effects on pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Heitmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heitmann 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-26 11:54:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Urinary pathogens causing asymptomatic bacteriuria are similar to those causing pyelonephritis and antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, with eradication of the infection, is expected to prevent ascending urinary tract infection and the development of clinical pyelonephritis.</P>
<P>The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria, low birthweight and preterm birth is controversial and a mechanism for an association between preterm labor and asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been established. Microbial-induced preterm labor is mediated by an inflammatory process (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 2014</LINK>). Microorganisms and their products are sensed by pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), which induce the production of chemokines, prostaglandins, and proteases leading to the onset of labor. While this mechanism has been well defined for ascending intra-amniotic infection, there has been no recent research to explore the mechanisms through which asymptomatic bacteriuria might exert adverse pregnancy outcomes.<BR/>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-05 22:24:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy has become a standard of obstetric care and most antenatal guidelines include routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Using a decision analysis, screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis has been shown to be cost-effective over a wide range of estimates, although the cost-benefit is diminished if the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria is less than 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Rouse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadland 1989</LINK>). The low prevalence of infection in certain populations, the cost of different screening tests, and uncertainty about the benefits of treatment in decreasing adverse outcomes of pregnancy have, however, been used to argue against screening and treatment as universal recommendations, and preventing unnecessary antibiotic use has become an important aspect of programs to decrease the development of antimicrobial resistance. A rigorous evaluation of studies of the effect of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria could provide clarity around these issues.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using GRADE</HEADING>
<P>For this update, the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes, for the main comparison of antibiotic versus no treatment.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Development of pyelonephritis</LI>
<LI>Preterm birth less than 37 weeks</LI>
<LI>Birthweight less than 2500 g</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>We planned to include cluster-randomized trials in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials, if any were identified. In future updates of this review, if any cluster-randomized trials are included, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either a Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we explored it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 18:04:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. The description of the characteristics of the study groups was poor. In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1987</LINK>), were the similarities in age, parity and socioeconomic status between the treatment and no treatment groups adequately described; in the study from <LINK REF="REF-Kass-1960a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 1960a</LINK>, the racial distribution of the two groups was described and was comparable; in four other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulla-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Mulla 1960</LINK>), the urinary bacterial isolates for the two groups were listed, but otherwise there was no attempt to demonstrate the comparability of the study groups. No study included the rates of maternal smoking, a recognized risk for low birthweight. There was no description of the presence of co-existing genital infections, although one study excluded women with positive serology for syphilis (<LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1969</LINK>). Details on the management of recurrent urinary tract infection or persistent infection, the treatment of symptomatic lower urinary tract infection (cystitis) and concurrent antibiotic administration were incomplete. Some studies included twin deliveries while other studies excluded these.<BR/>
<BR/>There was no consistent application of standard definitions for the measured outcomes. Pyelonephritis usually referred to symptoms of loin pain, fever, dysuria or frequency, with or without a significant urine culture. While rates of low birthweight were usually reported, most studies described this as "prematurity". For those studies that reported rates of preterm births, the definition of preterm birth was inconsistent, and there were insufficient data presented in any of the studies to compare gestational ages between treatment and control groups.</P>

For most studies, however, a substantial benefit effect was seen with treatment; one study with anomalous results (<LINK REF="STD-Furness-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Furness 1975</LINK>) was responsible for most of the heterogeneity seen for the outcome of pyelonephritis.</P>
<P>There was evidence of a reduction in preterm birth (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; participants = 242; studies = two; I = 10%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) when this was defined as a gestational age of less than 37 weeks. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wren-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Wren 1969</LINK>) reported this outcome; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1987</LINK> only enrolled women with group B streptococcal bacteriuria. A reduction in the incidence of birthweight less than 2500 g was seen with treatment (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; participants = 1437; studies = six; I = 28%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

Without treatment, asymptomatic bacteriuria persisted in 70% of women. Although there was significant statistical heterogeneity among trials, likely explained by differences in study design and intervention, the direction of the effect was consistent.

<P>There was a reduction in the incidence of pyelonephritis for all subgroups regardless of duration of treatment and by inspection of the graphs there was no evidence of a clinically important difference by duration of treatment.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-06 20:05:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>While the results of these studies are consistent, yielding reductions in the incidence of pyelonephritis, low birthweight and preterm birth with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, important methodological considerations limit the strength of the conclusions. There was significant heterogeneity observed among the studies, which may be explained by study design or quality, type of antibiotic used and the long time interval over which the trials were performed.. Duration of antibiotic treatment did not appear to explain any heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The overall incidence of pyelonephritis in the untreated group was 21%, but ranged from 2.5% to 36%. While different definitions of pyelonephritis could explain some of this variation, there may be other factors, for example, type of organism, socioeconomic status, other care given in pregnancy, that, if defined, could identify groups of women with asymptomatic bacteriuria with different risks of developing pyelonephritis. In the absence of this type of information, however, the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria itself defines a population at risk of pyelonephritis. Overall, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria will lead to approximately a 75% reduction in the incidence of pyelonephritis.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 18:06:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The studies reported here (with only three exceptions) date from the 1960s and 1970s; microbiological methodology for the diagnosis of bacteriuria has not significantly changed over this interval. Although not all of the antibiotics used in these studies remain available currently, and the use of tetracycline is now contraindicated in pregnancy, it is valid to assume that the results are applicable to other antibiotics active against urinary pathogens that are safe in pregnancy. A Cochrane review of treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy concluded that although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Vazquez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez 2011</LINK>), and there were similar conclusions for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-Guinto-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinto 2010</LINK>). The choice of a sulfonamide or sulfonamide-containing combination, a penicillin, cephalosporin, fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin, based on the results of susceptibility testing, are appropriate regimens for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Increasing antibiotic resistance, however, complicates the choice of empiric regimens and can make it difficult to select an appropriate regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Assefa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assefa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enayat-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enayat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hernandez-Blas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernandez Blas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tadesse-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tadesse 2014</LINK>), and a recent report from India described the presence of extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBL) in 47% of isolates of <I>E. coli</I> and 36.9% of isolates of <I>Klebsiella pneumoniae</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Rizvi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizvi 2011</LINK>). Results from surveys of antibiotic susceptibility in pathogens causing community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections demonstrate considerable regional variation: resistance to ampicillin in <I>E. coli</I> in a survey of European countries and Canada averaged 29.8% but was as high as 53.9% in Spain (<LINK REF="REF-Kahlmeter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahlmeter 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was an association between treatment and preterm birth, but only two studies reported this outcome, one of which only included women with group B streptococcus bacteriuria, and the other was very poor methodologically. Although we chose to combine data from the two studies, given the very different populations and interventions, the effect of treatment on preterm birth is very uncertain. While preterm births are associated with low birthweight, some low birthweight infants are small-for-gestational age as a consequence of intrauterine growth retardation, for which there are many possible etiologies. The reduction in the incidence of low birthweight with antibiotic treatment is, however, consistent with current theories about the role of infection as a cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but a greater understanding of the basic mechanisms by which the treatment of bacteriuria could lead to a reduction in low birthweight is required. Prevention of pyelonephritis, which in early studies prior to the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy was associated with preterm birth, may be a factor, but treatment of bacteriuria with antibiotics may also eradicate organisms colonizing the cervix and vagina that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The relationship between genital infections such as bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor was not recognized when these studies on the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria were originally designed.</P>

<P>Many of the studies only contributed data to one or two of the outcomes; for most of the outcomes, data are missing. Most studies did include the outcome of pyelonephritis, but when these studies were being designed there was already an awareness of a possible association between asymptomatic bacteriuria and low birthweight and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Kass-1960a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 1960a</LINK>). There was no explanation why these outcomes were not systematically collected and reported in most of the trials, and these missing data did contribute to the overall low quality of most of the studies. In none of the studies reviewed were the adverse effects of antibiotics systematically collected. The incidence of allergic reactions, vaginal yeast infections, gastrointestinal side effects and the development of bacterial resistance, were not considered, nor were neonatal outcomes systematically collected. While it is not possible to compare the benefits versus the disadvantages of antibiotic therapy from these studies, it is unlikely that the expected side effects from a short course of antibiotics would be significant although increasingly there are concerns about the effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome and the immune system.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-27 18:06:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is indicated to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. A prospective longitudinal study over a two-year period from 2000 to 2001 reported an incidence of hospitalization for acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy of 1.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2005</LINK>), and a recent 18-year retrospective study reported that the incidence of acute pyelonephritis was 0.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2014</LINK>), both less than the 3% to 4% rate reported in the early 1970s before screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria became routine.</P>
<P>The optimal time to perform the urine culture is unknown; it seems reasonable to perform the urine culture and treat, as done in these studies, at the first prenatal visit but a single culture before 20 weeks may miss more than half of women with asymptomatic bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-McIsaac-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIsaac 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven of the studies continued antibiotics until term; one additional study treated women for six weeks, while the majority of the rest gave treatment for three to seven days. Both continuous treatment and short-course therapy strategies show a benefit in the reduction of pyelonephritis. A small randomized study that compared intermittent therapy with continuous treatment confirmed that both strategies were equally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Whalley-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whalley 1977</LINK>). While short-course therapy of asymptomatic bacteriuria has become accepted practice, the optimal duration of treatment is unknown but a three to seven day treatment regimen is currently recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Widmer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widmer 2011</LINK>). The choice of antibiotic for treatment should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. While it is unlikely that the appropriate use of antibiotics to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is an important factor in increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics, it has made the selection of an antibiotic for an individual woman much more difficult.</P>
<P>In the studies included in this review, insufficient data were presented to determine the effectiveness of treatment to prevent recurrent bacteriuria during the pregnancy. Although it is recommended that a urine culture be done following treatment, with re-treatment as necessary, the studies did not specifically evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy, and the results of a systematic review concluded there was no optimal intervention to prevent recurrent infection (<LINK REF="REF-Schneeberger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneeberger 2012</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-27 18:07:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review has identified several areas where there are implications for research:</P>
<P>
<B>Incorporating risk factors for pyelonephritis in a screening algorithm</B> </P>
<P>In an era when routine prenatal screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria has been standard, women with pyelonephritis were more likely to be black or Hispanic, young, less educated, nulliparous, initiate prenatal care late, and smoke during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2014</LINK>). However, while some of these factors and other risk factors that are associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria may be amenable to interventions or used to identify women at greater risk of an adverse outcome, there has been no evaluation of a screening algorithm incorporating risk factors.</P>
<P>
<B>Understanding the pathogenesis of infection</B>
</P>
<P>A better understanding of the basic mechanisms by which treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria could prevent low birthweight is required. Any study of the relationship between other infections and adverse outcomes of pregnancy needs to control for asymptomatic bacteriuria and its treatment but it is unlikely that the particular contribution of asymptomatic bacteriuria to preterm birth and low birthweight will ever be conclusively determined.</P>
<P>
<B>The significance of lower colony counts and different urinary pathogens</B>
</P>
<P>The studies included in this review generally used a urine colony count of more than 100,000 bacteria/mL to identify patients. Although lower colony counts have been shown to be associated with active infection in other populations (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1982</LINK>), their significance in pregnancy has not been established. Treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with lower colony counts is not currently recommended, but further study of appropriate strategies to manage these women is warranted. <I>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</I> is a recognized cause of symptomatic infection in non-pregnant women; however, the importance of this organism in asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established. While <I>E. coli </I>remains the predominant organism in most studies, the increasing prevalence of <I>Proteus mirabilis</I> and other <I>Enterobacteriaceae</I> along with other <I>Staphylococcus spp.</I> suggests different variables may be influencing the epidemiology of bacteriuria in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolle 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Urine screening tests: methods, timing and frequency</B>
</P>
<P>Quantitative urine culture of a midstream or clean-catch urine is the gold standard for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but this test is expensive and may not always be available in all clinical settings. Although rapid urine screening tests, for example, urine microscopy and urine dipstick, have not been shown to perform satisfactorily in this population, their use may be cost-beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Rouse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 1995</LINK>). Any new urine screening test that is developed needs to be evaluated in the context of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy.</P>
<P>None of these studies adequately addressed when the most appropriate time is to perform the initial screening culture, how often to repeat a negative culture and how best to monitor women initially treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria. There is a need to define the appropriate frequency of follow-up cultures and re-treatment strategies.</P>
<P>
<B>Adherence to guidelines</B>
</P>
<P>Despite almost uniform national guidelines, there is little evidence of adherence to screening recommendations. In Australia, poor adherence with screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in indigenous communities has been proposed as one explanation for worse pregnancy outcomes in this population; a structural problem related to provision of care in remote communities was identified as the cause (<LINK REF="REF-Bookallil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bookallil 2005</LINK>). Screening rates from 1% to 96% were reported in a pilot survey of quality indicators of antenatal care in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Vause-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vause 1999</LINK>). There is an opportunity to evaluate screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria as a measure of quality of care and gain a better understanding of the implementation of screening policies for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the developing world.</P>
<P>
<B>Cost-effectiveness</B>
</P>
<P>While there are no new data to indicate that women should not be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, it is difficult to estimate accurately the cost-effectiveness of screening without up-to-date information on the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and a more accurate estimate of the reduction in pyelonephritis, low birthweight and preterm births with treatment. A Health Technology Assessment report from the UK on screening to prevent preterm birth estimated that antibiotic treatment for all women without any testing was the most cost-effective option for preventing birth before 37 weeks; however, they did not take into account the side effects of antibiotics or issues such as resistance, and the conclusions were based on the low-quality data associating treatment with a reduction in preterm births (<LINK REF="REF-Honest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2009</LINK>). There needs to be prospective evaluation of cost-effective diagnostic algorithms, that include risk factors and up-to-date outcomes, in different populations.</P>
<P>
<B>Research in low-risk populations</B>
</P>
<P>Despite the demonstrated association between antibiotic treatment and the prevention of pyelonephritis, there is an opportunity for research to provide better quality data to inform the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria. In a low-risk population, a carefully designed randomized, placebo-controlled trial with close monitoring of outcomes, including the adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy, could be performed and provide useful information on alternative management strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Kazemier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kazemier 2012</LINK>). Preventing inappropriate antibiotic use has become an important aspect of programs to decrease the development of antimicrobial resistance and this concern gives an impetus to researchers to identify a population of women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in whom antibiotic treatment may not be necessary.</P>
