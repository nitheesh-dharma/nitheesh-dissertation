<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-22 09:46:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is common and often results in permanent hearing loss. It therefore has a high impact on the well-being of those affected. Tinnitus (abnormal persistent noises or ringing in the ear) is similarly common and often accompanies the hearing loss. Although the cause of these complaints is not clear, they may be related to a lack of oxygen secondary to a vascular problem not yet identified. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing pure oxygen in a specially designed chamber and it is sometimes used as a treatment to increase the supply of oxygen to the ear and brain in an attempt to reduce the severity of hearing loss and tinnitus.</P>
<P>We found some evidence from seven small trials of generally poor quality, that hearing may be improved in people with ISSHL and possibly that tinnitus may also be improved. This may only be true if HBOT is used within two weeks of the onset of problems and there is no evidence that HBOT can help people who have been deaf for some months. Further research is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-18 10:15:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Seven trials contributed to this review (392 participants). The studies were small and of generally poor quality. Pooled data from two trials did not show any significant improvement in the chance of a 50% increase in hearing threshold on pure-tone average with HBOT (risk ratio (RR) with HBOT 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 2.78, P = 0.16), but did show a significantly increased chance of a 25% increase in pure-tone average (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.84, P = 0.02). There was a 22% greater chance of improvement with HBOT, and the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve one extra good outcome was 5 (95% CI 3 to 20). There was also an absolute improvement in average pure-tone audiometric threshold following HBOT (mean difference (MD) 15.6 dB greater with HBOT, 95% CI 1.5 to 29.8, P = 0.03). The significance of any improvement in tinnitus could not be assessed.</P>
<P>There were no significant improvements in hearing or tinnitus reported for chronic presentation (six months) of ISSHL and/or tinnitus.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-10 12:31:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For people with acute ISSHL, the application of HBOT significantly improved hearing, but the clinical significance remains unclear. We could not assess the effect of HBOT on tinnitus by pooled analysis. In view of the modest number of patients, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting, this result should be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial is justified to define those patients (if any) who can be expected to derive most benefit from HBOT.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of a beneficial effect of HBOT on chronic ISSHL or tinnitus and we do not recommend the use of HBOT for this purpose.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-10 12:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 1, 2005 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-10 12:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is an acute hearing impairment, with an incidence of about 8 to 15 per 100,000 of the population per year (<LINK REF="REF-Stokroos-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokroos 1996a</LINK>). Although the aetiology and pathophysiology remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Haberkamp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haberkamp 1999</LINK>), ISSHL is most commonly defined as a greater than 30 dB sensorineural hearing loss occurring in at least three contiguous audiometric frequencies over 72 hours or less (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1996</LINK>). Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation, and in many cases it is associated with some degree of hearing loss, particularly in those individuals who have been exposed to excessive noise. The incidence is probably around 10% to 20% of adults in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-ATA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coles 1990</LINK>). For the patient it may be trivial or it may become a debilitating illness (<LINK REF="REF-Luxon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luxon 1993</LINK>). Sufferers from tinnitus hear a noise that apparently arises from the ears or within the head and may be continuous or intermittent. Brief episodes of tinnitus are probably normal, and clinically significant tinnitus is usually defined by applying one of several classification systems proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Dauman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The onset of ISSHL is abrupt in many patients, therefore a vascular cause has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Belal-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belal 1980</LINK>) but other possibilities include viral infection, autoimmune disease and inner ear membrane rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Thurmond-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurmond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 1990</LINK>). The cause of tinnitus is equally obscure, although it is often associated with ISSHL - up to 90% of patients suffering with ISSHL also complain of tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Parnes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnes 1997</LINK>). The most widely discussed theories include excessive or abnormal spontaneous activity in the auditory system and in related cerebral areas (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenbach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenbach 2000</LINK>) and abnormal processing of a signal generated in the auditory system with 'feedback' (<LINK REF="REF-Jastreboff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jastreboff 1990</LINK>). Recent work confirms that a broad multimodal network of neurons, often operating from a site remote to that of the initial pathology, is involved in generating and sustaining the tinnitus perception in some forms of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Cacace-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cacace 2003</LINK>). Tinnitus has, in fact, been compared to chronic pain of central origin in some regards, and when symptoms are severe, tinnitus can be associated with major depression, anxiety and other psychological disturbances, leading to a progressive deterioration of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatments for ISSHL have mostly been designed to improve the blood circulation and oxygenation of the inner ear and include vasodilators, plasma expanders, steroids, anticoagulants, diuretics, contrast dye and antivirals. None have been proven of benefit in large randomised trials or meta-analyses. A recent Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of vasodilators for ISSHL (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2009</LINK>). Assessment of the effectiveness of therapy is further complicated by a high rate of spontaneous recovery, as much as 65% in some studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mattox-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattox 1977</LINK>), and the very variable periods for which hearing loss has been present before the institution of therapy. While the impact of therapy will vary with individual circumstances, we have selected a 50% return of hearing following therapy as a clinically significant improvement when considering appropriate power for included studies in this review. Specific therapies for tinnitus have tended to focus on the impact of the noise on quality of life and mood, and include antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines, or on trying to mask the noise itself with white noise generators. A variety of psychotherapeutic and 'habituation' programmes are also advocated to help the sufferer deal with the problem (<LINK REF="REF-Noell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noell 2003</LINK>). A Cochrane Review of antidepressants for tinnitus has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Baldo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldo 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 07:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a further, usually adjunctive, therapy that has been proposed to improve both ISSHL and tinnitus. This is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than one atmosphere absolute (ATA). Administration involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 3.0 ATA for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or twice daily. A typical course will involve 20 to 40 such treatments.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 07:14:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was first reported to improve the outcome following ISSHL and tinnitus in the late 1960s by both French and German workers (translations unavailable at present). The administration of hyperbaric oxygen is based on the argument that both hearing loss and tinnitus may result from an hypoxic event in the cochlear apparatus, and that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be able to reverse that oxygen deficit (<LINK REF="STD-Lamm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lamm 1998</LINK>). Despite more than 30 years of interest in the delivery of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in these patients, however, little clinical evidence exists for the assertion that such an intervention improves outcome.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-17 07:14:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, hyperbaric oxygen therapy cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-07-10 13:03:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To assess the evidence for the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of both acute and chronic sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus.</P>
<P>We compared treatment regimens including hyperbaric oxygen against similar regimens excluding hyperbaric oxygen. Where regimens differed significantly between studies, we clearly stated this and discussed the implications. We made all comparisons using an intention-to-treat analysis where possible and they reflect efficacy in the context of randomised trials rather than true effectiveness in any particular clinical context. Specifically, we wished to address the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does the administration of hyperbaric oxygen to people with idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss (whether early or late presentation) result in an increase in the proportion attaining a useful improvement in hearing? We also intended to investigate both binaural hearing recovery and speech discrimination recovery where possible.</LI>
<LI>Does the administration of hyperbaric oxygen to people with tinnitus (whether early or late presentation) result in an increase in the proportion experiencing a useful reduction in tinnitus?</LI>

Three authors (MB, TK and PY) examined the electronic search results and identified studies that may have been relevant and these studies were entered into a bibliographic software package (Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>)) when any of the authors considered the study might satisfy the inclusion criteria. At the 2009 update, a fourth author was added who was able to translate and appraise articles in German (MP). We retrieved all comparative clinical trials identified by this process with the assistance of the Cochrane Advanced Reviewer Support Service of the Australasian Cochrane Centre and the three authors reviewed them independently, two with content expertise in sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, one with content expertise in hyperbaric oxygen. In addition, two of the authors (MB and MP) have expertise in clinical epidemiology. Authors recorded data using the data extraction form developed for this review.</P>
<P>Where reporting methods differed between trials for the same outcome, we attempted to contact the principal authors to request further data. Our intention was to convert reported data to a form that enabled meta-analysis, however no suitable further data were forthcoming from any author.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-07-10 13:42:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Each author extracted relevant data and agreed on the trial characteristics included in the 'Risk of bias' table. In addition, we ranked studies on sample size and identified those with sufficient power to determine the clinically important effect for which the trial was designed. All data extracted reflected original allocation group where possible to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. We identified drop-outs where this information was given.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>1. There were two approaches to improvement in hearing loss analysis depending on the nature of the data presented:</P>
<P>a) Proportion of participants with good hearing loss resolution (e.g. pure-tone average (PTA) improvement &gt; 20 dB). We dichotomised participants into good outcome and poor outcome. We established the RR for good outcome with hyperbaric oxygen therapy using the intention-to-treat data of the hyperbaric oxygen therapy versus the control group. As an estimate of the statistical significance of a difference between experimental interventions and control interventions we calculated RR for benefit using hyperbaric oxygen therapy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed a statistically significant difference between experimental intervention and control intervention if the 95% CI of the RR did not include the value 1.0. As an estimate of the clinical relevance of any difference between experimental intervention and control intervention we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) with 95% CI as appropriate.</P>
<P>b) Comparison of the difference between the mean change in PTA in each group, hyperbaric oxygen versus non-hyperbaric oxygen. We compared the mean differences (MD) in hearing loss recovery between hyperbaric oxygen and control groups using RevMan 5. We defined a statistically significant difference as existing if the 95% CI did not include a zero MD.</P>
<P>2. Relief of tinnitus was treated similarly to 1) above.</P>

<P>3. Activities of daily living (ADL). The mean differences (MD) in ADL between hyperbaric oxygen and control groups were to be compared as in 1b) above.</P>
<P>4. Depression and mood disturbance. Methods were to depend on the nature of the data as in 1b) above.</P>
<P>5. Adverse events. We considered dichotomous data for adverse events (number of patients with adverse events versus number of patients without them in both groups) in the hyperbaric oxygen groups of the included studies.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 11:05:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>At the initial search, we identified 91 publications apparently dealing with the use of HBOT for the treatment of ISSHL, tinnitus or both. Initial examination confirmed 23 were case reports or case series, 23 were reviews without new data, 12 were dealing with a different condition (acoustic trauma) and 12 were non-random comparative studies. We excluded these reports. At the 2009 update, further information was available for three studies. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Blagovesh-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blagovesh 1990</LINK> were translated and confirmed not to report a randomised comparison of HBOT versus an alternative therapeutic strategy. We excluded these two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK> was translated and accepted into the analysis. After appraisal of the 21 full reports we excluded three further reports as reviews without new data, three as comparative trials where all groups received HBOT, four as non-random comparative trials with historical controls or sequential treatment, and two as case series (see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The other seven trials were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Cavallazzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cavallazzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further search of all resources was repeated in February 2011 and May 2012. We found 121 citations of which seven were possible randomised trials. Two were in planning with no reported data (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 2002</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>), one was an early report of an included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995a</LINK>) and four have been unattainable for full appraisal to date (see <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>). Therefore this update has located no further trials for inclusion. The full study flow diagram is given for all searches combined in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The included trials were published between 1985 and 2004, and the authors are unaware of any ongoing randomised controlled trials in the area. In total, these trials include data on 392 participants, 207 receiving HBOT and 185 control (one participant was lost without information on allocation). The largest (<LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>) accounts for 22% of cases (see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the dose of oxygen per treatment session and for the total course of treatment varied between studies. The lowest dose administered was 1.5 ATA for 45 minutes daily for 15 days (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK>), while the highest dose was 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes daily for 25 days (<LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>). All authors used between 1.5 and 2.5 ATA as a maximum oxygen pressure and the total number of individual treatment sessions varied from 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwab 1998</LINK>) to 25 (<LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>).</P>

All included studies reported at least one clinical outcome of interest. Of the outcomes identified above, these trials reported data on both primary outcomes (pure-tone audiometric documented change in hearing and relief of tinnitus) but none of the secondary outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>Other outcomes (including non-clinical) reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK> included: auditory evoked potentials, videonystagmography, static posturography, neurological examination, doppler echography, magnetic resonance imagery and computed tomography.

There was a statistically significant improvement in those with severe hearing loss at enrolment (14 participants, MD 37.7 dB, 95% CI 22.9 to 52.5, P &lt; 0.0001) and moderate hearing loss (22 participants, MD 19.3, 95% CI 5.2 to 33.4, P = 0.007), but not for mild hearing loss (19 participants, MD 0.2, 95% CI -10.0 to 10.4, P = 0.97).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-12 14:20:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This review has included data from seven trials and we believe these represent all randomised human trials in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of searching the databases. We found limited evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves hearing when applied as an early treatment in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). There was some indication from the analysis of pooled data from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cavallazzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cavallazzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK>) that HBOT increases the proportion of patients gaining more than 25% improvement in hearing, while one of those trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK>) suggested that there was a greater mean improvement in pure-tone average (PTA) as a percentage of baseline following HBOT. Four trials also suggested improvements in mean hearing measured in decibels following HBOT (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>), with some evidence that more severely affected patients will improve most with the application of HBOT. We found no evidence that HBOT was useful in those individuals with long-standing hearing loss or tinnitus of unknown aetiology.</P>
<P>Only seven trials with 392 participants were available for evaluation using our planned comparisons, and meta-analysis was not appropriate or possible for a number of these. Other problems for this review were the poor methodological quality of many of these trials (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>), variability and poor reporting of entry criteria, the variable nature and timing of outcomes, and poor reporting of both outcomes and methodology. In particular, given the high rate of spontaneous recovery from ISSHL, there is a possibility of bias due to different times to entry in these small trials, as well as from non-blinded management decisions in all trials. The conclusions of this review are therefore to be interpreted with great caution.</P>
<P>These trials were published over a 19-year period up to 2004, and are from a wide geographical area. We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to the time between onset and therapy, the putative aetiology of the ISSHL or tinnitus, the dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course) and the nature of the comparative treatment modalities. None of these strategies were appropriate in the small number of pooled analyses. In particular, the <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK> trial, which differed significantly in that these authors admitted only participants who had failed to respond to two weeks of intensive multiple pharmacotherapy, did not contribute to any pooled analysis. Response rates stratified by severity of hearing loss on presentation were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Cavallazzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cavallazzi 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>. Whilst <LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK> suggested a trend to greater treatment effect in those more severely affected, this is not the case for the patients treated by <LINK REF="STD-Cavallazzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cavallazzi 1996</LINK>. We have not subjected any possible trend to formal statistical testing. Patient inclusion criteria were not standard and were poorly reported in some trials. No standard severity scale was employed across these trials, and the time to entry varied from within 48 hours for <LINK REF="STD-Fattori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fattori 2001</LINK> to two weeks for <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schwab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwab 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Topuz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Topuz 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Pooling of data for clinical outcomes of interest could only be performed with respect to the proportion of patients showing an audiometric improvement in hearing of 50% or 25% from baseline to the end of therapy, and the absolute improvement in each group measured in dB. While the chance of a 50% improvement was not significantly increased following HBOT, the chance of a 25% improvement in hearing was (risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.84, P = 0.02). Heterogeneity did not seem to be an issue (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This analysis suggests that we would need to treat five patients with HBOT in order to improve one person's hearing by 25% (NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 20). Given the small number of participants and generally poor quality of these trials, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. Further, the clinical significance of a 25% improvement in hearing from baseline is not clear and will depend greatly on the starting level of impairment. No trial in this review has estimated any functional improvement. With respect to absolute improvements in pure-tone audiometric thresholds, our analysis suggests a greater average improvement with HBOT of 15.6 dB more than control (95% CI 1.5 to 29.8, P = 0.03), and that this improvement may depend on the severity of hearing loss at presentation.</P>
<P>Three trials reported on improvements in tinnitus for patients with an early presentation (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwab 1998</LINK>). While Schwab and Hoffmann both reported improvement in mean visual analogue scores for patients receiving HBOT, neither group of authors reported standard deviations around the mean and the significance of these changes is not clear. Pilgramm reported a non-significant increase in the proportion of patients with improvements in tinnitus following HBOT (RR 1.7, P = 0.31). There was no suggestion that HBOT had a positive influence on chronic presentation of tinnitus in the two trials that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of these trials systematically reported adverse effects with HBOT or control therapies, although <LINK REF="STD-Pilgramm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pilgramm 1985</LINK> did report six participants who were withdrawn from HBOT with either aural barotrauma or confinement anxiety. HBOT is regarded as a relatively benign intervention. There are few major adverse effects (pulmonary barotrauma, drug reactions, injuries or death related to chamber fire). There are a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly. Visual disturbance, usually reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported - perhaps in as many as 50% of those having a course of 30 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). While the great majority of patients recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, a small proportion of patients continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. The second most common adverse effect associated with HBOT is barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Aural barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and usually requires active effort by the patient in order to inflate the middle ear through the Eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly, but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Most episodes of barotrauma are mild, easily treated or recover spontaneously and do not require the therapy to be abandoned. Less commonly, HBOT may be associated with acute neurological toxicity manifesting as seizure.</P>
<P>While we have made every effort to locate further unpublished data, it remains possible that this review is subject to a positive publication bias, with generally favourable trials more likely to achieve reporting. With regard to long-term outcomes following HBOT and any effect on the quality of life for these patients, we have located no relevant data.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-10 14:20:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence from methodologically poor studies that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves hearing in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) who present within two weeks of hearing loss, and some indication that HBOT might improve tinnitus presenting in the same time frame. However, there is no evidence that any improvement is functionally important. Thus, the routine use of HBOT in these patients cannot be justified by this review. The small number of studies, the modest numbers of patients, and the methodological and reporting inadequacies of the primary studies included in this review demand a cautious interpretation. Moreover, this review does not give any information regarding the safety of HBOT for these patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-29 10:48:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Given the findings of improved hearing with the use of HBOT in these patients, there is a case for large randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit (if any) from the administration of HBOT. Specifically, more information is required on the subset of disease severity and time of presentation most likely to be associated with a benefit from this therapy. The effect of differing oxygen dosage and effect of other therapies administered simultaneously is not known. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences;</LI>
<LI>careful definition and selection of target patients;</LI>
<LI>appropriate range of oxygen doses per treatment session (pressure and time) as well as total number of treatments;</LI>
<LI>appropriate and carefully defined comparator therapy;</LI>
<LI>use of an effective sham therapy;</LI>
<LI>effective and explicit blinding of outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>appropriate outcome measures including all those listed in this review;</LI>
<LI>careful elucidation of any adverse effects; and</LI>
<LI>the cost-utility of the therapy.</LI>
