<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence of efficacy of alpha lipoic acid for dementia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is one of a number of potent antioxidants for which a potential therapeutic role in dementia has been postulated. This suggestion arises from the possibility that oxidative and inflammatory processes contribute to the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease. Whilst ALA has been used as part of the treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, no placebo-controlled randomized trials have been conducted for its use in degenerative dementias. ALA for the treatment of dementia of any subtype cannot currently be recommended.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Oxidative processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer's disease. Protecting the central nervous system against these damaging mechanisms may be a useful therapeutic approach. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an endogenous antioxidant that interrupts cellular oxidative processes in both its oxidized and reduced forms. These properties might qualify ALA for a modulatory role in the treatment of people with dementia.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the role and clinical efficacy of alpha lipoic acid in the treatment of dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 3 January 2008 using the terms 'alpha lipoic acid' and 'thioctic'. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-22 11:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>All double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of alpha lipoic acid in dementia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 11:06:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>No meta-analysis could be performed. A systematic search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, as well as registers of ongoing and unpublished trials, could not identify any studies investigating the use of ALA for dementia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In the absence of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials investigating ALA for dementia, no evidence exists to explore any potential effects. Until data from trials become available for analysis, ALA cannot be recommended for people with dementia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-22 11:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>In the UK there are now more people aged over 60 than there are aged under 16 and the number of people aged over 85 has increased five-fold since 1951 to reach 1.1 million (The United Kingdom National Census 2001 <LINK REF="REF-ONS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2002</LINK>). With 20% of people aged over 80 having a dementing illness (<LINK REF="REF-Jorm-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 1987</LINK>), there is a growing need for more effective therapeutic interventions. Inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms involving cytokines, prostaglandins, free radicals and glial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and raise possibilities for new approaches to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Tabet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabet 2000</LINK>). Tissues of the central nervous system are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of their constant high rate of oxygen consumption and high mitochondrial density. Antioxidant drugs, including alpha lipoic acid (ALA), that attenuate such reactions, are being explored as potential neuro-protective agents in neurodegenerative conditions.</P>
<P>Alpha lipoic acid (ALA; thioctic acid; 1,2-dithiolane-3 pentanoic acid; 1,2-dithiolane-3-valeric acid; 6,8-thioctic acid) is a potent antioxidant, originally isolated as an acetate-replacing factor (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reed-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1957</LINK>). At first tentatively classified as a vitamin (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1959</LINK>), it was later found to be synthesized by humans and other animals (<LINK REF="REF-Carreau-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carreau 1979</LINK>). It is now known to be intimately connected to cell metabolism and redox state (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1997</LINK>). ALA is a low molecular weight antioxidant, readily absorbed from the diet or an oral dose, and crosses the blood-brain barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1992</LINK>). It is essential for normal oxidative metabolism, playing a vital role as a cofactor in mitochondrial dehydrogenase reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Gilgun_x002d_Sherki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilgun-Sherki 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, it has antioxidant activity in its oxidized and in its reduced form as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). DHLA regenerates through redox cycling with other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and raises levels of intracellular glutathione, an important thiol antioxidant (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholich-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholich 1989</LINK>), and coenzyme Q10 levels (<LINK REF="REF-Kagan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagan 1990</LINK>). ALA also chelates certain metals, forming stable complexes with copper, manganese and zinc (<LINK REF="REF-Sigel-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigel 1978</LINK>). ALA is therefore a promising candidate as an antioxidant agent in neurodegenerative diseases; it can interrupt oxidant processes at several points by competing for free transition metals as a chelator (<LINK REF="REF-Devasagayam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devasagayam 1991</LINK>), by scavenging hydroxyl or superoxide radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 1991</LINK>), and by scavenging peroxyl radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Kagan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagan 1992</LINK>). Few other antioxidants possess this versatility. ALA also modulates nitric oxide levels in brain and neural tissue, which may have effects in neurodegeneration, learning, cognition, and aging (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1995</LINK>). ALA is already used as a therapeutic agent in a variety of neurological disorders such as diabetic neuropathy and polyneuritis where patients have been found to have reduced levels of endogenous ALA (<LINK REF="REF-Estrada-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estrada 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumathi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumathi 1996</LINK>). Allergic skin conditions are among the few reported adverse effects of ALA administration in humans.</P>
<P>In Alzheimer's disease, increased iron concentrations are associated with neurons containing the neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Good-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 1992</LINK>). Such increased iron levels are hypothesized to increase free-radical mediated reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>). Substantial evidence also suggests that beta-amyloid (Aß) is associated with oxidative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Behl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behl 1994</LINK>), stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage neuronal membrane lipids, proteins and nucleic acids (<LINK REF="REF-Halliwell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliwell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>). Furthermore microglia and astrocytes, in attempting to degrade senile plaques, generate free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 and 6, as well as tumour-necrosis factor alpha, all of which can damage adjacent nervous tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Neumann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 1999</LINK>). Other factors, such as age- and stress-related energy deficits may also contribute to diminished ability of neurons to cope with free radicals as well as to repair damaged structures (<LINK REF="REF-Blum_x002d_Degen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum-Degen 1995</LINK>). Both reduction of amyloid synthesis and antioxidant administration have been proposed as treatments for Aß mediated neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, animal and preliminary human studies indicate that ALA has neuroprotective effects on Aß-mediated cytotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>ALA has received increased attention following studies claiming a partial reversal of memory loss in aged rats. It has been proposed that ALA supplementation restores long-term potentiation in aged rodents (<LINK REF="REF-McGahon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGahon 1999</LINK>), partially restores memory loss during ageing (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002b</LINK>) and improves long-term memory in aged female mice (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1993</LINK>). Animal studies also suggest that ALA confers protection against oxidative damage in neuronal tissue and delays mitochondrial decay and ageing. Both prevention and reversal of abnormalities with ALA in ageing rat brain were associated with normalization of lipid peroxidation and partial restoration in the activities of various enzymatic antioxidants. Stoll concluded that ALA free-radical scavenging ability might improve NMDA receptor density, leading to improved memory (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994</LINK>). ALA supplementation was also claimed to restore depleted mitochondrial antioxidant status in aged rats so suggesting a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of brain ageing and age-associated neurodegenerative disorders (where free radicals are possibly a major causative factor) (<LINK REF="REF-Arivazhagan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arivazhagan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Socci-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socci 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a non-randomized case series, elderly people with dementia were given ALA. Findings suggested a stabilization of cognitive functions, as demonstrated by constant scores in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog) over a study period of 337 ± 80 days (<LINK REF="REF-Hager-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hager 2001</LINK>). This was a small pilot study of nine subjects with different dementia subtypes, all maintained on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for at least three months with poor matching for sex (eight men, one woman). The study has subsequently been extended to 43 subjects over an observation period of 48 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hager-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 2007</LINK>). Disease progression was lower than reported data used for comparison. However, little can be concluded from these findings and the authors acknowledge the need for formal randomized placebo-controlled trials. The use of ALA in HIV-related cognitive decline has also been investigated in a small study. One group of nine HIV patients received ALA alone and a second group received ALA combined with selegiline (deprenyl). Changes in neuropsychological test scores at four and 10 weeks of ALA treatment showed no discernible benefits, despite ALA being well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Dana-Consortium-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dana Consortium 1998</LINK>). However, these findings relate to processes differing widely from those that occur in the degenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease.</P>
<P>Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between the increased production of oxygen free-radicals, and the anti-oxidative defences and repair of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA (<LINK REF="REF-Halliwell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliwell 1992</LINK>). The production of reactive oxygen free-radicals is a normal phenomenon in tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Halliwell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliwell 1999</LINK>) and there are a number of defence mechanisms. Permanently increasing oxidative stress may result from a decline in efficiency of these mechanisms during ageing (<LINK REF="REF-Hussain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussain 1995</LINK>). Brain tissue may be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress in part because it is highly enriched in non-haem iron which acts catalytically in the production of oxygen free-radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Subbarao-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbarao 1990</LINK>). In addition brain contains relatively high levels of unsaturated fatty acids that are particularly good substrates for peroxidation reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 1994</LINK>). If, as is thought, the major defence mechanisms in the brain involve enzymatic antioxidants (<LINK REF="REF-Reiter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 1995</LINK>), then, in theory, replenishing the brain with synthetic antioxidants might provide a therapeutic approach to reduce oxidative stress and aid in the treatment or prevention of age-associated memory impairment and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>With no completed studies currently retrieved these methods remain in place for potential future studies.</P>
<P>Selection of studies:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Four reviewers (AK, JS, NT and RH) will independently examine all references retrieved by the search. Three reviewers (AK, JS, NT) following clearly defined inclusion criteria will independently select trials assessing the effectiveness of alpha-lipoic acid in dementia. Any disagreements will be discussed and brought to the fourth reviewer (RH) for resolution.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Quality assessment:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The four reviewers will assess the quality of methodology of each selected trial with reference to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data collection:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data will be extracted by the same four independent reviewers.</LI>
<LI>Data will be extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline are not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point would be extracted. The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months before.</LI>
<LI>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest will be sought.</LI>
<LI>For each outcome measure, data will be sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data will be sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data is not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial will be sought and indicated as such.</LI>
<LI>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization will be eligible for inclusion.</LI>
<LI>Data from titration phases prior to the randomized phase will not be used to assess safety or efficacy because patients will usually not be randomized, nor will treatments be concealed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data analysis:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data will treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</LI>
<LI>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) are required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. For cross-over trials only the data from the first treatment period will be used.</LI>
<LI>When changes from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics will be calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time will be assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome is the weighted mean difference where the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardized mean difference (the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation) where they used different rating scales or tests.</LI>
<LI>The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the range is considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis, data will be divided between smaller time periods and a separate meta-analysis is conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been made.</LI>
<LI>For binary outcomes, such as dead or alive, and clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio is used to measure treatment effect.</LI>
<LI>Overall estimates of the treatment difference will be presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effects model will be presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic performed. If there is significant heterogeneity a random effects model will be presented.</LI>
<LI>If a test of heterogeneity is negative then a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials will be calculated. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results will be pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals will be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</LI>
<LI>A separate meta-analysis will be performed for each dementia subgroup (for example, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies).</LI>

<P>No completed randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of ALA for people with dementia were identified from the CDCIG register or from any of the other sources. The author of a previously identified trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shinto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shinto 2004</LINK>) was contacted and we were informed that a pilot study has been completed but results have not been published. The lipoic acid intervention consisted of omega-3 fatty acid plus lipoic acid and therefore this study has been excluded from this review.</P>

<P>There are three excluded studies in this review, detailed below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hager-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 2007</LINK>. This study is not double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized. Nevertheless it reports slowing of disease progression with alpha lipoic acid in Alzheimer's disease, and suggests that alpha lipoic acid might have a neuroprotective role.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shinto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shinto 2004</LINK>. This study did not have a pure alpha lipoic acid intervention. Results of the pilot study are not yet published. An abstract presented at the American Academy of Neurology in April 2008 concluded that omega-3 fatty acid plus lipoic acid showed advantages over placebo in MMSE and activities of daily living.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Galasko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 2005</LINK>. This study again does not have a pure alpha lipoic acid intervention. Vitamin E and Vitamin C is given along with alpha lipoic acid and therefore it has been excluded from this review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-22 11:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There are no data available from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. It is not possible to comment on the use of ALA for the treatment of any form of dementia.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the evidence currently available, ALA cannot be recommended for the treatment of dementia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>ALA has shown promise in animal studies but there are no randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials in people with dementia. Such trials are needed. </P>
