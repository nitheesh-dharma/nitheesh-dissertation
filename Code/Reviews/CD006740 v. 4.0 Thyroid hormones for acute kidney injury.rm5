<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-11 16:37:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a number of causes including infection, trauma, kidney stones, toxic drugs, or acquired during hospital treatment. People with AKI suddenly lose kidney function leading to poor urine output and retention of body wastes. In every 1000 people who are discharged from hospital about 30 are diagnosed with AKI; about 6% of all critically ill patients have AKI. Many people with AKI will die from the disease.</P>
<P>AKI treatment aims to restore kidney function using drugs, kidney dialysis, or both. Experimental animal studies of thyroid hormone therapy (a drug treatment) held promise, but uncertainty existed about its effectiveness and safety for people. </P>
<P>We searched the medical literature to investigate the benefits and harms of thyroid hormone therapy for adults with AKI of any cause who were in hospital and found two studies that involved 97 people. There were many differences between study populations, particularly participants' kidney history (some had their own kidneys; others had transplants); and the drugs that were investigated. These differences meant that we were unable to statistically evaluate (meta-analyse) study data. </P>
<P>We found that risk of death from any cause was much higher among people with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy compared with those who received placebo in one study; no deaths were reported in the second study. Thyroid hormone therapy was found to be no better or worse than placebo in changing patients' needs for kidney dialysis or transplant. People with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy needed dialysis for longer than those who received placebo in one study, but no differences in AKI and dialysis durations were noted in the other. Lengths of stay in intensive care units and hospital were similar in both those who received thyroid hormone therapy and placebo in one study; but not reported in the other study. Neither study reported if any participants progressed to end-stage kidney disease. We had planned to analyse changes in kidney function and numbers of dialysis sessions, but data reporting was insufficient to make assessments.</P>
<P>The included studies were few in number, small in size, and low in methodological quality. The available evidence suggested that use of thyroid hormone therapy was associated with worse outcomes in patients with established AKI, and therefore, use of these therapies should be avoided for these people.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-11 14:32:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI), which is common in hospitalised patients, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances in treatment, AKI outcomes have not changed substantially during the past four decades, and incidence is increasing. There is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic agents and revisit some older drugs to review their roles in the management of AKI. Although thyroid hormone therapy has shown promise in experimental animal studies, clinical efficacy and safety have not been systematically assessed for the management of people with AKI. </P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) that compared any dose or form of thyroid hormone therapy alone or in combination with other agents compared with placebo or supplemental treatment (such as furosemide, dopamine, or atrial natriuretic peptide) in adult AKI patients.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-14 18:37:57 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes (death, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), we planned to express results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (length of hospital stay, durations of AKI and RRT), we planned to use the mean difference (MD).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-20 13:35:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two studies, enrolling 97 participants, met our inclusion criteria.<B> </B>The studies differed significantly in terms of study populations, natural history of AKI (multifactorial AKI in patients with native kidneys versus delayed graft function associated with acute tubular necrosis in transplant recipients), and study interventions; hence, data were not meta-analysed. One study reported a significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality associated with thyroid hormone interventions compared with placebo (59 participants, RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.21 to 9.12); no deaths were reported in the other study. Both studies reported no significant difference in the need for RRT associated with thyroid hormone therapy when compared to placebo. Neither study reported incidence of progression to ESKD. There was a significantly longer duration of AKI (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.82) and RRT (5.00 days, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.95) associated with thyroid hormone therapy compared with placebo in one study; no differences in durations of AKI (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI -3.53 to 7.53) and RRT (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI -2.36 to 6.36) were noted in the other study. One study reported similar lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital in both intervention and control arms (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -8.17 to 7.77); the other did not report this outcome. No adverse events were noted to be associated with thyroid hormone therapy in either study. Adequate data were not available to assess changes in kidney function or numbers of RRT sessions. Both included studies were small and methodological quality was suboptimal.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-11 13:57:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found a paucity of large, high quality studies to inform analysis of thyroid hormone interventions for the treatment of people with AKI. Current evidence suggested that thyroid hormone therapy may be associated with worse outcomes for patients with established AKI; therefore, its use for these patients should be avoided. The role of thyroid hormone therapy in preventing AKI has not been adequately investigated and may be considered in future clinical studies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-14 18:29:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a general term applied to describe an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function that results in retention of nitrogenous (urea and creatinine) and non-nitrogenous waste products (<LINK REF="REF-Lameire-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lameire 2005</LINK>). Commonly applied definitions of AKI are &#8220;an increase in serum creatinine of &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (44 µmol/L) over the baseline value&#8221;, &#8220;an increase of more than 50 percent over the baseline value&#8221;, &#8220;a reduction in the calculated creatinine clearance of more than 50 percent&#8221;, or &#8220;a decrease in renal function that results in the need for renal replacement therapy&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solomon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanardo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanardo 1994</LINK>). More recently, the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) has defined AKI as an abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr &gt; 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 µmol/L), a percentage increase in SCr &gt; 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than six hours) (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>). AKI can be caused by a variety of conditions, which can be broadly divided into three categories: prerenal, postrenal and intrinsic renal (<LINK REF="REF-Lameire-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lameire 2005</LINK>). The prerenal form accounts for approximately 70% of community-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1991</LINK>) and 21% of hospital-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Lia_x00f1_o-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaño 1996</LINK>) and results from decreased kidney perfusion. In postrenal AKI, which constitutes around 10% of all AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Lia_x00f1_o-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaño 1996</LINK>), the urinary collection system is obstructed due to either intrinsic or extrinsic causes. In the intrinsic form, which constitutes about 70% of AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Lia_x00f1_o-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaño 1996</LINK>), structures of the nephron such as the glomeruli, tubules, vessels, or the interstitium, are primarily affected. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury, a major cause of AKI, has been thought recently to be immunologically mediated with evidence supporting involvement of both innate and adaptive immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsey 2008</LINK>). Sepsis, hypovolaemia, drug toxicity, and major surgery are some of the most commonly associated conditions of hospital-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>).  </P>
<P>The overall incidence of AKI has been estimated at a rate of around 24 to 30 cases/1000 hospital discharges (<LINK REF="REF-Waikar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waikar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xue-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2006</LINK>) and affects approximately 6% of critically ill patients (<LINK REF="STD-Guerin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guerin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>). The AKI mortality rate is 40% to 80%; higher rates are associated with concomitant sepsis, hypotension and multiple organ failure (<LINK REF="REF-Brivet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brivet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>). AKI can be classified as oliguric (urine output &lt; 400 mL/d) or non-oliguric (urine output &gt; 400 mL/d). Oliguria has been considered a risk factor for mortality in several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chertow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chertow 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lia_x00f1_o-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaño 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2002</LINK>). The percentage of patients who need dialysis is between 20% and 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Lia_x00f1_o-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaño 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascual-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 1990</LINK>). Of these, fewer than 25% of patients who survive initial dialysis progress to requiring long-term dialysis, indicating that AKI is a potentially reversible condition (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spurney-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spurney 1991</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Despite recent advances in treatment, AKI outcomes have not changed substantially during the past four decades, and incidence is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Jo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jo 2007</LINK>). There is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic agents and revisit some older agents to review their roles in the management of AKI.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-03 16:33:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In animal studies, thyroid hormone therapy has been shown to improve recovery from toxic and ischaemic acute tubular necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gaudio-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudio 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulte_x002d_Wesserman-1977a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte-Wesserman 1977a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulte_x002d_Wessermann-1977b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte-Wessermann 1977b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1984</LINK>). The mechanism of action of thyroid hormone in AKI, although unknown, is thought to be related to enhanced epithelial recovery by enhancing endogenous epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated renal repair (<LINK REF="REF-Humes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humes 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiken-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiken 1994</LINK>). In this review, thyroid hormone therapy refers to any preparation of thyroid hormone, such as T4 and T3 preparations.</P>

<P>There have been no previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that address the benefits and harms of thyroid hormone therapy for people with AKI.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>The evidence was found to suggest that the use of thyroid hormone therapy for patients with established AKI may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, and increased durations of both AKI and need for RRT. This review included two studies (97 participants). <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2000</LINK> was conducted in a population with established AKI attributable to toxins (antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, myoglobin, and radiocontrast agents), ischaemia, sepsis, or ischaemia and sepsis. <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2002</LINK> was conducted in a population of kidney transplant recipients who received grafts from deceased donors; participants had established delayed graft function mostly due to acute tubular necrosis. The included patient populations were clinically euthyroid and had comparable thyroid function tests in both intervention and control arms (<LINK REF="STD-Acker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2002</LINK>). The included studies differed significantly in terms of study populations, AKI natural history (multifactorial AKI in patients with native kidneys versus delayed graft function in transplant recipients), and study interventions. This meant that we were unable to conduct meta-analyses from the available data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with existing studies</HEADING>
<P>Thyroid hormone therapy has been demonstrated in animal studies to improve recovery from toxic and ischaemic acute tubular necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gaudio-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudio 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulte_x002d_Wesserman-1977a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte-Wesserman 1977a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulte_x002d_Wessermann-1977b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte-Wessermann 1977b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1984</LINK>). An uncontrolled clinical trial in a paediatric population also demonstrated promising results (<LINK REF="STD-Straub-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Straub 1976</LINK>). However, this review of randomised controlled trials that investigated the role of thyroid hormone therapy for adults with AKI found that this intervention was not associated with any clinical benefits and may contribute to poorer clinical outcomes such as mortality and longer durations of AKI and RRT. Along with interventions such as atrial natriuretic peptide (<LINK REF="REF-Nigwekar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nigwekar 2009</LINK>), thyroid hormone therapy represents an intervention with beneficial effects in experimental animal models that did not translate to clinical AKI settings.</P>
<P>Experimental animal models of AKI are simplified, controlled, and often restricted to a single identifiable mechanism of injury; but because the pathogenesis of clinical AKI is very complex, such characteristics are difficult to reproduce in clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jo 2007</LINK>). This effect may explain differences in outcomes seen in the included studies. Furthermore, the patient population in <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2000</LINK> had very advanced AKI, and at that stage, it was unlikely that interventions such as thyroid hormone therapy, whose action is enhanced by epithelial recovery (endogenous epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated renal repair), would be effective. In both included studies, administration of thyroid hormone therapy was associated with sustained suppression of serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels in intervention arm participants (<LINK REF="STD-Acker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2002</LINK>). Serum thyroid stimulating hormone level suppression was correlated with poor outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Acker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Acker 2000</LINK>, indicating that euthyroid patients with clinical AKI should not receive thyroid hormone therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>Strengths of our review include a systematic search of medical databases, data extraction and independent study quality assessment by two authors based on an established protocol (New Reference). However, included studies were few in number, small, comprised of populations with different manifestations of AKI of variable severity, and interventions differed significantly. Such factors limited making comparisons between the included studies so that we were unable to conduct meta-analyses. It is possible thyroid hormone therapy may confer differential effects in different AKIN proposed stages (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>). However, we were unable to analyse the effects of thyroid hormone therapy for these different stages. Despite these limitations, our results provide the most comprehensive review of benefits and harms of thyroid hormone therapy administration in the management of AKI to date. It is suggested that thyroid hormone therapy for treatment of people with AKI be avoided.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-05-11 15:58:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There are no large, high quality studies that address the role of thyroid hormone treatment for people with AKI. Current available evidence suggests that use of thyroid hormone therapy could be associated with worse outcomes in patients with established AKI. This effect may be mediated by the sustained suppression of serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels caused by administering thyroid hormone therapy. Thus, thyroid hormone therapy for the treatment of people with AKI should be avoided.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-20 13:13:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that evidence has not been identified to indicate that thyroid hormone therapy for people with AKI confers beneficial effects, future studies should consider investigation of other interventions. If attempted, future studies of thyroid hormone therapy for people with established AKI should carefully examine end-points of harm. The role of thyroid hormone therapy in preventing AKI was not assessed in this review. Future investigators may consider assessing the safety and efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy in this capacity. Given the results from intervention studies conducted in people with AKI, any future prevention studies should pay particular attention to safety issues. Mortality and RRT can be competing outcomes in the critically ill population, and it is possible that some patients with AKI may not survive to need RRT. A composite outcome such as dialysis-free survival may therefore be more meaningful and should be considered. Investigators should consider building the collaborative networks that are needed to adequately power definitive results. Furthermore, future studies should consider populations who are at high risk of AKI such as people with chronic kidney disease. Novel biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, interleukin-18 and others may help to identify high risk populations (<LINK REF="REF-Coca-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coca 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parikh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, these biomarkers may be applied as enrolment criteria for future clinical trials aimed at prevention of AKI.</P>
