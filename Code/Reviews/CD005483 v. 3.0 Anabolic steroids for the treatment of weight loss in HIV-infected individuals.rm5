<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-11-10 16:06:21 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">Anabolic steroids for the treatment of weight loss in HIV-infected individuals</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Anabolic steroids may be beneficial in the treatment of weight loss in HIV-infected individuals. Anabolic steroids include testosterone and its derivatives. One of the functions of testosterone is to help build muscle. Testosterone has been demonstrated to increase muscle mass and lean body mass in testosterone-deficient but otherwise healthy men. Individuals with HIV infection often lose weight and have low blood levels of testosterone; thus, the use of anabolic steroids in the treatment of weight loss in individuals with HIV infection may be beneficial. The purpose of this review was to evaluate anabolic steroids as a means of treatment of weight loss in individuals with HIV infection. The review includes 13 randomized clinical trials in the primary analysis. The results suggested that anabolic steroids increased both lean body mass and body weight. However, the results were not consistent among individual trials and the average increase was small and may not be clinically relevant. Furthermore, the results need to be interpreted with caution as this meta-analysis was limited due to small sample sizes; short duration of treatment and of follow-up; and heterogeneity of the study populations, the anabolic interventions, and concomitant therapies.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Individuals with HIV infection often lose weight during the course of their disease. Furthermore, low serum concentrations of testosterone are common in individuals with HIV infection, particularly those with weight loss. Treatment of weight loss with anabolic steroids in HIV-infected individuals may be beneficial.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of anabolic steroids for the treatment of weight loss in adults with HIV infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, AIDSearch, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, and the National Library of Medicine Gateway Abstracts for controlled trials up to April 2005. We also searched the bibliographies of the identified studies and review the articles. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers of anabolic steroids were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of an anabolic steroid to placebo to treat weight loss in adults with HIV were included. Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of anabolic steroids to placebo for the treatment of weight loss in adults with HIV were selected. Change from baseline in lean body mass or in body weight was reported as on outcome measure.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for quality of randomization, blinding, withdrawals, and adequacy of allocation concealment. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated. For dichotomous outcomes, risk differences, were calculated. Because of uncertainty as to whether consistent true effects exist in such different populations and treatments, the authors decided a priori to use random effects models for all outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Two hundred ninety-four individuals randomized to anabolic steroid therapy and 238 individuals randomized to placebo were included in the analysis of efficacy for change from baseline in lean body mass. Three hundred forty-three individuals randomized to anabolic steroid and 286 randomized to placebo were included in the analysis of efficacy for change from baseline in body weight. The mean methodologic quality of the included studies was 4.1, of a maximum 5 points. Although significant heterogeneity was present for both outcomes, the average change in lean body mass was 1.3 kg (95% CI: 0.6, 2.0), while the average change in total body weight was 1.1 kg (95% CI: 0.3, 2.0). A total of eight deaths occurred during the treatment period; four in the anabolic steroid treatment groups and four in the placebo-treatment groups (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.03, 0.03). The risk difference for withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events was 0.00 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.03).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although the results of the trials were heterogeneous, on average, the administration of anabolic steroids appeared to result in a small increase in both lean body mass and body weight as compared with placebo. While these results suggest that anabolic steroids may be useful in the treatment of weight loss in HIV infected individuals, due to limitations, treatment recommendations cannot be made. Further information is required regarding the long-term benefit and adverse effects of anabolic steroid use, the specific populations for which anabolic steroid therapy may be most beneficial, and the optimal regime. In addition, the correlation of improvement in lean body mass with more clinically relevant endpoints, such as physical functioning and survival, needs to be determined.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>HIV-infected individuals often develop wasting during the course of their disease. In prospective and retrospective cohort studies of HIV-infected individuals, increasing weight loss was found to be significantly associated with decreased survival, as well as with reduced quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bhasin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhasin 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mulligan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulligan 1999</LINK>). In addition, studies have demonstrated that decreased survival is more clearly associated with changes in lean body mass than with changes in total body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Mulligan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulligan 1999</LINK>). Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, in particular highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-associated wasting remains a problem for many individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Smit-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smit 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wanke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanke 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Hypogonadism, a condition associated with low testosterone levels, may be a factor contributing to wasting in HIV-infection. Low levels of testosterone occur frequently in men with AIDS, and have also been demonstrated in women with HIV infection and wasting (<LINK REF="REF-Grinspoon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grinspoon 1997</LINK>). Hypogonadism may cause greater loss of lean body mass than fat mass. Corcoran et al reported that, in a study of men with hypogonadism and AIDS wasting (<LINK REF="REF-Grinspoon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grinspoon 1996</LINK>), muscle mass was 75% of the predicted value according to height, while total body weight was 92% of predicted value according to height (<LINK REF="REF-Corcoran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corcoran 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, it is possible that the therapeutic use of anabolic steroids (androgenic hormones that include or are derivatives of testosterone) will be beneficial in HIV-infected individuals with weight loss, in terms of increasing lean body mass, body weight, quality of life, and overall survival. However, adverse effects of androgens may include acne, water retention, hepatic toxicity, and endocrine effects including decreased glucose tolerance and alterations in lipid profiles. Additionally adverse effects include thegrowth of facial hair or menstrual irregularities in women, and azoospermia and gynecomastia in men (<LINK REF="REF-Snyder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>(For a discussion of the physiologic effects, routes of delivery, and adverse effects of anabolic steroids, see Appendix 1.)</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of anabolic steroids compared to placebo for the treatment of weight loss in HIV-infected adults.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomized controlled clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this systematic review. However, the trial published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 1996</LINK>) was excluded from the primary analysis. It was included in secondary sensitivity analyses only. Trials in which all patients were treated with open label anabolic steroid and subsequently randomized to a discontinuation phase of anabolic steroid or placebo were not included in this review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials involving participants 18 years of age or older with both HIV infection and weight loss of any amount were included in this review. Trials involving either men or women or both were included, as were trials involving either eugonadal or hypogonadal individuals.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of an anabolic steroid to placebo to treat weight loss in adults with HIV were included. Anabolic steroids included any androgen, either synthetic or non-synthetic, by any route of administration. It was decided by the reviewers, a priori, that the intervention should be given for at least six weeks, as such a time frame was considered necessary to observe clinically significant changes in body weight or body composition (<LINK REF="STD-Rabkin-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Rabkin 2000b</LINK>). Other interventions, such as nutritional counselling, exercise, or other drug therapies, were accepted as concomitant therapy, provided they were distributed similarly between anabolic steroid and control treatment groups.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Trials where outcome measures included change from baseline in either lean body mass, fat free mass, or body cell mass and/or change from baseline in body weight were included in this review. However, trials where these outcome measures were reported as medians or without a measure of variability (<LINK REF="STD-Phanuphak" TYPE="STUDY">Phanuphak</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schambelan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schambelan 2001</LINK>) were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, and Current Contents using the OVID interface; EMBASE; AIDSearch using NISC BiblioLine; and the abstracts in the National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLM). MeSH headings included: HIV infections, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, body weight, body composition, androgens, androgens synthetic. Keywords used for the search included: HIV, AIDS, weight, wasting, lean body mass, body mass, body composition, cachexia, and the names for each of the anabolic steroids. The Haynes systematic search filter for randomized trials (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1994</LINK>) was used in the OVID searches in order to restrict the search to potential randomized studies. A similar filter was used in the EMBASE and AIDSearch searches. A broad search was done of the NLM database. The OVID search strategy used can be found in Appendix 2.</P>
<P>CENTRAL was searched for the time period 1980 to February 2005; MEDLINE for 1980 to April 2005; CINAHL for 1982 to April 2005; Current Contents for 1998 to June 2003; and EMBASE for 1988 to February 2005. AIDSLINE was searched for the time period 1980 to December 1999 as this database was later discontinued; subsequently AIDSearch was searched for 1980 to February 2005. The abstracts contained in the National Library of Medicine were searched to April 2005.</P>
<P>No language restrictions were applied to these searches.</P>
<P>The lists of references from the studies and review articles identified from the searches outlined above were manually searched to include any citations missed by the electronic searches.</P>
<P>Pharmaceutical manufacturers of anabolic steroids were contacted to identify further clinical studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection</P>
<P>Only studies published as full publications were considered in the primary analysis. Trials published as abstracts or as letters to the editor were included in a secondary sensitivity analysis. Duplicate publications or publications involving the same patients but different outcomes were included once. Agreement between the two reviewers, regarding the initial review of the electronic searches, was assessed using the kappa statistic. In the case of disagreement, the two observers discussed the issue and attempted to reach consensus. If necessary, a third adjudicator (RC) was used.</P>
<P>Trials to be included in the review were determined independently by two reviewers (KJ, MB). Each reviewer reviewed the list of references and abstracts obtained from the above search strategy. References considered to possibly meet the inclusion criteria by either reviewer were retrieved and reviewed in full text. All trials meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. However, only those published as full peer-reviewed publications were considered in the primary meta-analysis, while those published as abstracts or provided by pharmaceutical companies were considered for inclusion in the secondary sensitivity analysis. Duplicate publications, or publications involving the same patients but different outcomes, were included only once. In the case of disagreement, the two reviewers discussed the reference and reached consensus. </P>
<P>Data Collection</P>
<P>The two reviewers extracted data from the trials using a pre-derived data extraction tool. In the case of disagreement, the two reviewers discussed the issue and attempted to reach a consensus. A third adjudicator was used as necessary. Data were entered into Review Manager Version 4.2 for Windows.</P>
<P>Data Collected</P>
<P>A) Baseline data:<BR/>Baseline data (means or proportions) were collected for each treatment group for each trial. Data regarding age (years), weight (kilograms), weight loss (kilograms), serum testosterone level (nmol/L), CD4 cell count (cells x 109/ L, and protease inhibitor therapy (%) were extracted. </P>
<P>B) Outcome data:<BR/>Data (mean change, standard deviation, and number of patients for the continuous variables; and number of participants with an event and total number of participants for the dichotomous variables) were extracted for each treatment group for each change at end of study time point from baseline in lean body mass, change from baseline in body weight, number of deaths, and number of study withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events. </P>
<P>The change from baseline in lean body mass was measured by change in either lean body mass, fat free mass, or body cell mass using any accepted measurement technique. For a further discussion of the definitions and methodology for determining the change in lean body mass, see Appendix 3. </P>
<P>C) Methodologic quality data:<BR/>The methodologic quality of each trial was assessed using validated assessment tools (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>,) based on the following parameters:<BR/>Allocation concealment- was allocation concealment adequate, uncertain, or clearly inadequate?<BR/>Randomization- was the trial described as randomized and was the method of randomization described and appropriate?<BR/>Blinding- was the trial described as double-blind and was the method of double-blinding described and appropriate?<BR/>Accounting for withdrawals- was there a description of withdrawals and drop-outs by treatment group?<BR/>For each study, allocation concealment was determined to be either: adequate, unclear, inadequate, or not used (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>); and a numerical score was assigned based on a validated five point scale which included items relating to randomization (2 points), blinding (2 points), and description of withdrawals and dropouts (1 point) (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Two reviewers reached consensus on the categorizations of allocation concealment and the numerical scores. </P>
<P>Change from baseline in lean body mass and body weight, were generally reported for only those participants that completed the study. Data on deaths and withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events, as well as baseline variables, were generally reported for all randomized participants. Although the authors were contacted in an attempt to obtain data on the efficacy variables for all randomized participants, these data were not available. Therefore, the data available in the published reports were extracted. In addition, although we had planned to extract data on change from baseline in quality of life and on number of participants with adverse drug reactions, these data were generally not available in sufficient detail to allow meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Data Synthesis</P>
<P>Comparisons between treatment groups for continuous outcomes including change from baseline in lean body mass and change from baseline in body weight were presented as mean differences in the change for each trial. Comparisons between treatment groups for dichotomous outcomes, including deaths and withdrawals from study or discontinuation of study treatment due to adverse events, are presented as risk differences for each trial. Risk ratios were not used because of the significant number of zero cells. One study (Bhasin 2000) had four treatment groups; testosterone verses placebo with or without exercise. Because results were not reported for the overall comparison of anabolic steroid versus placebo, this study was treated as two separate trials of testosterone verses placebo, one with concomitant exercise and one without. In addition, two studies (Hengge 2003a, Miller 1998) had three treatment groups, and compared the effect of two different doses of anabolic steroids verses placebo. For each of these trials, the results for the two anabolic steroid groups were treated as two separate trials, with the results for the placebo group based on half the numbers in that group. </P>
<P>A summary of the weighted treatment effect was calculated across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, RevMan Analyses, Version 1.0 for Windows. The results are expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD and 95% CI) for the continuous outcomes and as pooled risk differences (RD and 95% CI) for the dichotomous outcomes.</P>
<P>A random-effects model was used due to; the variety of anabolic steroids being tested, the differences in treatment durations, and the differences in study populations. It was suspected that heterogeneity would be significant for most comparisons. Thus, the method of DerSimonian and Laird was used in the calculation of the summary measures of treatment effect.</P>
<P>In order to explore the anticipated heterogeneity, subgroup analyses of trials included in the primary analysis were carried out by the following factors:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> ·gender (men, women, or men and women);</LI>
<LI> ·gonadal status for trials with men only (hypogonadal men, eugonadal men); </LI>
<LI> ·study treatment duration (6 months, 16 weeks, 12 weeks, 8 weeks);</LI>
<LI> ·study treatment dose (supraphysiologic, physiologic);</LI>
<LI> ·proportion of study participants on protease inhibitors at baseline (less than 60%, 60% or greater);</LI>
<LI> ·measurement technique used to measure lean body mass (DEXA, BIA);</LI>
<LI> ·methodologic quality score (5, 4, 3);</LI>
<LI> ·adequacy of allocation concealment (adequate, uncertain);</LI>
<LI> ·quality score on randomization (2, 1);</LI>
<LI> ·quality score on description of withdrawals (1, 0); and </LI>
<LI> ·total sample size of trial (less than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 or greater).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses by age could not be carried out as the mean ages of participants in each of the included studies were similar (range 34 to 42 years). Subgroup analysis by the quality score for blinding was not carried out as all studies scored 2. Total sample size was based on total number of randomized subjects in all treatment arms in a trial (i.e., in three arm and factorial design trials, sample size was categorized based upon all subjects in the trial). In the subgroup analyses based on factors with more than one level (i.e. study treatment dosage, study drug duration, methodologic quality score, trial sample size) categories were presented in order to attempt to determine any dosage, duration, quality, or sample size response relationship across trials.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results of the meta-analysis. These analyses examined the effects of inclusion of abstracts and methodologic quality. Analyses were repeated with abstracts included, as well as excluding studies with quality scores less than 4.</P>
<P>Potential publication bias (or other potential biases associated with smaller studies) as well as potential heterogeneity due to study size was assessed by preparing a funnel plot and examining it for asymmetry.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Quality was assessed, as described in the Methods section, by determining the adequacy of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), and by a validated five-point scale, which included items relating to randomization (2 points), blinding (2 points), and description of withdrawals and dropouts (1 point) (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Two reviewers reached consensus on the scores. </P>
<P>For the thirteen studies included in the primary analysis, seven were considered to have described adequate allocation concealment, while six did not provide sufficient description to determine the adequacy of allocation concealment. The mean quality score, on the five-point scale, of studies included in the primary analysis was 4.3. Six trials scored 5 points, five scored 4 points, and two scored 3 points. Considering the components of the quality score individually, seven studies scored 2 points for randomization while six scored 1 point. All thirteen studies scored 2 points for blinding. Ten studies scored 1 point for description of withdrawals while three scored 0 points.</P>

<I>Meta-analysis<BR/>
</I>
</B>
<I>
<BR/>Change from baseline in lean body mass:<BR/>
</I>The change from baseline in lean body mass was not measured in all studies included in the meta-analysis. In the analysis of the eleven studies in which it was measured, the heterogeneity was significant with an I<SUP>2 </SUP>of 72%, p &lt; 0.0001, although most of the results were to the right of the no effect line. The weighted mean difference (WMD) calculated using a random-effects model was 1.3 kg (95% CI: 0.6, 2.0) but, due to the heterogeneity, this needs to be interpreted with caution. In the subgroup analysis of men only, the WMD was 1.5 kg (95% CI: 0.4, 2.6) with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76%, p = 0.002); and in the subgroup of men with low testosterone levels, the WMD was 0.9 kg (95% CI: -0.2, 2.0) with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%, p = 0.04). In the subgroup analysis of women only, the WMD was 1.0 kg (95% CI: -0.3, 2.2) with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 81%, p = 0.001).</P>
<P>In order to explore the heterogeneity, trial results were subgrouped by treatment duration, treatment dose, proportion of subjects on protease inhibitors, measurement technique used to measure lean body mass, quality score and its individual components, adequacy of allocation concealment and sample size. No trends were noted when trials were ordered by treatment dose or duration. No difference in treatment effect was noted in trials using DEXA versus those using BIA to measure lean body mass, nor in those in which a higher proportion of participants were on protease inhibitors compared with trials in which a lower proportion of participants were on protease inhibitors (although data for this factor were not reported for all trials). When ordered by quality, the study of the lowest quality showed the only negative effect. When the analysis was repeated using only studies with a quality score of 4 or greater, the results were similar to those of the primary analysis. However, when only studies with a quality score of 5 were included, the WMD was 2.2 kg (95% CI: 1.4, 3.1), with an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 22%, p = 0.26. When the individual components of the score were considered, trials with a better score for randomization and trials with a better score for description of withdrawals showed somewhat larger treatment effects than those with low randomization scores or poor descriptions of withdrawals. These subgroup results need to be interpreted with caution given that subgroup analyses are observational by nature, and not based on randomized comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). Additionally, in this meta-analysis, multiple subgroup analyses were carried out and many were defined post-hoc.</P>
<P>No unpublished studies reported results on change in lean body mass.</P>
<P>The funnel plot (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) of the standard error of the WMD versus the WMD did not suggest publication bias; nor did it suggest that trials with a smaller standard error of the WMD produced a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect. </P>
<P>
<I>Change from baseline in body weight:<BR/>
</I>All thirteen trials included in the primary analysis for this meta-analysis reported results for change from baseline in body weight. As expected, the heterogeneity was significant as determined by the I<SUP>2</SUP> of 68% (p &lt; 0.0001). Differences from the individual trials occurred on both sides of the no effect zero line, although the majority occurred to the right of this line. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) calculated using a random-effects model was 1.1 kg (95% CI: 0.3, 2.0). However, although significant, this difference should be interpreted with caution given the heterogeneity present. Subgroup analyses of those trials that included men only, of those trials that included men known to be hypogonadal, and of those that included women only were carried out. In the eight trials that included men only, the heterogeneity remained significant (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%, p = 0.002) and the WMD was 0.8 kg (95% CI: -0.3, 1.8); in the five trials that included only hypogonadal men, the heterogeneity remained significant (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 66%, p = 0.01) and the WMD was 0.2 kg (95% CI: -1.1, 1.4); and in the four trials that included women only, the heterogeneity was large (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73%, p = 0.005) and the WMD was 1.3 kg (95% CI: -0.4, 3.1).</P>
<P>The observed heterogeneity was again explored for potential sources. No trends were noticed when trials were ordered by treatment. When categorized by treatment dose, the results in trials in which the dose was supraphysiologic showed a larger treatment effect than in those in which the dose was considered a physiologic replacement dose. There were no apparent differences in treatment effect between subgroups of studies defined by proportion of participants on protease inhibitors, adequacy of allocation concealment, or sample size. When ordered by quality, the lower quality studies produced negative effects, while the higher quality studies, on average, showed positive effects. In the sensitivity analysis, in which studies with low quality scores were excluded, the heterogeneity remained and the WMD of 1.4 kg (95% CI: 0.6, 2.3) was higher than that of the primary analysis. In the six studies with quality scores of 5, the WMD was 1.6 kg (95% CI: 0.5, 2.7). When the individual components of the quality score were considered, trials with a better score for randomization and trials with a better score for description of withdrawals showed somewhat larger treatment effects. Again, these subgroup results need to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>When all published and unpublished trials included in the analysis, the results were very similar to those of the primary analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 66%, p &lt; 0.0001, WMD = 1.2 kg, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.9).</P>
<P>The funnel plots of the standard error of the WMD versus the WMD for change from baseline in body weight for trials in the primary analysis (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), and for trials in the sensitivity analysis, in which the unpublished trial was also included (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), did not suggest publication bias. Furthermore, the funnel plots did not suggest that trials with smaller WMD standard errors produced more accurate estimate of the treatment effect. </P>
<P>
<I>Number of deaths:<BR/>
</I>In the ten trials included in the primary analysis that reported the number of deaths, the pooled risk difference was 0.00 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.03). There was no significant heterogeneity for this result. </P>
<P>
<I>Number of withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events:<BR/>
</I>Ten studies included in the primary analysis reported the number of withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events. Five adverse events were reported in the anabolic steroid treatment groups while none were reported in the placebo treatment groups. The pooled risk difference was 0.00 (95% CI -0.02, 0.03), with no significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Descriptive Analysis</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>We were unable to include all relevant information in the meta-analysis due to certain limitations; some of this information is summarized below.</P>
<P>Two unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Phanuphak" TYPE="STUDY">Phanuphak</LINK> , <LINK REF="STD-Schambelan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schambelan 2001</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis due to the unavailability of necessary summary statistics (i.e., the mean change in lean body mass and weight and its standard deviation). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Phanuphak" TYPE="STUDY">Phanuphak</LINK> showed increases in lean body mass and body weight with nandrolone with a dose response as compared to placebo, while the study of Schambelan showed no difference in the change in lean body mass or weight with testosterone compared to placebo, when both were used in conjunction with megestrol. The numerical results are summarized in the table "Characteristics of Excluded Studies."</P>
<P>All studies included in the meta-analysis documented withdrawals and discontinuations. There was little consistency among the studies in specifying the causes of discontinuations. Additionally, consistent methodology was not used to reporting adverse events. Meaningful analysis was further hampered by the fact that the studies used different anabolic steroid analogues, routes of delivery, doses, duration of therapy, and that events occurring could vary by gender.</P>
<P>Adverse events, when reported, were usually described as mild and reversible. Events were generally related to either application site reactions (pain, skin irritation) or consistent with reported side effects associated with the use of anabolic steroids. Adverse events included such events as increased liver function tests, acne, mild hirsutism, breast tenderness, clitoral enlargement, increased libido, increased aggressiveness/irritability and mood swings among others.</P>
<P>Six studies included statements indicating that any withdrawals or discontinuations were not related to adverse events. Explanations included refusal to continue, personal reasons or subject lost to follow-up. A further four studies did document the occasional subject in either arm discontinuing due to adverse events such as increased liver function studies, threatened or completed suicide, or anxiety/depression. Only one study clearly indicated that the adverse event causing discontinuation was treatment-related. This occurred in a subject who developed cannaliculus cholestasis on oral oxymetholone therapy. </P>
<P>In the studies included in the meta-analysis, there were very few reported deaths that occurred during treatment. In the three studies in which deaths occurred during treatment, a total of eight were documented, including four in the active therapy arms and four in the placebo arms. Seven of the deaths were considered AIDS-related. Additionally, one subject who committed suicide was considered to have experienced an adverse event.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Anabolic steroids are currently being used by HIV-infected individuals for the treatment of weight loss. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that these steroids, on average, increase both lean body mass and body weight. However, the magnitude of the increase is not large and may not be considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, these results need to be interpreted with caution because the estimate of the treatment effect was based on a relatively small sample size and significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analyses. This heterogeneity was likely introduced by multiple sources of variability across the studies, including differences in study populations (baseline weight, weight loss, testosterone level, and stage of HIV illness), differences in interventions (different dosages, formulations, treatment duration, and concomitant therapies) and differences in the methods of determining the changes in lean body mass. Because of the many sources of variability, it is not possible to determine the relative effects of each from the small number of studies available.</P>
<P>In addition, it is not known whether improvements in the end points analysed in this meta-analysis correlate with more clinically relevant endpoints such as survival time, increased muscle strength and physical functioning, and overall quality of life. Finally, it should be noted, that in terms of safety and efficacy, the studies reported in this meta-analysis only studied the short-term effects of anabolic steroids.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>While the data available suggest that the use of anabolic steroids in HIV-infected individuals with associated weight loss will result in small increases in lean body mass and body weight without significant numbers of adverse effects, there are significant limitations in these data and the meta-analysis. Furthermore, while theoretically an increase in lean body mass should lead to improved physical functioning and quality of life, and ultimately to increased survival, this has not been demonstrated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research into the use of anabolic steroids to treat HIV wasting disease is required to explore:<BR/>1) the effectiveness of anabolic steroids in particular populations (such as those with low testosterone levels versus those with normal levels, those with differing severities of weight loss);<BR/>2) the best agent and dosage to be used in particular populations;<BR/>3) the optimal duration of treatment including the effects of cycling therapy;<BR/>4) the effects of concomitant therapies, particularly exercise and/or appetite stimulants; and<BR/>5) potential serious but uncommon adverse effects of anabolic steroids and potential adverse effects resulting from longer periods of administration of anabolic steroids. </P>
<P>In addition, changes in lean body mass or weight need to be correlated with more clinically relevant endpoints such as quality of life, improved physical functioning and survival. It may be possible to obtain some of this information from a systematic review of non-controlled trials or dose comparison trials in the literature, from observational studies using large clinical databases, and/or from review and pooling of actual individual patient data from the randomized studies conducted to date. However, for definitive answers to many of these questions, it will be necessary to conduct further randomized trials. </P>
<P>APPENDIX 1: The physiological effects, routes of delivery, and adverse effects of anabolic steroids</P>
<P>Anabolic steroids are androgenic hormones that include or are derivatives of testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Kashkin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashkin 1989</LINK>). Androgenic hormones are cholesterol derivatives that act on the androgen receptor and result in masculinizing effects. The main androgen in the plasma of men is testosterone, which is produced by the testis. In women, testosterone is synthesized in small amounts by both the ovary and adrenal gland. Androgens have been shown to have anabolic (nitrogen retaining) effects. These anabolic actions can result in increase strength and muscle mass (<LINK REF="REF-Snyder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 2001</LINK>). Studies of otherwise healthy hypogonadal men have shown significant increases in body weight and lean body mass with androgen administration (<LINK REF="REF-Bhasin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhasin 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1996</LINK>), while studies of eugonadal men have shown increases in lean body mass and strength with administration of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Bhasin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhasin 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The liver metabolizes testosterone very rapidly. Thus, in order to sustain effective levels, testosterone must be administered either parenterally as a short acting preparation (propionate) or as esterified long acting preparations (enanthate and cypionate) or by a transdermal delivery system. Other chemical modifications of testosterone have led to the production of androgens with greater anabolic than androgenic effects, (for example oxandrolone and nandrolone), and of some which can be taken orally, (for example oxandrolone and oxymetholone) (<LINK REF="REF-Snyder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of androgens in women may include growth of facial hair or menstrual irregularities. In children, disturbances in growth and osseous development can occur. In men, azoospermia may occur due to inhibition of gonadotropin secretion while conversion of androgens to estrogens may cause gynecomastia.

<P>APPENDIX 3: Definitions and methodology for determining outcome variables</P>
<P>The change in fat free body mass measured by any accepted technique was extracted. In general, either fat free mass, lean body mass, or body cell mass were measured. Fat free mass (FFM) refers to all mass that is not fat and includes both intracellular and extracellular water, lean body mass (LBM) is fat free mass minus bone mineral mass, and body cell mass (BCM) refers to the mass of metabolically active cells and thus includes intracellular water but excludes extracellular water (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1992</LINK>). Although each of the terms FFM, LBM, and BCM is different, it is assumed in this review that the change in any of these three measures of body composition reflects a change in the body cell mass or metabolically active tissue (i.e., that the change in bone mineral mass or extracellular fluid is minimal before and after treatment in comparison with the change in body cell mass). In addition, body composition can be measured by various techniques. The most commonly used techniques in the studies included in this review were bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (single or multiple frequency) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Bioelectrical impedance analysis measures the electrical conductivity through the body and uses equations to predict the various components of the body including total body water, fat free mass and body cell mass. Multiple frequency BIA is better able to distinguish extracellular from intracellular water fluids and thus results in better predictions of body composition, particularly in unwell populations. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry uses X-rays with two different energy intensities to measure fat mass, bone mineral mass, and lean body mass, and does not distinguish between extracellular and intracellular water.</P>
