<TITLE>Routine prophylactic stenting reduces the incidence of major urological complications in kidney transplant recipients</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 17:43:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage kidney disease, improving quality of life and extending the recipient's life expectancy. Interventions aimed at reducing the burden of post-transplant complications are a major area of research amongst the transplant community. Major urological complications (MUCs) (e.g. urine leak, obstruction) can occur in the immediate post-transplant period. This review aimed to determine the benefit and harms of the use of routine stenting in kidney transplant recipients in the prevention of urological complications. Seven studies (1154 patients) were identified. The incidence of MUCs were significantly reduced by the use of prophylactic stenting. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were more common in stented patients however the addition of antibiotic prophylaxis resulted in no difference in the incidence of UTIs between the two groups. More studies are needed to investigate the use of selective versus universal prophylactic stenting for the unresolved issues of quality of life and cost.<BR/>

<P>Major urological complications (MUCs) after kidney transplantation contribute to patient morbidity and compromise graft function. The majority arise from the vesicoureteric anastomosis and present early after transplantation. Ureteric stents have been successfully used to treat such complications. A number of centres have adopted a policy of universal prophylactic stenting, at the time of graft implantation, to reduce the incidence of urine leaks and ureteric stenosis. Stents are associated with specific complications and some centres advocate a policy of only stenting selected anastomoses.</P>

<P>Four reviewers assessed the studies for quality against four criteria (allocation concealment, blinding, intention-to-treat and completeness of follow-up). The primary outcome was the incidence of MUCs. Further outcomes of interest were graft and patient survival and the incidence of adverse events (urinary tract infection (UTI), haematuria, irritative symptoms, pain and stent migration). Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-08 17:37:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Seven RCTs (1154 patients) of low or moderate quality were identified. The incidence of MUCs was significantly reduced (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.77, P = 0.02, NNT 13) by universal prophylactic stenting. This was dependent on whether the same surgeon performed, or was in attendance, during the operations. Two patients lost their grafts to infective urinary tract complications in the stented group. UTIs, in general, were more common in stented patients (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15) unless the patients were prescribed cotrimoxazole 480 mg/d: in which case the incidence was equivalent (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.33). Stents appeared generally well tolerated, although studies using longer stents (&#8805; 20 cm) for longer periods (&gt; 6 weeks) had more problems with encrustation and migration.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-08 18:16:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Transplantation improves both quantity and quality of life for recipients. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, kidney graft demand greatly exceeds supply. A large body of research is developing into strategies to expand the donor pool and increase the supply of organs. Concurrently other groups are looking at ways to extend the life of kidney grafts by both reducing the burden of chronic allograft nephropathy and reducing the number of recipients dying with functioning grafts. There remain a small percentage of grafts lost in the early months post-transplantation to acute rejection and technical complications including vascular thrombosis. Major urological complications (MUCs) mostly originate from the vesicoureteric anastomosis, present early after transplantation (within three months) (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK>) and contribute to patient morbidity, graft loss and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Rigg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomalla-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomalla 1990</LINK>). The first kidney transplants were anastomosed using a transvesical approach (<LINK REF="REF-Merrill-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merrill 1956</LINK>). This technique, now more commonly known by the eponym Leadbetter-Politano (L-P)(<LINK REF="REF-Politano-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Politano 1958</LINK>), has been generally superceded by the extravesical ureteroneocystostomy (Lich-Gregoir) (L-G)(<LINK REF="REF-Konnak-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konnak 1972</LINK>) which is less technically demanding. Despite this there remains a significant morbidity with a recent review of case control studies reporting mean incidences of between 3% and 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Mangus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangus 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>vesicoureteric complications present either as urine leaks or collecting system obstruction. In the absence of technical complications, ureteric ischaemia (often related to the retrieval procedure) is thought to be chiefly responsible for the early ureteric complications post-transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Karam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karam 2004</LINK>). Both ureteric leak and obstruction have been successfully treated with "double-J" stent insertion, prompting surgeons to contemplate the use of prophylactic stents (<LINK REF="REF-Insall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insall 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stents have been successfully used in general urological practice for a number of years. The double-J stent consists of a straight tube with anchoring "j" loops at either end. In conventional urological practice the stent is straightened and inserted over a guidewire either via a cystoscope and/or under radiological guidance. Removal of the guidewire causes both ends to curl into their natural anchoring conformation. Placement of a stent during transplantation is a relatively simple procedure and requires no additional instrumentation or imaging. However, a further procedure to remove the stent is always required, may be inadvertently delayed and incurs further healthcare costs.</P>
<P>Conventional native ureteric repairs over stents are widely accepted to have a better outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1982</LINK>). In addition they have been successfully used in pyeloplasty, ureterovesical reconstruction and in the management of stone disease (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finney-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finney 1978</LINK>). The therapeutic benefits of stents in transplantation are still disputed but may include simplifying the creation of a watertight ureteric to bladder anastomosis and reduction of anatomical kinking (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK>). The most significant theoretical complication is an increase in the number and severity of urinary tract infections (UTI). Other possible complications include persistent haematuria and bladder discomfort, stent migration, breakage, encrustation and complications during removal.</P>
<P>A number of centres have adopted a policy of prophylactic stent insertion with endoscopic removal at a designated time post-transplantation in an effort to reduce the MUCs rate (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1993</LINK>). However, it has been suggested that a tension-free anastomosis with an intact blood supply is the only effective strategy to avoid both early and late ureteric complications, and the benefits of prophylactic stenting are outweighed by their possible complications. As a consequence many units continue to selectively stent only difficult anastomoses or in circumstances where the vesicoureteric viability may be additionally compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Thomalla-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomalla 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>The review was carried out initially by three authors (CHW, AAB, DMM, DAR) and a fourth (DAR) was consulted for a specific urological transplant opinion. The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may have been relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by CHW and AAB who discarded studies that were not applicable. Both primary authors independently assessed the retrieved abstracts and determined which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was carried out by the same authors independently using standard data extraction forms. Further information required from the original author was requested by written correspondence and relevant information obtained in this manner has been included in the review. The inclusion of studies was then discussed and agreed with the third and fourth authors (DMM and DAR).</P>

Absolute risk reductions are given as numbers needed to treat (NNT), a figure that quantifies the number of patients that must be stented to prevent one MUCs. Data was pooled using the random effects model but the fixed effects model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen, susceptibility to outliers and during sub group analysis. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi squared test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with a P value of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I² values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity. When statistical heterogeneity was present subgroup analysis was to be used to explore possible sources. Adverse effects were collated and reported in tabular form.</P>

<P>As expected none of the studies attempted to blind patient, investigator or assessor to treatment allocation. Overall the studies were of low or medium quality, however four of the RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK>) detailed a robust method of randomisation which would be unaffected by physician pre-conceptions. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>) was designed with a treatment group randomised to receive stents universally and one arm receiving stents if the senior surgeon present deemed them necessary, a policy commonly termed "selective" stenting. For two studies the randomisation method was unclear from the paper and the authors did not respond to attempts at clarification (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK> presented their results censored for either graft loss or patient death unrelated to urological complications or stents, during our meta-analysis these results were adjusted to include the patients as originally randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK> randomised patients to four groups: L-G or L-P with or without stent. These results were summated into "with" and "without stent" groups. Only <LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK> detailed a loss to follow-up before three months.</P>
<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria of each study were difficult to assess. Only one study investigator (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>) reported patients assessed, enrolled or withdrawn prior to randomisation in keeping with modern CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2004</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK>) specifically excluded kidneys and recipients with abnormal urinary tracts. One study included multi-visceral recipients (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>) and in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK>) the kidneys were only live donor derived. Paediatric recipients were specifically excluded by <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK> whilst in other studies the protocol was unclear. No study reported results on our specific exclusion criteria recipients. The intervention period in <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK> was only seven to 10 days, out with our protocol stated minimum period of 14 days.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK> stated that the operations reported on were consecutive and detailed no exclusions. None of these authors responded to attempts to contact and the inclusion/ exclusion criteria from their protocols could not be confirmed.</P>
<P>In summary, the study designs were heterogeneous with disparate donors, intervention periods, outcome assessments and statistical analysis, however common themes of randomisation and control <I>were</I> present in all studies and the primary research question of each study followed the principle of this review. After consultation between all four reviewers, we decided to include all the studies in this meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Urine leak and obstruction</HEADING>
<P>The MUCs (leak and/or stenosis) incidence ranged between 0 and 4 % in stented patients (median 1.0%) and between 0 and 17.3% (median 7.0 %) in the non-stented patients (additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Incidence of major urological complications (MUCs)</I>) There were significantly fewer events in the stent group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.77, P = 0.02; NNT 13). This treatment effect appeared uniform for both complications, with urine leak (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2: RR 0.29, 0.12 to 0.74, P = 0.009) and ureteric stenosis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.3: RR 0.27, 0.09 to 0.81, P = 0.02) similarly reduced.</P>
<P>As was to be expected with considerable differences in the clinical interventions, diagnostic techniques and donors there was a level of statistical heterogeneity in these outcomes; although this did not reach significance (&#967;² = 11.48, P = 0.07, I² = 48%).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>The most substantial finding during subgroup analysis was the influence of surgeon experience on outcome. In studies where only a single experienced surgeon performed or supervised all the operations, the incidence of MUCs in the control group was lower (median 6.3 % versus 10.3% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1 same surgeon: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.86; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.2 many surgeons: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> - <I>Influence of surgeon number on incidence of MUCs</I>) and hence the benefit of stent placement was lower (NNT 30 versus 10).</P>
<P>Of the two studies in which both LP and LG techniques were utilised, only <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK> reported results on LP procedures separately and showed a significantly greater incidence of MUCs in the unstented LP group, and a concomitantly larger risk reduction with the use of stents. No significant influence of the donor organ type (cadaveric, live, multiorgan) or stent type could be identified in this small number of studies. Similarly we could not identify a correlation with the length of stent placement and the incidence of MUCs.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK> (stenting versus selective stenting), six (4.4%) patients in the control group received a prophylactic stent. Despite this, there were more MUCs in the control group than the stent group. Three studies specifically reported better graft function or less MUCs whilst the stent was <I>in situ</I>. <LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK> reported no MUCs in the first two weeks post-transplant in the stented group versus two in the non-stented group. <LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK> showed a significant difference in kidney function early post-transplant (mean serum creatinine at one week 302 µmol/L versus 388 µmol/L ) and <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK> reported no MUCs within 20 days in the group that had been stented, whilst all the patients with MUCs in the non-stented group presented within 13 days.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient and graft survival</HEADING>
<P>(<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> - <I>Graft loss and patient mortality</I>)</P>
<P>No studies directly attributed patient mortality to the use of ureteric stents. <LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK> reported graft loss secondary to use of ureteric stents: two kidneys had to be removed after stent encrustation with corynebacterium could not be eradicated with antibiotics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">UTI</HEADING>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity in definitions, reported morbidity and relative incidence of UTI. Meta-analysis identified a significant increase in UTI associated with stents (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>: RR 1.49 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15, P = 0.03) with significant statistical heterogeneity (Chi² = 15.32, P = 0.02, I² = 60.8%). This statistic was independent of the diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), with an equivalent RR reported between studies diagnosing infection on the basis of culture alone (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.1: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.45) and studies requiring clinical symptoms for confirmation of infection (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.90). Subgroup analysis identified the risk to be associated with the antibiotic regime (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Studies detailing prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK> excluded) with long-term cotrimoxazole 480 mg/d (or 960 mg alternate days) had an equivalent RR for infection between stented and non-stented patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.1: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.33) compared with other regimes <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.2: RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.21). The cotrimoxazole regime detailed by <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK> included only three doses of cotrimoxazole 480 mg/wk.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Haematuria</HEADING>
<P>Graft implantation requires bladder incision and there will always be a level of haematuria after kidney transplantation. As a symptom or clinical finding, haematuria was sporadically reported by investigators and definitions varied widely (additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> - <I>Incidence of haematuria)</I>. Two studies reported cases of ureteric clot retention (<LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>) and only three studies gave specific definitions for haematuria (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK>). Of the three studies that gave figures for haematuria, two studies reported more morbidity in the stented group and one the non-stented group. There was no evidence in the six studies that the presence of a stent <I>per se</I> pre-disposed to recurrent or severe haematuria <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.48).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other complications</HEADING>
<P>(<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> - <I>Other stent-related complications</I>)</P>
<P>The most significant complications reported were the two graft losses by <LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK>. Only two stent breakages were reported, both in patients receiving simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants with bladder exocrine drainage. Encrustation appeared to be a significant problem for stents left in for longer periods (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK>), although this statistic was not reported in the original paper from <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK>. The highest rate of stent migration and expulsion was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK> who used the longest (24 cm) stent. Cases of "forgotten" stents were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK>, none of these cases was associated with excess morbidity. Stents appeared well tolerated whilst <I>in situ</I> with only two studies reporting an excess of irritative symptoms and pain not associated with infection (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK>). No studies reported complications from routine removal or secondary obstruction from encrustation.</P>
<P>In summary the maximum reported non-infectious complications were irritative symptoms 5.6% (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>), breakage 2.0% (<LINK REF="STD-Benoit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Benoit 1996</LINK>), migration/malposition/expulsion 7.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>), encrustation/urolithiasis 5.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>) and "forgotten" stents 7% (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1998</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 18:16:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>MUCs require interventions varying in severity from a radiological nephrostomy through to surgical urinary diversion. Consequently any intervention which can safely and cost effectively lower their incidence are to be welcomed. Our analysis demonstrates that universal prophylactic ureteric stenting reduces the incidence of MUCs significantly (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.77).</P>
<P>A recent review and meta-analysis included only five of the RCTs (796 patients) and reported a similar treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Mangus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangus 2004</LINK>). However, there is a significant "caveat" to these conclusions. RCTs with unblinded treatment allocation have been acknowledged to overestimate the beneficial effects of medical interventions by up to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Such an overestimate would comprehensively negate the treatment effect described here. Of the studies included, <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2000</LINK>, which had a shorter intervention period than our protocol originally allowed and compared universal stenting with selective stenting, would be expected to show the least evidence of effect. This was not born out by his results. It was slightly surprising therefore that despite six of the seven studies showing a reduction in the MUCs incidence, only three of the seven studies recommended universal prophylactic stenting.</P>
<P>One explanation for this may be an "experience" effect. The four studies with a single senior author performing or supervising all the operations had a lower complication rate in the control group when compared with studies where more than one surgical team performed the operations. This has been suggested previously and may explain the conclusions of senior study investigators, cognisant of their considerable personal experience, extolling a policy of selective stenting (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were unable to identify a particular stent design associated with a better outcome as a wide variety of stent designs, calibres and lengths were used. Non-infectious adverse events appeared more common in studies using longer stents (<LINK REF="STD-Guleria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guleria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2004</LINK>) and or longer treatment periods (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pleass-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pleass 1995</LINK>), although there was no evidence that haematuria was more common. These idiosyncratic stent-related complications were mostly managed by endoscopic removal of the stent - a minimally invasive procedure - which was unavoidable after initial stent placement and has been successfully combined with other necessary interventions for transplant recipients (e.g. peritoneal and haemodialysis catheter removal). Irritative symptoms and stent-related pain were much less frequent than would be expected from studies examining the use of stents in native ureters after general urological procedures where the incidence may be as high as 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Joshi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK> has suggested that the combination of a denervated kidney and the high anterior placement of the stent reduce the combination of vesicoureteric reflux pain and trigonal irritation. However, none of the studies specifically used a validated questionnaire to quantify the urinary symptoms or bother associating with either stent usage or removal and this may well be an underestimate of the morbidity burden.</P>
<P>Two grafts were lost as a result of stent related infectious complications and the pooled results indicated a general increased risk of UTI with their use (RR 1.49, 05% CI 1.04 to 2.15). Cotrimoxazole, at a dose of 480 mg/d or 960 mg every other day, is standard therapy in most units and recommended in published guidelines for all kidney transplant recipients as prophylaxis against <I>Pneumocystis carinii</I> pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2002</LINK>). Our subgroup analysis data also suggests this regime is effective at reducing the incidence of UTI to levels found in unstented transplant urinary tracts (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.33). It should be emphasised that this statistic, in common with all the analyses, is based on a small number of studies and open to reporting error.</P>
<P>Only one study reported a cost-benefit analysis and although the morbidity associated with stents appears minimal and the therapeutic benefit sizeable, there remain unanswered questions with regards to economic and quality of life issues. In this respect a study of selective versus universal stenting, utilising a stent specific quality of life instrument , would not only provide the opportunity for a more realistic cost benefit analysis of universal prophylactic stenting but also demonstrate whether surgeons can identify intra-operatively urinary tracts that need to be stented. Such a study would also need to stratify surgeons by experience to have significant worldwide implications for practice.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-08 17:40:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Routine prophylactic stenting reduces the incidence of MUCs and is to be recommended on the basis of the currently available RCTs. Stents are associated with specific complications and experienced surgeons may adopt a policy of selective stenting, as opposed to universal stenting, to minimise the potential morbidity of stents. Cotrimoxazole, at a dose of 480 mg/d, effectively reduces the risk of UTIs associated with stent placement. Transplant units currently using this antibiotic regime as prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia should not notice an excess of stent related infections.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-08 17:38:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The optimal stent calibre, length, design and duration remain to be determined and further studies addressing these issues could be instituted. Well designed studies of stenting versus selective stenting, with appropriate patient selection protocols, randomisation, quality of life questionnaires, cost-benefit analyses and surgeon stratification would answer the more clinically important question of whether it is possible and desirable to identify the appropriate patients to stent at the time of graft implantation.</P>
