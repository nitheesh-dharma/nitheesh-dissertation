<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-13 12:33:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. It is estimated that 300 million people of all ages, and all ethnic backgrounds, suffer from asthma, with 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide attributed to asthma. In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasm and swelling (inflammation). Corticosteroid drugs can be used to reduce the swelling. Corticosteroids can be inhaled, or taken systemically by mouth (orally) or through a drip into the veins (intravenously).</P>
<P>Standard treatment for asthma attacks is to administer beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (to open up the airways) and systemic corticosteroids (to reduce the inflammation). The purpose of this review was to determine if the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents is beneficial in emergency department treatment settings.<B> </B>A total of 90 studies were identified for this review; 20 were deemed relevant and selected for inclusion (13 paediatric, 7 adult), with a total number of 1403 patients.</P>
<P>This review found that inhaled corticosteroids used alone or in combination with systemic corticosteroids helped to relieve asthma attacks, were well tolerated and had few side effects. However, the most effective drug and dosage are unclear. The studies in the review included a variety of ICSmedications: beclomethasone (Beclovent/Becloforte/QVAR), budesonide (Pulmicort), dexamethasone sodium phosphate, fluticasone propionate (Flovent or Flixotide), Flunisolide (Aerobid) and triamcinolone (Azmacort). The review also found that ICS administered in this setting resulted in fewer hospital admissions. There was a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per hundred patients treated with ICS agents compared with placebo. At this time there is insufficient evidence to support using ICS agents alone as a replacement for systemic corticosteroid therapy in acute asthma attacks</P>
<P>However, there are many unanswered questions about the use of ICS in the emergency department treatment setting. Future research should focus on optimal dosage, dosage frequency and delivery device, identification of effective ICS agents, clearly defined outcomes (such as admissions criteria, pulmonary function testing and follow-up after discharge from emergency departments).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-13 09:57:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:03:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) statistics.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:04:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>: MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:05:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:06:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute asthma exacerbation is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED). In the US, acute asthma exacerbations account for almost two million ED visits per year (<LINK REF="REF-Mannino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 1998</LINK>). Approximately 10% to 20% of these patients will require admission to the hospital, and, of those discharged from the ED after apparently successful treatment, approximately 10% to 20% will relapse within two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Griswold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griswold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2010</LINK>).

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-13 11:09:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is general agreement that bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids are first-line agents for acute asthma. Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are used to provide rapid symptom relief, whereas corticosteroids are used to counter airway inflammation and hasten resolution of the asthma exacerbation. There remain numerous controversies regarding the optimal agent, dose, frequency of delivery and route of delivery for both bronchodilators and corticosteroids in the acute setting. Current practice patterns usually include the use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists via a nebuliser or metered-dose inhaled (MDI) and spacer and oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids administered early in the ED treatment of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Griswold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griswold 2005</LINK>). While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used more commonly after ED discharge, their use is uncommon in the ED setting (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:07:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ICS have the potential to be of benefit in the acute setting. They have been shown to be effective alternatives to oral corticosteroids in long-term asthma therapy, where they can reduce or even eliminate oral corticosteroid requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>). Potential advantages of ICS in acute asthma therapy might include fewer systemic side effects, direct delivery to the airways, and a greater efficacy in reducing airway reactivity and oedema either alone or in addition to systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, ancillary evidence from studies of patients with croup suggests that ICS agents may act on the airways over the short term to improve outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ausejo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ausejo 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-18 14:26:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only a limited number of trials have examined the use of ICS in acute asthma and they have yielded inconsistent results. The previous version of this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>) concluded that "inhaled steroids reduced hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that ICS alone is as effective as systemic corticosteroid. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to systemic corticosteroid." The 2012 update of the review evaluated these conclusions in relation to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published since the publication of the previous version of the review.</P>
<P>Separate reviews are available in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> for: increased versus stable doses of ICS for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Quon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quon 2010</LINK>), early ED treatment of acute asthma with systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2008</LINK>) and ICS for acute asthma following ED discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for further details). We searched all records in the CAGR coded as 'asthma'. For the review version up to 2005 we used the search strategy in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, while for the 2012 update, we used the strategy described in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.

<P>We planned to evaluate publication bias using visual inspection of funnel plots if there was an adequate number of trials aggregated in the analyses (more than 10). However, we recognised that an asymmetric funnel plot can reflect heterogeneity, outcome reporting bias and small study effects and is therefore not necessarily a reflection of publication bias. A sufficient number of trials in the analysis provided the opportunity to include funnel plots for the primary analyses, and they are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and Figure 2.</P>

<P>The initial search in 1998 identified 352 articles. There were a total of 187 original citations; 15 articles were deemed potentially relevant by one or both of the two review authors, with substantial agreement (kappa = 0.78) between the two review authors. These 15 articles were retrieved and the full-text manuscripts were reviewed for inclusion. From the full text, using specific criteria, two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Five articles were identified by both review authors for inclusion, with 100% simple agreement and a kappa of 1.0. Six further articles were identified using other methods (one by author contact, two by searching abstracts from recent meetings and three in the updates from the register or computerised searches), which were selected for inclusion for a total of 11 articles; seven in the primary analysis and four in the secondary analysis.</P>
<P>In the update search in April 1999 we identified 42 articles with 33 original citations. One of these articles was selected for inclusion in the secondary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>). In an update search in February 2001 using EMBASE and MEDLINE, two further trials were selected for inclusion, one in the primary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1999</LINK>), and one in the secondary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Devidayal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Devidayal 1999</LINK>). One further article was added from searching abstracts for inclusion in the secondary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Schuh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuh 2000</LINK>). An update search in April 2002 identified one further trial for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2001</LINK>). An update search in February 2003 did not find any new studies for inclusion.</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Milani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 2004</LINK>) had three treatment arms (ICS, systemic corticosteroid and placebo) and so contributed to both the primary and secondary analyses.

<P>ICS were administered early in the course of ED treatment; usually at the time of the first beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment. Total doses ranged from low (BDP 200 &#956;g; <LINK REF="STD-Pansegrouw-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pansegrouw 1992</LINK>) to very high (flunisolide 18 mg; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1998</LINK>). The route of administration was via nebuliser or MDI with spacer in the paediatric studies, and predominantly via MDI with spacer in all the adult studies. In the analysis of ICS versus systemic corticosteroid, the doses of ICS were generally moderate to high. The dose, frequency and agents used in this review varied widely; however, there appears to be evidence of effect despite this heterogeneity. For example, various ICS agents were used (budesonide most often {14 studies}), the median single dose was 900 µg, the median frequency of treatment was 2 activations, and the median cumulative dose was 2 mg over up to 6 hours of observation. Delivery was most commonly by nebuliser or MDI with spacer.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes were measured at different time points. Most trials included pulmonary function tests or a clinical score (in paediatric studies), and hospital admissions. The criteria for admission, and the timing of admission decisions, varied among the trials, with only one trial reporting pre-specified admission criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1999</LINK>). Reporting of symptom scores and adverse effects also were variable, and further information about adverse effects had to be provided by authors. Vital signs were reported frequently or were requested from the authors in the initial version of this review, when not reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Admission to hospital</HEADING>
<P>Admission to hospital is reported in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and indicates a significant reduction in hospital admissions in patients treated with ICS (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; N = 960) and the heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%) was modest. Closer inspection of <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> reveals that both subgroups - ICS plus systemic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433) and ICS versus placebo (OR 0.27; 95% 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527) - indicate benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). However, there was heterogeneity within the subgroup of trials using ICS plus systemic corticosteroids (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%), and using a random effects model the confidence interval widens to OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.88). The two newest trials showed divergent results, but <LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK> is not yet fully reported. The large reduction in hospital admissions found in <LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK> contrasts with <LINK REF="STD-Upham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Upham 2011</LINK>, the most recent fully reported study, which did not find a reduction in hospital admissions. The distribution of these effects is shown in the funnel plot in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Three additional randomised studies were identified that we could not include in the meta-analysis (as the number of participants in each group with the outcome were not reported). A summary of the results is included below to ensure that they are available to provide context for the above data. In <LINK REF="STD-Bautista-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bautista 1994</LINK> (30 children) hospital admissions were reported as 13% in the budesonide plus beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist group whereas in the group receiving beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone it was 73% and is therefore consistent with the effect observed in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK> "treatment failure" was reported, which was defined as the need for additional asthma treatment or hospitalisation. The data for hospitalisations could not be extracted separately but treatment failure was reported in 10% of those receiving ICS and 16% of those receiving placebo, in keeping with the findings of the included studies. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Olaivar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olaivar 1999</LINK>, a low dose of budesonide was compared to placebo, with both groups receiving beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, and they found no difference in the number of "good responders" between the groups.</P>

<P>Pooled results showed a benefit of ICS therapy on % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at two and four hours post treatment (two hours MD 3.81; 95% CI 0.28 to 7.33; 4 studies; N = 319; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; four hour MD 5.93; 95% CI 2.11 to 9.75; 4 studies; N = 319; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>), without significant visual or statistical heterogeneity (two hours: I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; four hours: I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 23%). There was a trend towards benefit at one hour that was not statistically significant. At six hours post treatment, there was no significant difference between the treatments; the largest study with the most marked benefit of ICS therapy followed patients for only three hours so did not contribute to the six-hour analyses. Analysis of absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> showed no statistically significant difference between treatments but there was marked heterogeneity. This was most marked at one hour (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 90%). Despite adjusting for the baseline difference in the trial with the largest difference, significant heterogeneity remained. This heterogeneity was also present at two-hour (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 61%) and 3- to 4-hour analyses (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 65%).</P>
<P>In the analyses of % predicted PEF, there was a small, statistically significant benefit of ICS therapy at both one and two hours (one hour MD 5.66; 95% CI 2.01 to 9.32; 4 studies; N = 324; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>; two hour MD 7.46; 95% CI 3.77 to 11.15; 5 studies; N = 384; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).

In <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK> (115 patients) data were reported for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> with respect to change from baseline (whereas the analyses in this review focus on absolute levels at fixed time points or in terms of % predicted) and there were no significant differences between the two groups (budesonide/formoterol versus formoterol alone). <LINK REF="STD-Estrada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Estrada 2005</LINK> (100 children) similarly reported no significant difference in improvement between fluticasone plus salbutamol versus salbutamol alone; <LINK REF="STD-Olaivar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olaivar 1999</LINK> (65 children) also reported no significant difference between budesonide and placebo in change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. <LINK REF="STD-Sekerel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sekerel 2005</LINK> (67 children) reported levels of improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> from baseline for the treatment and control groups, and the difference between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.24). The randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Blandon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blandon 2004</LINK> (86 children) reported no significant differences between the two groups (nebulised budesonide plus albuterol versus albuterol alone) in terms of improvement in PEF; as these data reflect change in PEF rather than absolute values they were not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>However, three further studies reporting change in PEF scores have reported an advantage for ICS. <LINK REF="STD-Bautista-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bautista 1994</LINK> (30 children) reported "budesonide + beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist improves the PEF (49.1 to 173) and Pulmonary Index Score at 1 hour (P &lt; 0.05) compared with those given beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone (41.6 to 77.5) with no untoward drug reactions among the subjects in the combination group". <LINK REF="STD-Nuhoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhoglu 2005</LINK> (26 children) reported a significant difference between budesonide versus placebo (with both groups receiving parenteral methylprednisolone) with regard to their baseline/one hour after treatment change in PEF (P = 0.0155); however, it should be noted that there was considerable difference between the two groups in baseline mean PEF L/min (150.00 ± 32.19 SD in the budesonide group and 192.86 ± 58.63 SD in the placebo arm). <LINK REF="STD-Starobin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Starobin 2008</LINK> (49 adult patients) also found that with respect to the before and after ED treatment percentage of PEF improvement in a comparison between fluticasone plus methylprednisolone versus methylprednisolone alone there was a significantly superior improvement with the combined intervention (MD 4.4; 95% CI 1.74 to 7.06).</P>
<P>It is therefore difficult to provide a clear overall conclusion with respect to pulmonary function data considering trials that cannot be incorporated into the meta-analysis. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blandon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blandon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Estrada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Estrada 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olaivar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olaivar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sekerel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sekerel 2005</LINK>) (433 patients in total) report no significant advantage, whereas three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bautista-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bautista 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhoglu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Starobin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Starobin 2008</LINK>) (105 patients in total) report additional benefit with ICS.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical scores</HEADING>
<P>A range of different clinical scores, including the pulmonary index, PIS and other novel scores (including combinations of measures of accessory muscle use, respiratory rate, wheezing, retractions, dyspnoea and oxygen saturation) were combined using an SMD technique and random-effects model. At three to four hours there was a modest, statistically significant difference favouring ICS (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.62; 4 studies; N = 198; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>), with no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>However at an earlier time point (one to two hours) there appeared to be no benefit from ICS with regard to clinical scores (SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.07; 4 studies; N = 176; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>)</P>
<P>Three additional studies were identified that were relevant to this outcome but reported change scores that could not be included in the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK> (100 children) observed a significant improvement in PIS<B> </B>with regard to change from baseline<B> </B>to 120 minutes<B> </B>between budesonide versus placebo (P = 0.026). <LINK REF="STD-Upham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Upham 2011</LINK> (179 children) reported no difference between budesonide and placebo with respect to change in asthma scores from baseline and two hours (P = 0.64). <LINK REF="STD-Starobin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Starobin 2008</LINK> (49 adult patients) reported a dyspnoea score (baseline dyspnoea index), which was scored from 0 (no dyspnoea) to 3 (severe dyspnoea), and did not find a difference between the group receiving fluticasone plus IV methylprednisolone versus the group receiving IV methylprednisolone alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vital signs</HEADING>
<P>Data for heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure were pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to oxygen saturation (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.66 to 0.31; 5 studies; N = 301). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in respiratory rate (MD 0.57; 95% CI -1.69 to 2.83; 3 studies; N = 198) and systolic blood pressure (MD -0.32; 95% CI -6.00 to 5.36; 3 studies; N = 128). However, there was a small difference with respect to heart rate, with a higher level in the group treated with ICS (MD 3.99; 95% CI 0.59 to 7.39; 5 studies; N = 363)</P>
<P>Four additional randomised studies were identified that we could not include in the meta-analyses; the results are included below to provide context for the above data. In <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK> (115 patients) data were reported in insufficient detail to be accommodated in the meta-analyses for vital signs, electrocardiograph (ECG) parameters, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. There were no significant differences between the two groups apart from with respect to heart rate where a lower maximum value was observed in the budesonide group (P = 0.026), but the absolute difference was small (91.6 versus 94.3 beats per minute). With regard to SaO<SUB>2</SUB> levels, <LINK REF="STD-Estrada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Estrada 2005</LINK> (100 children) reported no significant difference between fluticasone plus salbutamol versus salbutamol alone and <LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK> (100 children) observed no significant difference in SaO<SUB>2</SUB> levels<B> </B>between budesonide versus placebo; these data were not reported in sufficient detail to be included in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Upham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Upham 2011</LINK> (180 children) reported no significant difference between budesonide and placebo with respect to change in respiratory rate, heart rate or SaO<SUB>2</SUB> levels from baseline and two hours; the data were reported as medians and interquartile ranges and therefore could not be included in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The narrative inclusion of these additional studies is broadly consistent with the results presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK> with regard to oxygen saturation. In terms of heart rates the finding reported in <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK> is inconsistent with the overall findings reported in <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:36:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review examined the available clinical evidence for the use of ICS in the ED management of acute asthma. The primary meta-analysis was based on 20 studies that included 1403 patients. The pooled results showed a beneficial effect of ICS therapy compared to placebo in preventing hospital admission, with a significant (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62) reduction in admission following the administration of ICS in the ED. Given a hospital admission level of 32% in the placebo group, approximately eight patients would require ICS treatment to prevent one admission (95% CI 6 to 14) The review shows a beneficial effect of ICS versus placebo in preventing hospital admission even in the studies where systemic corticosteroid was administered to all patients as standard therapy; however,disparate results from the new studies added in the 2012 update for this subgroup have contributed to increased heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Only a small number of trials reported data on pulmonary function tests in a manner that could be included in the meta-analysis; however, the effects of ICS on measurement of lung function found in the review were small. The minimum difference in pulmonary function tests that is considered clinically significant has been widely debated. This value remains unclear, not identified through empirical studies, and much of this research is based on stable asthma. However, a minimum improvement of 10% to 12% in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, or approximately 30 L/minute in PEF (<LINK REF="REF-Karras-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karras 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiffany 1993</LINK>), is likely to be necessary to demonstrate an important clinical difference. Based on these guidelines, the improvement of 6% in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at three to four hours, or 7% in the PEF would be of questionable clinical importance. There was heterogeneity in the results of the absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and PEF. This may have been due to baseline differences in pulmonary function tests between the groups, which were statistically and clinically significant. Other possible causes include differences in the populations, interventions, designs and methods of measuring the pulmonary function tests. However, the small number of studies did not permit meaningful analysis of these differences.</P>
<P>The pulmonary index (a clinical score) has been shown to correlate with pulmonary function test results including FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC and FEV<SUB>25-75%</SUB>, and with hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1984</LINK>). Five of the trials used clinical scores that were quite similar to the pulmonary index and reported them in a manner they could be included in the review. A modest, statistically significant improvement in clinical score between the groups was demonstrated at three to four hours (SMD -0.33; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.05). This difference would represent an insignificant clinical change for most patients. For example, from the cited studies, this would represent an improvement from 0.1 points in clinical index (<LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1998</LINK>) to 0.8 (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1998</LINK>) in the PIS. Moreover, in view of the use of an SMD measure to combine different scores, and the small magnitude of the difference, this result and any conclusions based on it should be viewed with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:32:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very few adverse effects of ICS therapy were reported in any of the studies, and this was confirmed with corresponding authors. Most importantly, no increase in cough or bronchospasm, occasionally attributed to ICS therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Passalacqua-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passalacqua 2000</LINK>), was observed. The lack of effect on vital signs also supports the safety of ICS therapy.</P>
<P>Twelve of the twenty published trials did not show a beneficial effect of ICS on the primary outcome of the trial. Nonetheless, the possibility of publication bias in favour of ICS remains. However, a comprehensive search strategy was conducted using a systematic strategy. Attempts to find unpublished trials were also made, including extensive correspondence with the authors of the studies included in the 2003 review as well as other experts in the field, searching of abstracts from recent conferences and contact with the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ICS. Four unpublished trials were identified and included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bautista-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bautista 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blandon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blandon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olaivar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olaivar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK>); although we were only successful in contacting one of the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Razi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Razi 2012</LINK>). While the results of the unpublished studies appear consistent with those of the published studies, many of the details of these studies are missing. One of these studies comparing ICS versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bautista-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bautista 1994</LINK>) reported a significantly decreased number of hospital admissions and improved pulmonary function tests in the group treated with ICS, while one abstract stated that the group treated with ICS had a trend towards improvement in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> that was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Olaivar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olaivar 1999</LINK>). The third study found no significant differences between the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Blandon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blandon 2004</LINK>) in PEF. All of these studies were relatively small, and these results appear consistent with those of the published studies.</P>
<P>Six studies remain in the awaiting assessment section of this review: four of these studies related to the primary analysis. Three have published in abstract form only, and it is unclear whether the patients included in the studies were treated in the ED or after hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2009</LINK>). The one published study was unobtainable (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrosio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrosio 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A secondary analysis was performed including 14 studies where ICS alone was compared to systemic corticosteroid alone. Owing to the diverse outcomes reported in the studies, only hospital admissions were compared (with 10 studies reporting hospital admissions). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies for hospital admissions. The small number of studies, and the small number of outcomes amenable to pooling, precluded further investigation of the sources of the heterogeneity. Pooling of hospital admission data using the random-effects model resulted in an OR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.24). This result does not exclude the possibility of either treatment being significantly better (or worse) than the other. In addition, many of these studies included patients with relatively mild asthma. Two unpublished studies are awaiting assessment for inclusion in the secondary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Acun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Acun 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jerez 2002</LINK>); both were relatively small and did not report significant differences between the treatment groups in the published abstracts in clinical outcomes.</P>

The majority (75%) of trials were at low risk of performance and detection bias while four were assessed as high risk of bias. Overall we felt that the evidence was of moderate quality and the effect that risks of bias had on our confidence in the treatment effects can be seen in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-09-18 11:55:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with most systematic reviews there is a risk of publication bias with regard to the identification of unpublished negative trials, and therefore the effect of ICS therapy may be overestimated and conversely the possibility of failure to identify unpublished positive trials may underestimate the treatment effect. Having said that, the review was based on a comprehensive search with a systematic strategy to minimise the risk of bias. We believe we have identified the majority of the research considering the questions addressed by the review.</P>
<P>We are also conscious of the risk of study selection bias. However, each phase of the review was conducted by two independent review authors, and we feel confident that the studies excluded were assessed against consistent and relevant criteria.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:32:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2012 update provides further support for the findings of the earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>, there was a beneficial effect of ICS compared to placebo when used early in the ED treatment of acute asthma, but it was not conclusive if there was benefit when ICS is used in addition to systemic corticosteroid therapy, which would be considered the standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2011</LINK>). The 2012 update shows a statistically significant benefit of ICS therapy when used in addition to systemic corticosteroid therapy, but there is statistical heterogeneity in this subgroup which may reflect the clinical heterogeneity among the trials . Despite the addition of more studies to the secondary analysis, it remains unclear whether ICS could be used in place of systemic corticosteroid in the ED treatment of acute asthma, as there is marked heterogeneity between the studies that could not be explained on the basis of obvious differences in the study characteristics.</P>
<P>The 2012 update reports additional subgroup analyses comparing the results in adults and children, high and low doses of ICS and nebulised versus MDI and spacer delivery. All of these subgroups now demonstrate significant reductions in hospital admissions and there are no significant differences between the subgroups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-13 10:40:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy alone can be used to replace systemic corticosteroid therapy, therefore systemic corticosteroids should not be withheld from patients with acute asthma presenting to the ED.</LI>
<LI>ICS therapy decreases hospital admissions in patients compared to treatment with placebo, and may be considered in addition to systemic corticosteroid treatment (although the most recent evidence is conflicting).</LI>
<LI>ICS are well tolerated with few short term side effects across a wide variety of doses.</LI>
<LI>ICS appear to decrease hospital admissions to a similar degree in both children and adults</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-13 11:01:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many unanswered questions about the use of ICS in the ED treatment of acute asthma and we believe the following merit further research:</P>
<UL>
<LI>additional studies are required to determine the optimal dose and delivery device, type of ICS and frequency of administration of ICS;</LI>
<LI>studies investigating the effect of ICS based on prior ICS and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use are needed. One study suggested a marked benefit of ICS therapy in patients who had been unresponsive to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in the hours prior to ED presentation (<LINK REF="STD-Pansegrouw-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pansegrouw 1992</LINK>). Further research is needed to confirm the validity of this subgroup;</LI>
<LI>a large randomised controlled trial would be less susceptible to the effect of marked baseline pulmonary function test differences between the treatment groups, which was observed in some of these small studies;</LI>
<LI>future research should focus on clearly defined outcomes, with specific criteria for admission, relapse, timing and type of pulmonary function testing, and length of follow-up in the ED and after discharge.</LI>
