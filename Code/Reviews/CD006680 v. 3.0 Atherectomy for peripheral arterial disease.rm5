<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-17 09:11:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A person with diseased arteries in the legs can experience pain on walking (also known as intermittent claudication), pain at rest (especially at night), or ulcers due to poor blood flow. Established treatments include surgery, where a bypass is inserted to carry blood from an artery above the diseased (blocked or narrowed) section to below the diseased section, and balloon angioplasty, where a deflated balloon is inserted into the vessel and then blown up to stretch the artery thus opening up the narrow or blocked section. Stents may be inserted during angioplasty. In addition to these two established treatments, a less commonly used technique is to core out the artery, cutting or grinding away the disease which is causing the vessel to narrow or block. This is known as atherectomy.</P>
<P>In this review, we compared atherectomy to the more established treatments such as balloon angioplasty and bypass surgery. We identified four studies with a total of 220 participants. All studies compared atherectomy with balloon angioplasty. The studies were of low quality as there was no blinding of the procedures, the studies were not properly powered to show an effect, not all study outcomes were reported and a large number of the initial study populations did not complete the studies.</P>
<P>Although the results of the meta-analyses were imprecise, the average effect of the two treatments was similar in terms of initial success and unobstructed arteries (patency) at six months or 12 months following the procedure. There was a lower risk of death with atherectomy, most likely due to an unexpectedly high number of deaths in the balloon angioplasty group in one of the two trials reporting deaths. Cardiovascular events were not reported in any of the included studies. There was a reduction in the rate of emergency stenting procedures following atherectomy, and balloon inflation pressures were lower following atherectomy. Complications such as formation of clots (embolisation) and tears along the vessels (vessel dissection) were reported in two trials indicating more embolisations in the atherectomy group and more vessel dissections in the angioplasty group but the data could not be combined. The limited data available indicated that there was no clear evidence of a difference between the atherectomy and balloon angioplasty groups for adverse events such as the need for re-intervention due to obstruction of the treated vessel and above-knee amputation. Quality of life and clinical and symptomatic outcomes such as walking distance or symptom relief were not reported in the studies.</P>
<P>We showed that the limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-08 15:53:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing atherectomy and other established treatments were selected for inclusion. All participants had symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-16 10:13:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (GA and CT) screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of the trials. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-16 11:05:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials were included with a total of 220 participants (118 treated with atherectomy, 102 treated with balloon angioplasty) and 259 treated vessels (129 treated with atherectomy, 130 treated with balloon angioplasty). All studies compared atherectomy with angioplasty. No study was properly powered or assessors blinded to the procedures and there was a high risk of selection, attrition, detection and reporting biases.</P>
<P>The estimated risk of success was similar between the treatment modalities although the confidence interval (CI) was compatible with small benefits of either treatment for the initial procedural success rate (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.91, P = 0.82), patency at six months (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66, P = 0.79) and patency at 12 months (Mantel-Haenszel RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90, P = 0.53) following the procedure. The reduction in all-cause mortality with atherectomy was most likely due to an unexpectedly high mortality in the balloon angioplasty group in one of the two trials that reported mortality (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, P = 0.04). Cardiovascular events were not reported in any study. There was a reduction in the rate of bailout stenting following atherectomy (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84, P = 0.01), and balloon inflation pressures were lower following atherectomy (mean difference -2.73 mmHg, 95% CI -3.48 to -1.98, P &lt; 0.00001). Complications such as embolisation and vessel dissection were reported in two trials indicating more embolisations in the atherectomy group and more vessel dissections in the angioplasty group, but the data could not be pooled. From the limited data available, there was no clear evidence of different rates of adverse events between the atherectomy and balloon angioplasty groups for target vessel revascularisation and above-knee amputation. Quality of life and clinical and symptomatic outcomes such as walking distance or symptom relief were not reported in the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-17 09:14:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has identified poor quality evidence to support atherectomy as an alternative to balloon angioplasty in maintaining primary patency at any time interval. There was no evidence for superiority of atherectomy over angioplasty on any outcome, and distal embolisation was not reported in all trials of atherectomy. Properly powered trials are recommended.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-16 10:53:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease may be treated by a number of options including exercise therapy, angioplasty, stenting and bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>). Atherectomy is a competing technique where atheroma is excised by a rotating cutting blade (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2009</LINK>). Due to the risk of vessel perforation, atherectomy tends to be performed only in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, though it may be used in infrapopliteal vessels. While established treatments have a strong evidence base and guidelines for their use (<LINK REF="REF-TASC-II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC II 2007</LINK>), the outcomes for atherectomy are less well understood. Atherectomy has suffered from a relative paucity of published data, which led the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom to publish guidelines in early 2011 suggesting that it should only be used within the context of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-16 10:57:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherectomy is an endovascular procedure for revascularisation where pieces of atherosclerotic plaque are removed in order to increase the luminal diameter of the vessel (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzwalder-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzwalder 2010</LINK>). The procedure is normally performed percutaneously through a 7-French (F) or 8-F sheath unless vessel access is difficult, in which case an arterial cut-down is required. The mechanism used to remove pieces of plaque can involve a variety of techniques but usually involves some kind of rotating cutting blade, often together with a chamber for storing the cut pieces.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-16 10:59:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A true systematic review and meta-analysis of published trials comparing atherectomy to more established treatments has never been performed. Therefore, the aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing atherectomy with any established treatment for peripheral arterial disease in order to evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy.</P>

<P>As the devices used for atherectomy were different in the included trials, analysis was performed using both Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect models and inverse-variance random-effects models (<LINK REF="REF-Dersimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dersimonian 1986</LINK>), and the sensitivity of the analysis to the use of these two methods was assessed.

<P>Many participants in the atherectomy arm of the included studies underwent additional angioplasty.

The result from atherectomy is still considered successful even with additional angioplasty, so these participants were included in the atherectomy arm for analysis. Only one trial did not perform routine angioplasty with atherectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK>) and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of including this study in the overall meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Four studies met the selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK>). Primary patencies were reported initially in all studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK>). Follow-up was reported at three month intervals in <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK> up until two years. <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK> reported patencies at six months follow-up only. <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK> reported follow-up patencies at 12 months only. <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK> reported follow-up at three months, six months and 12 months. A total of 220 participants (118 atherectomy, 102 angioplasty) were treated in these trials. Some trials treated multiple vessels in each participant, so in total 259 vessels (129 atherectomy, 130 angioplasty) were treated in these trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) also reported rates of bailout stenting and amputation. This bailout stenting was said to be indicated in the presence of severe dissection, perforation, &gt; 30% residual stenosis or significant vessel recoil in one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) but only indicated in the presence of severe dissection or &gt; 30% residual stenosis in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK> compared balloon angioplasty to transluminal extraction catheter (TEC) atherectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Stack-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stack 1988</LINK>) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty in 39 participants with intermittent claudication. TEC atherectomy utilises an over the wire device with a conical motorised cutting head with triangular blades which rotate at 700 rpm, together with a proximal suction apparatus which removes excised plaque. The assembly is controlled by a large hand-held controller which incorporates the motor, triggers to activate the motor and suction, and a sliding advancement control. There was no difference in primary patency either initially (P = 0.16) or at six months (P = 0.16). No medication protocol was specified.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK> compared balloon angioplasty to Simpson atherectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1988</LINK>) in 73 participants with intermittent claudication. The Simpson atherectomy device consists of cylindrical housing with a longitudinal opening down one side and a balloon on the other side. The device is passed over a guide wire to the region of stenosis and then the balloon is inflated in order to both fix the device in place and press the longitudinal opening up against the wall of the vessel. A rotating cutting blade (2000 rpm) is then advanced through the cylinder so that any part of the vessel wall projecting through the longitudinal window will be cut away. These pieces are pushed into a distal collecting chamber, which can hold enough for between four and eight passes of the blade. The balloon is then deflated and the device either repositioned for further passes or removed, and the collecting chamber emptied. There was no difference in primary patency between groups at any time point (log rank P = 0.07). The day before the procedure, all participants were commenced on low dose aspirin therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK> compared balloon angioplasty to Silverhawk atherectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Zeller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeller 2004</LINK>) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty in 58 participants with claudication, rest pain or minor tissue loss. The Silverhawk atherectomy device is similar to the Simpson device, described above, except that instead of using a balloon to push the cutting window against the wall of the vessel the cylindrical housing is hinged in the region of the window, with the device flexing away from the window causing the tip and tail of the device to press up against one side of the vessel wall while the window is pressed up against the other side. The remainder of the procedure is similar. There was no difference in primary patency either initially or at 12 months, but bailout stenting was performed significantly less often following atherectomy (P = 0.01). One participant in the balloon angioplasty arm required an amputation. In this trial, a distal embolism filter was used in approximately half of the participants. This filter caught macroembolic material significantly more frequently following atherectomy than following balloon angioplasty (P = 0.001). If participants were not already established on dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), they were given loading doses of aspirin and clopidogrel immediately prior to the procedure. Participants on established therapy continued on their regular doses.</P>
<P>The final included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) compared balloon angioplasty to Diamondback atherectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Heuser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuser 2008</LINK>) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty in 50 participants with rest pain or tissue loss and stenosed, calcified vessels. Rather than cutting plaque away from the vessel wall, the Diamondback atherectomy device incorporates an eccentrically mounted abrasive crown on a catheter that rotates at high speed (100,000 rpm) causing plaque to be filed rather than cut away. As a result, individual pieces of plaque are likely to be extremely small, so no system for removing the resulting debris is used. There was no difference in primary patency at any time point (log rank test P = 0.14) or rates of bailout stenting (P = 0.44). There were no device or procedure related above-knee amputations in either group. Unexpectedly, 6/25 participants in the balloon angioplasty had died by the 12 month follow-up point, though no good explanation of this could be found by the trialists. No participants in the atherectomy arm died. No medication protocol was specified.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-16 12:13:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main finding from the four RCTs identified was that there was no primary patency benefit to atherectomy over balloon angioplasty. There was a statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality, likely to be caused by an unexpectedly high mortality in the angioplasty arm of one of the two trials reporting mortality. Cardiovascular events were not reported in any of the trials. There was a reduction in the need for bailout stenting associated with a reduction in the inflation pressure necessary to achieve an optimal balloon inflation. Complications such as embolisation and vessel dissection were reported in two trials, indicating more embolisations in the atherectomy group and more vessel dissections in the angioplasty group, but the data could not be pooled. No statistically significant differences were found between the atherectomy and balloon angioplasty groups for adverse events, such as data on target vessel revascularisation and above-knee amputation, but the data were limited. Quality of life and clinical and symptomatic outcomes such as walking distance or symptom relief were not reported in the studies. The trials were not adequately powered, had low participant numbers and poor overall quality relating to blinding and poor reporting of outcomes resulting in high risks of bias.</P>

<P>This represents the only meta-analysis of atherectomy versus any other therapy for peripheral arterial disease to date.</P>
<P>The indication for intervention was claudication in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK>); claudication, rest pain or tissue loss in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>); and rest pain or tissue loss only in the final study (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>). Results of angioplasty and bypass surgery are known to vary between these patient groups (<LINK REF="REF-TASC-II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC II 2007</LINK>) and therefore may bias the results between studies. The severity of claudication was impossible to assess in some included studies, which may mean that the results are for patient groups treated conservatively in many UK centres (<LINK REF="REF-Frans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frans 2012</LINK>), so the results should be interpreted with a degree of caution. Unfortunately we were not able to separate results by symptoms (claudication or critical ischaemia) because of the way study results were reported. In addition, the majority of included studies did not report on all of the pre-specified outcomes of this review, so the results of this review are based in most cases on results from only one or two studies.</P>

<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>) showed power calculations to assess the required number of participants. Overall study numbers were low and meta-analysis of such small participant number randomised trials can be unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2010</LINK>). As a result, the lack of difference in primary patency that was found could easily be type II error. Medication protocols were not stated in two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>). This may be important as it is known that antiplatelet, cilostazol, and heparin use are all associated with lower restenosis rates after angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2012</LINK>). Important clinical endpoints such as secondary patency, limb survival, and complication rates between techniques were not included in all trials to analyse in detail.</P>
<P>Several factors may contribute to heterogeneity between studies even though from the forest plots this was non-significant. One included study compared atherectomy alone with balloon angioplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK>), whereas the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) compared atherectomy plus adjunctive balloon angioplasty with balloon angioplasty alone. Superficially this creates concern about heterogeneity, however three participants in the atherectomy arm of <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK> crossed over and had subsequent balloon angioplasty after failure of atherectomy alone. Additionally, balloon pressures reported in two of the other studies following atherectomy were usually very low, so it is likely that these interventions were more similar than they might appear. Sensitivity analysis excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1995</LINK> study did not change the statistical significance of the results.</P>
<P>One concern with atherectomy devices is the risk of distal embolisation, since the devices physically cut or grind plaques (<LINK REF="REF-Briguori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briguori 2003</LINK>). In one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>) this was found to be a particular issue and a distal embolic filter was deployed in 17/29 of participants, which caught macroembolic debris (defined as debris greater than 2 mm in the longest axis) in 11/17 cases. The filter was deployed in 10/29 of the participants in the balloon angioplasty arm but did not catch macroemboli in any cases. In addition, one participant in the atherectomy arm who was treated without a filter had a clinically significant distal embolic event. In contrast, only one other case of distal embolisation was reported in the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>: one participant in the balloon angioplasty arm had a clinically significant embolic event). As no other studies reported rates of distal embolic filter deployment or macroembolisation, this could not be analysed but remains a specific concern.</P>
<P>Mortality is commonly reported in trials of lower limb revascularisation, which is why it was considered a primary outcome measure. However, the mortality from angioplasty is much lower than is primary patency or limb loss rates (<LINK REF="REF-Laird-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laird 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schillinger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillinger 2006</LINK>), so trials would not be expected to show a difference if powered to detect primary patency. The results presented may be a consequence of random error due to small sample sizes. There was a statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality that was likely to be caused by an unexpectedly high mortality in the angioplasty arm of one of the two trials reporting all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>The poor overall quality of the included trials is a major limitation of this review. A lack of power calculations, protocol uniformity and heterogeneity between trials means that the conclusions that can be drawn from the analyses are limited. However, what is clear from this review is that there is currently no evidence to support the use of atherectomy as a treatment for peripheral vascular disease.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-02-16 12:32:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review process identified only four small trials, so it is difficult to assess the impact of reporting bias. Given the general trend towards the publication of positive findings, especially in the context of new technologies, it is possible that the analysis actually overestimates the benefits of atherectomy over the more established balloon angioplasty.</P>
<P>Some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) treated more than one vessel per participant or limb. Failure of patency of any of the treated vessels increases the chances that other treated vessels will cease to be patent, so these observations will be correlated. It is possible, therefore, that the outcomes of these trials are given greater weight in the meta-analysis than is appropriate in the analysis of six month and 12 month patency. As both the angioplasty and atherectomy arms of these trials included multiple vessels per participant it is unlikely that the magnitude of the observed effect has been affected significantly, though our degree of confidence in this effect may be overstated.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-02-16 12:42:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While there were no previous meta-analyses of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease, atherectomy has been more thoroughly investigated in the coronary arteries. A large meta-analysis comparing multiple randomised trials of atherectomy or other plaque debulking procedures with balloon angioplasty in percutaneous coronary intervention showed no benefit for atherectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bittl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittl 2004</LINK>). The studies in the analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Bittl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittl 2004</LINK> were almost all performed in the 1990s, when coronary stenting was still evolving. A meta-analysis of trials comparing coronary stenting with atherectomy followed by stenting has shown that debulking procedures may indeed confer long-term benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Niccoli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niccoli 2006</LINK>). However, the majority of trials that were analysed were small case-control studies rather than RCTs, and the one large RCT that was analysed failed to show benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Stankovic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankovic 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Balloon angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease is widely practised, has a clear evidence base and is constantly evolving, with the use of covered stents and drug eluting devices, to improve results (<LINK REF="REF-Schillinger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillinger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TASC-II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC II 2007</LINK>). As the technique has evolved so has the evidence base for its place compared to exercise therapy and bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbury-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazari-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazari 2012</LINK>). Based on the results of this review the routine use of atherectomy, against balloon angioplasty, cannot be recommended. Performing a properly powered randomised trial of atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty to look at primary patency or limb survival may be inappropriate considering the lack of difference in this analysis, increased technical difficulty, complication rates and the existing 'gold standard' practice of angioplasty. The exception to this may be in patients with TASC C or D lesions who are not fit for bypass surgery. Atherectomy may offer benefit over the relatively poor results of long segment subintimal angioplasty in this patient group, although results from cohort studies imply that subintimal angioplasty may be superior in this setting (<LINK REF="REF-Indes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indes 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stenting in peripheral arterial disease has been the focus of significant recent attention. Several randomised trials comparing stenting to angioplasty alone have been reported recently, the majority favouring stenting (<LINK REF="REF-Dake-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dake 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krankenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krankenberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laird-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laird 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schillinger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillinger 2006</LINK>). All of these trials contained significant cross over, with rates of bailout stenting in the control arm ranging from 32% to 50%. In this context, it was unsurprising to find that the rate of bailout stenting in the angioplasty arm of one of the more recent studies was 50%, and 22% in the atherectomy arm (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2011</LINK>). More surprising was the unexpectedly low rate of bailout stenting in the angioplasty and stenting arms of the most recent included study (14% and 7% respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2012</LINK>) despite the more permissive indications used in this trial. This may suggest treatment of more minor lesions in the latter study, a possibility which is difficult to verify as summary TASC lesion categories were not published.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there were no high quality trials comparing atherectomy with any other established intervention for peripheral vascular disease. Meta-analysis of four low quality trials comparing atherectomy with balloon angioplasty showed no difference in primary patency rates at any time interval. Given the widespread practice, clear evidence base, and established gold standard guidelines for balloon angioplasty, atherectomy has no place in the routine treatment of people with peripheral arterial disease who are amenable to standard angioplasty. There was no evidence for atherectomy versus bypass surgery, but the use of atherectomy for more severe (TASC C or D) disease when bypass surgery is contraindicated or inappropriate should be limited to clinical trials.</P>

<P>This review has identified poor quality evidence to support atherectomy as an alternative to balloon angioplasty in maintaining primary patency at any time interval. With the exception of mortality, there was no evidence for superiority of atherectomy over angioplasty for any outcome, and distal embolisation was not reported in all trials of atherectomy.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are not sufficient to challenge the current widespread practice, clear evidence base, and established gold standard guidelines for balloon angioplasty in the routine treatment of people with peripheral arterial disease who are amenable to standard angioplasty.</P>

<P>Current evidence in this area is poor. Larger and better designed trials in selected subgroups of participants are needed.</P>
<P>Future trials should be as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Better powered to detect smaller differences. Existing evidence is sufficient to say that there is no large overwhelming benefit of atherectomy but a more moderate benefit could still exist.</LI>
<LI>Have participants separated into claudicant and critically ischaemic groups.</LI>
<LI>More rigorous with follow-up. Existing studies rate poorly in terms of outcome assessment blinding and subject attrition. It is important that future studies have both longer follow-up and blinded outcome assessment. As the procedures are often performed by interventional radiologists but followed up by vascular surgeons, this latter point should not be too difficult to achieve.</LI>
