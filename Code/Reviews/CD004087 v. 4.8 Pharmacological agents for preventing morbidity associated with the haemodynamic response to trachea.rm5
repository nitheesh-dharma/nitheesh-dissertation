<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During general anaesthesia, a tube may be inserted into the trachea (windpipe) using an instrument called a laryngoscope in order to safely deliver oxygen and anaesthetic gases and to remove carbon dioxide. This procedure is known as laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. It initiates a reflex response (the haemodynamic response to intubation) of an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Several drugs in varied doses and by different routes have been used to blunt or prevent this response in order to prevent serious complications for the heart and the brain, which may even be fatal. This is because the increase in blood pressure and heart rate may put undue stress on the heart and the brain circulation. In some patients it may lead to abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias) and lack of oxygen to the heart muscle (myocardial ischaemia) resulting in changes in recorded electrical activity of the heart (shown on the electrocardiogram (ECG)), heart failure, or stroke. In spite of several studies on the use of drugs to suppress this response, it remains unclear what the best drugs to use are and in what dosages.</P>
<P>We included adult patients aged 18 years and above undergoing elective surgery in the operating room setting. We found that the effects of drugs on the stress response was the subject of 72 studies. The investigators used 32 drugs. Promising results were seen in the reduction of arrhythmias with intravenous injections of beta blockers (drugs that decrease the heart rate), narcotics (drug used to treat pain), local anaesthetics, and calcium channel blockers (drugs that block movement of calcium). Serious side effects were only reported with high doses of narcotics and an increase in airway pressure was seen in some patients with beta blockers. Only local anaesthetic drugs clearly reduced the risk of myocardial ischaemia but this evidence came from only one trial.</P>
<P>There was some difficulty in comparing and interpreting the results of these different trials. Patients at a high risk of complications were investigated in 17 trials. A reduction in arrhythmias with treatment was seen in this high risk group but the number of studies was too small to reach a conclusion. Doctors need to further research the effects of drugs used for blunting the haemodynamic response and their effect on outcomes in terms of morbidity, in a standardized manner.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-06-08 06:01:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in preventing the morbidity and mortality resulting from the haemodynamic changes in response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in adult patients aged 18 years and above who were undergoing elective surgery in the operating room setting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-08 06:04:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), and the bibliographies of published studies. We reran our search from June 2011 to December 2012 and will deal with these studies when we update the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-06-08 06:58:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug used as an intervention for preventing or attenuating the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation to a control group, and that mentioned mortality, major morbidity, arrhythmia or electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of ischaemia in the methodology, results, or discussion section of the reports.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-08 06:08:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the outcome data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 72 RCTs. The included trials studied the effects of 32 drugs belonging to different pharmacological groups. Only two trials mentioned the primary outcome of morbidity and mortality related to the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Of the secondary outcomes, 40 of the included trials observed arrhythmia only, 11 observed myocardial ischaemia only and 20 observed both arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia. Arrhythmias were observed in 2932 participants and myocardial ischaemia in 1616 participants. Arrhythmias were observed in 134 out of 993 patients in the control group compared to 80 out of 1939 in the intervention group. The risk of arrhythmias was significantly reduced with pharmacological interventions in the pooled data (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.19, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26, P &lt; 0.00001, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 47%). Local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and narcotics reduced the risk of arrhythmia in the intervention group compared to the control group. Myocardial ischaemia was observed in 21 out of 604 patients in the control group compared to 10 out of 1012 in the treatment group; the result was statistically significant (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92, P = 0.03, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 19%). However, in subgroup analysis only local anaesthetics significantly reduced the ECG changes indicating ischaemia, but this evidence came from one study. The majority of the studies had a negative outcome. Hypotension and bradycardia were reported with 40 µg kg<SUP>-1</SUP> intravenous alfentanil, chest rigidity with 75 ug kg<SUP>-1</SUP> alfentanil, and increased bronchomotor tone with sympathetic blockers.</P>
<P>There were 17 studies which included high risk patients. Pharmacological treatment in this group resulted in the reduction of arrhythmias when the data from nine trials looking at arrhythmias were pooled (Peto OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59, P = 0.005, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 80%). The analysis from four studies was not included. Three of these trials looked at the effect of sympathetic blockers but arrhythmias or myocardial ischaemia was observed throughout the perioperative period in two studies and some patients had arrhythmias due to atropine premedication in the third study. In the fourth study the authors mentioned myocardial ischaemia in the objectives section but did not report it in the results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of arrhythmias associated with tracheal intubation was significantly reduced with pre-induction administration of local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and narcotics compared to placebo. Pharmacological intervention also reduced the risk of ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia in the pooled data. Lignocaine pretreatment showed a significant effect but evidence came from one study only. The data suggested that there may be a reduction in ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia with beta blocker pretreatment but this difference was not statistically significant. There is a need to focus on outcomes rather than haemodynamic measurements alone when studying this response in future trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-08 06:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation are associated with a sympathetically mediated increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may be deleterious in patients with underlying cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Shribman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shribman 1987</LINK>). These changes are of little consequence in healthy patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kovac-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovac 1996</LINK>) but have lead to myocardial ischaemia (reduced blood supply to the muscles of the heart) (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>), malignant ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal rhythm), cardiac failure (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1977</LINK>), intracranial haemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>) in vulnerable patients.</P>
<P>Several drugs belonging to different pharmacological classes have been used in either attenuating or obliterating this response. These include narcotics (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAtamney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAtamney 1998</LINK>), local anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2009</LINK>), calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Atlee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Atlee 2000</LINK>) and other peripheral vasodilators, sympathetic blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 1995</LINK>), and centrally acting adrenergic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Scheinin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinin 1992</LINK>). Each class has undesirable side effects. The majority of studies do not provide any information regarding outcome in terms of morbidity. Few studies have evaluated the risk of ischaemia and arrhythmias induced by laryngoscopy and intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahajan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mahajan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Puri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zargar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zargar 2002</LINK>), but no clear cause effect relationship has been established. It still needs to be shown that suppression of this response is of benefit to the patients in terms of outcome.</P>

<P>We (FK, HU) independently reviewed the titles and the abstracts of the studies and reached a consensus on the abstracts that met the inclusion criteria. In the case of a disagreement regarding the inclusion of an abstract, we obtained the full article. We independently reviewed the full texts of all identified abstracts. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. As no major conflict arose we did not require a third review author. We were not blinded to the names of the authors, the institution, or the journal of publication.</P>
<P>We included RCTs on adult patients undergoing elective surgery, of either sex and any race, aged 18 years and above, who received a pharmacological intervention before or at induction of anaesthesia to prevent the haemodynamic response related to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.</P>
<P>We excluded RCTs involving patients in whom tracheal intubation was performed in other settings, for example the intensive care unit (ICU) or accident and emergency unit, or were undergoing emergency surgery. We also excluded trials without control groups. We excluded studies of tracheal intubation without the use of muscle relaxants or which involved the administration of induction agent with a target controlled infusion pump. We also excluded studies that simply mentioned looking for an 'abnormality in ECG' or 'changes in ECG'. This is because these authors did not differentiate between arrhythmias and the ECG changes of ischaemia.</P>
<P>We also tried contacting some of the study authors for clarification (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Razek-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Razek 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1996</LINK>) but to date we have not received a reply.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-08 07:21:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We (FK, HU) independently evaluated the validity and design characteristics of each selected study. This included: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; and selective reporting, as recommended in the Cochrane Collaboration's recommended tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We classified each trial quality component as: 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias', or 'unclear risk of bias'. We assessed attrition bias as low if the number of participants recruited in the trial was the same as the number of participants in whom the results were reported, or if an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis had been performed after attrition. We assessed selective reporting as at low risk of bias if the expected outcome was pre-specified in the methodology section of the study. We resolved disagreements by discussion.</P>

The outcomes were rare events, therefore we used Peto's OR to estimate the effect size. We expressed the treatment effect as a pooled OR with 95% confidence interval (CI). We plotted the results of each study as point estimates with corresponding 95% CIs. We did not generate plots where only a single study was available for an intervention; these are mentioned in the text description and tallied in <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>

<P>We planned the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Based on the pharmacological class of drugs that were used for suppressing the haemodynamic response related to tracheal intubation. These groups were: local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, sympathetic blockers, peripheral vasodilators, centrally acting alpha agonists, ACE inhibitors, narcotics, and a miscellaneous drugs group.</LI>
<LI>Based on trials using the same drug within a single pharmacological group.</LI>
<LI>Based on enrolment into the trials of high risk patients who were likely to have a higher risk of outcome events versus low risk patients.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For trials dealing with more than one pharmacological group, we broke them into the review intervention groups (one study group receiving one drug = one intervention). We then combined data from these individual intervention groups with the other studies of the same experimental pharmacological group to make a single group for subgroup analysis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>This review concerns the randomized evidence for the use of pharmacological agents to modify the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Specifically, we have collated the data on the clinically relevant outcomes of morbidity and mortality (primary outcomes) and the surrogate measures (secondary outcomes) arrhythmia and ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Only two studies reported each of our primary outcomes of mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1991</LINK>). Neither of these outcomes was reported in any arm of any other study, suggesting that these clinical outcomes are probably rare (as we anticipated).</P>
<P>To find out the risk of arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia, we reviewed 72 studies involving eight different pharmacological groups (local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, sympathetic blockers, peripheral vasodilators, centrally acting alpha agonists, narcotics, ACE inhibitors, and a group of miscellaneous drugs). We found data on a total of 32 different drugs.Data from four trials was not included in the analysis. In total, 60 studies reported arrhythmias and 31 reported the ECG changes of myocardial ischaemia as an outcome measure. Our systematic review suggests that the pre-anaesthetic administration of local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or narcotics is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of arrhythmias associated with laryngoscopy and intubation when compared to placebo. Arrhythmias were observed in 134 out of 993 patients in the control group compared to 80 out of 1939 in the intervention group (P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>In total, 31 studies included myocardial ischaemia as an outcome. None of the studies examined the association of intraoperative ECG changes to any clinical outcome such as postoperative myocardial infarction or postoperative persistent changes in ECG. Overall, the use of pharmacological agents resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of ischaemic episodes. Myocardial ischaemia was observed in 21 out of 604 patients in the control group compared to 10 out of 1012 in the treatment group with a statistically significant result (P = 0.01). This result should be treated with caution, however, because in 20 of the included studies no patient in either the control or interventional group suffered this outcome and thus only nine studies contributed to the analysis. Further, the local anaesthetic group was the only subgroup analysis that indicated a significant difference with pretreatment, and that analysis was dominated by a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Asfar-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 1990</LINK>). The largest subgroup contributing to this data was studies with beta blockers (five studies with positive outcomes) and pretreatment did not show a statistically significant difference compared to placebo. These results could be explained on the basis that myocardial ischaemia was a relatively rare event and the studies were underpowered to look at this complication. Larger datasets may be required to reach meaningful conclusions.</P>
<P>In the subgroup analysis comparing the effects of pharmacological agents on the risk of myocardial ischaemia in high risk patients versus low risk patients, treatment was effective in low risk patients but no effect was observed in high risk patients. This could again be due to the rarity of the events or due to the fact that patients may have been on other medications that may influence the outcome. More studies are needed in the high risk population.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The majority of studies (70%) in our review were conducted in relatively healthy ASA 1 and 2 patients, and therefore there are limitations in extrapolating these results to high risk, vulnerable patients. There were only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1991</LINK>) that reported our primary outcome but provided no details. Most of the remaining studies were primarily designed to observe the blood pressure and heart rate changes, and only nine studies addressed the consequence of these changes as part of their objectives or methodology (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ko-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ko 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mallon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>). We were unable to usefully compare the effectiveness of individual drugs within each pharmacological class because of the variation in dose, timing, and route of administration. This review nevertheless suggests that even these low risk patients are susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia and ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia as a consequence of haemodynamic changes related to tracheal intubation. Of these low risk patients, 13% had arrhythmias and 1.4 % had myocardial ischaemia when a placebo was given prior to laryngoscopy and intubation. Pre-induction use of pharmacological agents reduced this risk to 4.5% for arrhythmias and nil for myocardial ischaemia.</P>
<P>In clinical practice, the use of agents to reduce the response to laryngoscopy and intubation is likely to be of most importance in those patients at high risk of morbidity due to concurrent cardiovascular disease. In this review, 17 (23%) of the studies were conducted in high risk patients; two enrolled hypertensive patients, 12 enrolled patients with coronary artery disease, two enrolled neurosurgical patients, and one enrolled patients with carotid artery disease. Data from two of these studies were not subjected to analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1988</LINK>). It is in this vulnerable population of patients where it is most important to attenuate the haemodynamic response related to tracheal intubation in order to avoid important morbidity. When the high risk studies were pooled (15 studies), pharmacological treatment resulted in a reduction in the risk of arrhythmias but not in ECG evidence of ischaemia. It is difficult to comment on the negative results as, despite pooling these studies, our analysis may still be underpowered to reliably quantify any protective effect. There was also considerable heterogeneity with varying doses of individual agents used in these studies, therefore a particular dose of any agent cannot be recommended.</P>
<P>All the studies in our review only mentioned the nature and the risk of arrhythmia but did not comment on the percentage of participants requiring treatment or any further morbidity related to the rhythm disturbance. Patient anxiety was not taken into consideration and indeed, the premedication given to the participants was variable and may have influenced the outcome in some trials.</P>
<P>Different ECG leads were used for detection of myocardial ischaemia. Some studies used lead 2 for intraoperative ECG monitoring, whereas others did not mention the lead used. Lead 2 is not the best lead to be used for intraoperative ECG monitoring of ischaemia.</P>
<P>Substantial heterogeneity was seen in the results with two of the groups that is local anaesthetics (I² = 79%) and narcotics (I² = 58%) suggesting that drug effect may not be uniform across these groups. On the other hand, the calcium channel blocker group and beta blocker group were fairly homogenous across the studies indicating that different drugs within these classes may exhibit a similar magnitude of effect.</P>
<P>Pharmacological treatment was seen to be effective in both high risk and low risk patients, but substantial heterogeneity was seen in the studies of high risk patients for arrhythmia (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 80%).</P>
<P>Despite this clinical heterogeneity, the studies did show a benefit over placebo with some pharmacological agents in decreasing the risk of arrhythmia and future research should concentrate on further evaluation of these drugs.</P>
<P>The above limitations should be kept in mind when applying this evidence in everyday practice</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>While we only included randomized studies in this review, many of them (particularly those done before year 2000) did not report details of randomization and treatment allocation. We included both blinded and non-blinded studies. Many of the blinded studies did not report the details of the blinding process. Therefore, in general, the methodological quality of the majority of the included studies was poor (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were many other sources of heterogeneity present in this review. In total, 27 studies used only a small sample size of 10 or fewer participants in one of the study arms. This is likely to result in a lot of random variation. A sample size calculation was again not mentioned in the majority of studies.</P>
<P>Different routes and dosages were used in the same pharmacological group or for the same drug in the different studies. There were also variations in the use of induction agents and the muscle relaxant used for tracheal intubation. The timing of the administration of the same drugs in relation to induction was different in different studies. Factors like duration of laryngoscopy were controlled in some studies but not in all. This type of heterogeneity made it difficult to compare different trials of even the same drug. Because of this heterogeneity we were unable to get an answer to our third review question that is whether the route of administration of the agents was associated with a significant difference in respect of the studied outcomes.</P>

<P>We are unaware of other systematic reviews specifically addressing the complications related to the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Two systematic reviews addressed the efficacy of esmolol (<LINK REF="REF-Figueredo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueredo 2001</LINK>) and landilol ( <LINK REF="REF-Ionue-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ionue 2009</LINK>) on the haemodynamic changes following laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation but they did not include myocardial ischaemia or arrhythmia as an outcome. Another narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Kovac-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovac 1996</LINK>) reviewed the common causes and treatment of hypertension and tachycardia during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation but did not include myocardial ischaemia or arrhythmia as an outcome. A French narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Bruder-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruder 1992</LINK>) looked at the consequences and prevention methods of haemodynamic changes during laryngoscopy and intratracheal intubation. We are awaiting translation of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that pre-induction or co-induction administration of local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or narcotics are effective in reducing the risk of arrhythmias associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. There is no evidence that these agents influence morbidity or mortality in this setting. The evidence does not allow us to determine a recommended dose or route of administration for these agents.</P>
<P>The results of a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Asfar-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 1990</LINK>) suggest that the administration of lignocaine in this setting also reduces the risk of ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischaemia. Overall, these studies have a low power to detect a reduction in the risk of such changes and we are unable to confirm any benefit from the use of other agents for this purpose.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-08 12:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a deficiency of literature that has looked at morbidity related to the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation and there is need to focus on this aspect in future research. Researchers looking at the blood pressure and heart rate responses should report the consequences of these short lived changes and refer to them as part of their methodology rather than a chance comment in the results. They should also look at short term immediate effects as well as any postoperative effects of these changes. The identified trials were heterogeneous in terms of drug dosages, routes of administration, and timing of intervention of the same drug as well as different study drugs and the anaesthetic drugs used for induction. These need to be standardized to allow pooling of data.</P>
<P>Most literature on the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation has focused on healthy ASA 1 and 2 patients. In view of the difficulty in undertaking placebo controlled trials in the high risk population, a combination of smaller doses of effective drugs can be compared with doses of single drugs that were found effective in isolated studies.</P>
<P>Randomized controlled trials may not be a good study design to assess the rate of complications for interventions like tracheal intubation. One approach may be to establish prospective registries or a multi-database for a large cohort. Recently a similar approach was taken for looking at complications related to paediatric regional blocks, where a consortium of 14 North American hospitals established the Paediatric Regional Anaesthesia Network (PRAN) to study paediatric epidural data. They recently published their report on the first three years of data (<LINK REF="REF-Polaner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polaner 2012</LINK>). Another design approach could be a large scale survey, or well designed national or regional audits. An example of such a survey is NAP 3 in the UK, which was undertaken to study the major complications of central neuraxial blocks (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2009</LINK>).</P>
