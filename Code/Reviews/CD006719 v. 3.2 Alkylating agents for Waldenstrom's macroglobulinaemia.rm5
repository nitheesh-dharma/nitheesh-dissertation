<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-07 09:22:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) is an uncommon B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by bone marrow infiltration and production of monoclonal immunoglobulin. It is a kind of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which can lead to death. Alkylating agents are believed to be effective in treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia for alleviating symptoms and elongating survival time. The review authors found one randomised controlled trial with 92 participants that considered fludarabine was superior to the alkylating agents-containing regimen for pretreated/relapsed patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 09:21:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>One trial involving 92 participants with pretreated/relapsed WM compared the effect of fludarabine versus the combination of cyclophosphamide (the alkylating agent), doxorubicin and prednisone (CAP). Compared to CAP, the Hazard ratio (HR) for deaths of treatment with fludarabine was estimated to be 1.04, with a standard error of 0.30 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.48) and it indicated that the mean difference of median survival time was -4.00 months, and 16.00 months for response duration. The relative risks (RR) of response rate was 2.80 (95% CI 1.10 to 7.12). There were no statistically difference in overall survival rate and median survival months, while on the basis of response rate and response duration, fludarabine seemed to be superior to CAP for pretreated/relapsed patients with macroglobulinaemia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-07 09:22:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) is an uncommon B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration and production of monoclonal immunoglobulin M. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia should be regarded as a distinct clinicopathologic entity and be confined to those patients with lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma who have demonstrable serum IgM monoclonal protein (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>).<BR/>Herrinton <I>et al </I>identified persons who were less than 85 years old with newly diagnosed with WM through 1989. He suggested that the age-standardized annual incidence rate was 6.1 per million in white men and 2.5 per million in white women (1980 US standard). Cases reported in black women, indicate the age-standardized annual incidence rate as 3.6 per million. No cases were reported among black men (5.8 cases expected, based on the rates in white men), which may be due to chance, under-diagnosis of WM, or may reflect a truly low rate (Herrinton 1993).<BR/>Groves <I>et al</I> evaluated the incidence of WM reported in 11 population-based cancer registries in the USA and found a total of 624 cases diagnosed between January 1, 1988 (when WM became reportable) and December 31, 1994. Reported age-adjusted incidence rates for WM (per 1 million person-years at risk) were 3.4 among males and 1.7 among females. The rates increased sharply with age, from 0.1 at age &lt; 45 years to 36.3 at age 75+ years (males) and from 0.1 at age &lt; 45 years to 16.4 at age 75+ years (females). The data also indicated that the rates for WM were comparable to those for hairy cell leukaemia, but considerably lower than those for multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Some geographic variation was evident among the data, with age-adjusted rates among white males ranging from 2.2 to 7.8 across registries. There was no significant change in rates over the seven-year study period (P &gt; 0.05), and the markedly higher rates for WM among whites than blacks stand in contrast to multiple myeloma, which occurs twice as often among blacks (<LINK REF="REF-Groves-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groves 1998</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 14:53:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Plasma exchange is indicated for the acute management of patients with severe problems due to a circulating paraprotein (<LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2005</LINK>). In younger patients, in whom high-dose treatment is contemplated, there is a role for the use of rituximab; however, it should be administered with caution in patients with high levels of immunoglobulin M paraprotein or signs of hyperviscosity because of the risk of 'flare' in the paraprotein level and consequent adverse clinical events (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>). There are also some other methods such as splenectomy, autologous stem-cell therapy, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, interferons and some new agents (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alkylating agent-based treatments, combination therapy or purine analogues are all suitable choices for the initial therapy of patients requiring treatment, nevertheless there are no comparative data (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>). The administration of oral alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil, melphalan or cyclophosphamide is the standard primary therapy for patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. The agent most commonly used is oral chlorambucil. Approximately 50% of patients achieve a partial response, but complete responses are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>). After treatment with chlorambucil, the rate of disease of monoclonal protein level is slow, and several months are required to determine the chemosensitivity of the disease. The addition of corticosteroids does not seem to increase response rate or survival (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 1994</LINK>; Dimopoulos 2000). Chen <I>et al</I> also considered that the addition of prednisone contributes less to the response rate (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>). Combination chemotherapy with more than one alkylator has been used in WM, but there is no evidence of enhanced efficacy over single-agents alkylators (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>). Petrucci <I>et al</I> treated 31 previously untreated, symptomatic WM patients with a simple combination of melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone every four to six weeks for 12 cycles. Twenty three of 31 evaluated patients (74%) for overall response rate were detected and the overall median event-free survival duration was 66 months, which did not appear significantly better than those of chlorambucil alone (<LINK REF="REF-Petrucci-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrucci 1989</LINK>). Vincristine, BCNU, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone had a response rate of 81% in 33 patients, which did not appear superior to that seen with the single alkylating agent chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Case-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Case 1991</LINK>). Nowadays, there is a trend to use the combination of alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues and rituximab as first choice. Weber <I>et al</I> administered the combination of rituximab, cladribine and cyclophosphamide to 17 previously untreated patients with WM. At least a partial response was documented in 94% of patients, including a complete response in 18%. With a median follow up of 21 months, no patient has relapsed, which suggested the effect of combination of alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues and rituximab seems better than the isolated alkylator and the combination of alkylating agents and supported by a small phase studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chlorambucil is administered either on a daily basis at low doses or intermittently at higher doses (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>).The daily basis at low doses or intermittently at higher doses has the same median survival years as 5.4 years (<LINK REF="STD-Kyle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kyle 2000</LINK>). The optimal duration of chlorambucil administration has not been prospectively defined.</P>
<P>Since alkylating agents have been a mainstay of therapy for macroglobulinaemia for many years, long-term adverse effects like myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia are known (<LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2000</LINK>). The Mayo Clinic reported an unexpectedly high incidence of myelodysplastic syndromes (3 of 46 patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 14:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Prospective studies are needed to assess whether rituximab should be combined with nucleoside analogues, alkylating agents or both classes of agents (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2005</LINK>). In view of the rarity of WM, most studies contain a small number of patients and are not adequately powered, it is difficult to compare the results of these studies. Moreover the cumulative myelosuppression and immunosuppression that these combinations may induce is an important issue.<BR/>There is an inadequate evidence base to determine how effectivene and safe the alkylating agents are and indeed how the isolated agents, combination of alkylators and combinations involving alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues and rituximab react in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. It is thus important to prepare a systematic review to evaluate the effect and safety of alkylating agents in the treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 14:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>For dichotomous data, we calculated a weighted estimate of treatment effect across trials relative risks (RR) using the standard fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel). In order to obtain numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB), we used the estimated RR from a meta analysis and a baseline risk. We calculated continuous data as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals and summarized if appropriate. To deal with the missing data, when the trials had reported medians instead of means without range, we assumed that the difference in medians is equal to that in means, and the estimated standard deviation was considered equivalent to a half of the reported median (<LINK REF="REF-Hosono-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosono 2006</LINK>). Because this method is not robust (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). So we just used for calculating the mean difference rather than the confidence interval. Furthermore, no confidence interval would be reported for these kind of results. Time to event data was calculated as Hazard Ratios (HR) according to Parmar (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>If in an update search more trials will be detected, publication bias will be assessed by using the Funnel plot. Heterogeneity of treatment effect between trials will be tested using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with significance being set at P &lt; 0.10. I<SUP>2</SUP> will be used to estimate total variation across studies that will be due to heterogeneity rather than chance in percentage. Smaller than 25% will be considered as low level heterogeneity, 25% to 50% as moderate level, and higher than 50% as high level (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Expected causes of heterogeneity will be assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Unexpected causes of heterogeneity will be explored by meta-regression after performing a subgroup analysis with the software of STATA. The other analyses will be be conducted using RevMan 5.0.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-07 09:23:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia is a rare haematological neoplasm with an incidence of approximately three per million people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Groves-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groves 1998</LINK>; Herrinton 1993).<BR/>The standard therapy for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia has been alkylating agents, which in general are well tolerated and can achieve a response. But as mentioned above, the real effect of alkylating agents need to be evaluated in prospective studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Results of our research</HEADING>
<P>The included multicenter prospective randomised comparative trial compared the activity of fludarabine to the combination of cyclophosphamide (the alkylating agent), doxorubicin and prednisone (CAP). Ninety-two patients, 42 with primary refractory disease and 50 with relapsed disease were randomly allocated to the fludarabine group in which 25 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> on day one to five were given to the patients or the CAP group with 750 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> cyclophosphamide and 25 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> doxorubicin on day 1 and 40 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> prednisone on day one to five. Twenty-eight per cent of those treated with fludarabine responded compared to 11% in the CAP group (P &lt; 0.05).This finding could not be verified by analysing the median survival time. There was no significant difference between the two groups (41 versus 45 months). The overall survival rates were similar in both groups although a significant benefit in the fludarabine group in terms of duration of response and event-free survival rate exists (<LINK REF="STD-Leblond-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leblond 2001</LINK>).<BR/>Our results showed no statistical differences in overall survival rate and median survival time, and favoured the fludarabine group in response rate and response duration. Based on the number and duration of respond and the event-free survival rate, fludarabine seemed to be more effective than CAP for pretreated/relapsed patients. The lack of difference in overall survival rate could be explained by efficient salvage treatment after relapse and the higher rate of deaths unrelated to disease progression in the fludarabine group (<LINK REF="STD-Leblond-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leblond 2001</LINK>). Considering the controversial efficacy of fludarabine (the complete response rate is low, and the treatment related mortality is relatively high) as first-line therapy <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="REF-Foran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foran 1999</LINK>
<U>)</U>, multicenter trials comparing the efficacy of fludarabine with that of chlorambucil in untreated patients should be established (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leblond-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leblond 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality-adjusted survival analysis was proposed to integrate quality of life considerations into the treatment comparison. As a basis for comparison of the effect of different treatments on the average course for patients, quality-adjusted survival analysis allows the combination of endpoints such as treatment-related toxicity (TOX), treatment free of toxicity (CT), no treatment or symptoms (TWiST), and relapse (REL) (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2001</LINK>). The quality-adjusted survival analysis on the 92 patients indicated that with respect to the mean CT and mean TOX, no differences were found between the two groups except a significant alopecia in CAP groups. Mean TWiST was 5.9 months longer in the FAMP group and mean REL was increased by 6.8 months in the CAP group (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The results were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. The methodology of this trial is relatively high according to the Jadad score, but the unidentified method of randomisation may cause the difficulty to confirm whether an inappropriate randomly allocation leading to selective bias. The unclear allocation concealment and blinding also would promote the existences of selective and performance biases. Although most of the baseline conditions had no differences, the different levels of haemoglobin and C-reactive protein in the two groups might be confounding factors.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>In this article, we assumed that the difference in medians is equal to that in means, and the estimated standard deviation was considered equivalent to a half of the reported median (<LINK REF="REF-Hosono-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosono 2006</LINK>), which may bring some biases.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ongoing trials</HEADING>
<P>In an ongoing prospective randomised trial untreated patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia are assigned to the chlorambucil group (A dose of 8 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (6 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for those &gt; 75 years of age) is given orally for 10 days every 28 days until maximum response is achieved or for a maximum of 12 months) or to the fludarabine group (An oral dose of 40 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or an Intravenous dose of 25 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (30 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> orally or 20 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for those &gt; 75 years of age) is given for five days every 28 days with repeating for three to six cycles). The primary endpoints are response rates and duration of response, while the secondary endpoints are hematologic parameters, toxicity, quality of life and survival. We are anticipating the results of this randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other trials about the effect of alkylating agents</HEADING>
<P>Although alkylating agents have been used for decades though they have never been tested in a randomised trial, they are believed to be effective in treatingWaldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, alleviating symptoms and elongating survival time.<BR/>
<U>I</U>n one trial 128 consecutive patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia were treated with chlorambucil (0.1 mg/kg/d) until 6 to 12 months after a plateau IgM had been obtained in serum, in which 117 were new diagnosed and 11 had the disease. Eight patients who were considered refractory to chlorambucil received various combinations, including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, or doxorubicin. The median survival duration for all patients was 60 months (<LINK REF="REF-Facon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facon 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another non-randomised trial, 34 patients with WM were treated using an oral combination consisting of melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone for induction therapy followed by continuous therapy of chlorambucil and prednisone. To induction therapy 74% (23/31) had responded with eight complete remissions. The overall median event-free survival duration for responding patients was 66 months (<LINK REF="REF-Petrucci-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrucci 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vincristine, BCNU, melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone had a response rate of 81% in 33 patients, which also did not appear superior to that seen with the single alkylating agent chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Case-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Case 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>On an intent-to-treat basis, 83% of patients (N = 72) (95% CI 73% to 91%) treated with dexamethasone, rituximab and cyclophosphamide achieved a response, including 7% complete, 67% partial, and 9% minor responses. The median time to response was 4.1 months. The two-year progression-free survival rate and two-year disease-specific survival rate were 67% and 90% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another non-randomised trial 72 new diagnosed patients with WM who were treated with melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone had been evaluated. The overall response rate was 77% (55/72) with seven stable diseases and nine progresses. The median durations of event-free survival, freedom from progression, response, and overall survival were 47, 55, 64, and 66 months, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Annibali-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annibali 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two treatment regimens has been investigated by Dimopoulos MA <I>et al</I>, in which 16 patients treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone had reached 44% overall response rate as well as 36 months of median response duration, while 20 patients given CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) had an observed 65% overall response rate with 88 months of median response duration (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 1994</LINK>). Although the trials above were not designed as randomised trials, they also could indicate that the usage of alkylating agents alone or combination with other drugs can prolong the the survival time and relieve symptoms in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. This widely used treatment, however, should be supported by further well-designed studies, especially the RCT.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Continuous or intermittent chlorambucil therapy for untreated Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia</HEADING>
<P>A prospective randomised unblinded study performed by Kyle RA <I>et al</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Kyle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kyle 2000</LINK>) has compared continuous and intermittent chlorambucil therapy for 46 untreated patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia.The patients were randomly assigned to continuous chlorambucil (N = 24) with chlorambucil 0.1 mg/kg/d orally or to intermittent chlorambucil with 0.3 mg/kg/d orally for seven days (N = 22).There was no significant difference on response rates (79% versus 68%) and median duration of survival (5.4 years). The author concluded chlorambucil was an effective agent and should be compared with purine analogues or rituximab in a prospective study. Moreover the effectiveness of combination with corticosteroid should be further evaluated in a well-established trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Combination with or without corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>There are no randomised trials evaluating the efficacy of alkylating agents. Data from a non-randomised trial suggest that the addition of corticosteroids does not increase response rate or survival (<LINK REF="REF-Dimopoulos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimopoulos 1994</LINK>; Dimopoulos 2000 ). Furtherresearch is required .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The effect of combination therapy</HEADING>
<P>In one trial testing alkylating agents combined with chemotherapy 13 patients of whom10 had untreated Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia were enrolled.The treatment consists of a combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP-R) for six cycles followed by rituximab maintenance. Three complete responses and nine incomplete responses were detected (<LINK REF="STD-Treon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Treon 2005</LINK>). To investigate the efficacy of this combination in detail, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group is performing one trial (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tam <I>et al</I> described the treatment of nine patients with WM who were treated with a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab. The overall response rate was 56% with no observation of complete responses (<LINK REF="STD-Tam-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2006</LINK>).<BR/>Furthermore, the comparisons of efficacy among alkylator alone, combination therapy consisting of alkylators, alkylating agents, nucleoside analogs and rituximab needed to be further tested in a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial. In addition, alkylating agents plus methods such as stem cell transplantation also should be evaluated in well-designed studies (<LINK REF="STD-German-2007" TYPE="STUDY">German 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effect of alkylating agents</HEADING>
<P>The adverse effect of alkylating agents has often been well tolerated with usually only mild to moderate hematological toxicity. Leblond 2001 reported that there was no statistical difference between the fludarabine group and CAP group respecting to hematological toxicity or infections but there was more mucositis and alopecia occurrence in the CAP group. Four patients died of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in fludarabine group, while two in the CAP group (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Annibali O <I>et al</I> found no WHO Grade III or IV toxicities in the 72 newly diagnosed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia cases. Side effects were limited to transient nausea, emesis and mild neutropenia under the treatment of oral melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (<LINK REF="REF-Annibali-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annibali 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two patients (N = 13) had febrile neutropenia with documented bacteraemia and recovered without complication in the treatment of rituximab plus CHOP (<LINK REF="STD-Treon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Treon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the treatment of M-2 protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Case-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Case 1991</LINK>), the lowest median WBC during the first cycle was 3000/mm<SUP>3</SUP> (1000 to 5500). Nausea/vomiting, anaemia requiring transfusions and alopecia were observed in approximately 25% of patients. Sepsis were detected in 2/33 patients.</P>
<P>As for the long-term adverse effects, Van Den Neste E <I>et al</I> reported that 12 (32%) patients developed autoimmune manifestations and five (13%) patients developed secondary cancers (myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelocytic leukaemia in three, lung cancer in two) after the treatment of combination of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and cyclophosphamide for the advanced lymphoproliferative malignancies (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Den-Neste-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Den Neste 2004</LINK>). Myelodysplasia and acute myelogeneous leukaemia had appeared after chemotherapy with alkylating agents (<LINK REF="REF-Horsman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsman 1983</LINK>).</P>
