<P>
<B>Review question: </B>In preterm infants whose mothers want to breast feed, does using bottles interfere with breast feeding success?<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Background: </B>Preterm infants start milk feeds by tube, and as they mature they are able to manage sucking feeds. The number of sucking feeds each day is gradually increased as the baby matures. Women who choose to breast feed their preterm infant may find that it is not always possible to be there every time the baby needs a sucking feed. Conventionally, bottles with mother's milk or formula have been used. It has been suggested that using bottles may interfere with breast feeding success.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Study characteristics: </B>In searches updated to July 2016, we found seven eligible studies (involving 1152 preterm babies). These studies were of small to moderate size, and most had some problems with study design or conduct.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Key results: </B>Five of the studies (which included two of the largest studies) used cup feeds, and one used tube feeds. One study used a specially designed teat with feeding action suggested to be more like breast feeding than conventional bottle feeding. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, only two in middle-income countries and none in low-income countries. Overall if bottle feeds (with a conventional teat) were not given, babies were more likely to be fully breast fed or to have at least some breast feeds on discharge home and at three and six months after discharge home. The study with the specially designed teat showed no difference in breast feeding outcomes, so it was the cup alone or the tube alone that improved breast feeding rates. However, because of the poor quality of the tube alone study, we cannot recommend a tube feeding strategy until further studies of high quality are undertaken. We found no evidence of benefit or harm for any of the reported outcomes, including length of hospital stay or weight gain.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions:</B> Using a cup instead of a bottle increases the extent and duration of breast feeding in preterm infants. Additional studies are needed before a tube alone approach can be recommended.<B>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-04 12:47:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials with 1152 preterm infants. Five studies used a cup feeding strategy, one used a tube feeding strategy and one used a novel teat when supplements to breast feeds were needed. We included the novel teat study in this review, as the teat was designed to more closely mimic the sucking action of breast feeding. The trials were of small to moderate size, and two had high risk of attrition bias. Adherence with cup feeding was poor in one of the studies, indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents; the remaining four cup feeding studies provided no such reports of dissatisfaction or low adherence. Meta-analyses provided evidence of low to moderate quality indicating that avoiding bottles increases the extent of breast feeding on discharge home (full breast feeding typical risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.80; any breast feeding RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16). Limited available evidence for three months and six months post discharge shows that avoiding bottles increases the occurrence of full breast feeding and any breast feeding at discharge and at six months post discharge, and of full (but not any) breast feeding at three months post discharge. This effect was evident at all time points for the tube alone strategy and for all except any breast feeding at three months post discharge for cup feeding. Investigators reported no clear benefit when the novel teat was used. No other benefits or harms were evident, including, in contrast to the previous (2008) review, length of hospital stay.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-04 21:43:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-04 21:42:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants begin sucking feeds when they are mature enough to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing; this occurs at around 32 to 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Lemons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 1996</LINK>). Milk feeds are given through a gavage tube until infants are able to receive all their intake by sucking feeds. Once sucking feeds begin, they are increased gradually, usually beginning with once a day and increasing as the infant demands or is assessed as ready to progress. As the number of sucking feeds increases, the number of tube feeds decreases until sucking feeds alone provide sufficient intake for growth and development. It is not always possible for a mother to be available to breast feed during this transition time. Also at times after a breast feed, the infant is assessed as having received insufficient milk, and a 'top up' with expressed breast milk or formula is required. In these instances, it is common clinical practice for milk (breast or formula) to be given by bottle in addition to any breast feeds.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-04 21:42:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alternatives to bottles during this transition time have been reported and include feeding the infant by cup (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>), gavage tube (<LINK REF="REF-Stine-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stine 1990</LINK>), finger feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Healow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healow 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurokawa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurokawa 1994</LINK>), spoon (<LINK REF="STD-Aytekin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aytekin 2014</LINK>) and paladai - a traditional feeding device used in India (<LINK REF="REF-Malhotra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malhotra 1999</LINK>). Increased breast feeding prevalence has been reported when bottle feeds were replaced by cup feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Abouelfettoh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abouelfettoh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>) or tube feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Stine-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stine 1990</LINK>), and infants have been reported to achieve all breast feeds sooner with spoon feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Aytekin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aytekin 2014</LINK>). However, these studies were small and did not include a control.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-04 12:37:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that using bottles may interfere with establishing successful breast feeding, possibly because of a difference in the sucking action required for the breast versus an artificial nipple (<LINK REF="REF-Bu_x0027_Lock-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bu'Lock 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neifert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neifert 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-04 21:43:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alternatives to breast feeds are not necessarily benign. With both bottle feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Bier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bier 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blaymore-Bier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaymore Bier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1995</LINK>) and cup feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Dowling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freer 1999</LINK>), mean oxygen saturation was lower and the frequency of oxygen desaturation was greater than with breast feeding, highlighting the importance of considering safety aspects of any alternatives to bottle feeds. Use of both cup and paladai has been associated with a tendency for infants to 'spill' a large proportion of the feed (<LINK REF="STD-Aloysius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aloysius 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dowling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowling 2002</LINK>). However, other studies have not reported problems associated with cup feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cups and similar feeding vessels are easier to clean than bottles and artificial teats; this fact may be of particular relevance for infection control in low- and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>For women who wish to breast feed their preterm infant, it is important to establish the most efficacious and least harmful method of supplementing breast feeds.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-04 14:16:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of trials (to meet validity criteria). For each trial, we sought information regarding methods of randomisation and blinding and reporting of all outcomes for all infants enrolled. We assessed each criterion as presenting low, high or unclear risk. Two review authors (CC, HS) separately assessed each study and resolved disagreements by discussion. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias across six domains according to the criteria suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included these items for appraisal.</P>

<P>We analysed treatment effects in individual trials by using Review Manager 5.3. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs), risk difference (RDs) and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTBs) or numbers needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTHs). We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates and used mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals for outcomes measured on a continuous scale. We analysed differences in the number of events for outcomes measured as count data (e.g. episodes of choking/gagging) by comparing rates of events in the two groups.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-09-04 14:27:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted meta-analyses using Review Manager software (RevMan 2014), as supplied by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: breast feeding extent and duration, length of hospital stay, growth and episodes of infection.</P>
<P>Two review authors (CC, HS) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (and two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach provides an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence based on four grades.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but may be substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions </HEADING>
<P>Those using alternative feeding devices (cup, gavage tube, paladai, finger feeding, dropper, spoon or other) were classified as the experimental group, and infants who received bottle feeding were classified as the control group.</P>
<P>Five studies compared breast feeding with supplementary feeds given by cup versus breast feeding with supplementary feeds given by bottle (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>). One trial compared breast feeding with supplementary feeds by bottle versus breast feeding with supplementary feeds by gavage tube alone (<LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Simmer-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Simmer 2016</LINK> trial used a specially developed feeding system that incorporated a shut-off valve in the teat, so that milk flowed only when the infant created a vacuum; collapse of the teat was prevented by a venting system. Infants controlled the flow of milk by raising the tongue when sucking stopped; study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Simmer-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Simmer 2016</LINK>) showed that this action was similar in breast fed term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2012</LINK>). Although this intervention uses a bottle and a teat, the review authors agreed to include this study in the review, given that the 'novel teat' causes action that is purportedly similar to the breast feeding action compared with conventional teats used in all other studies.</P>
<P>In all studies, neither bottle feeds nor alternative feeding devices (cup/tube alone/novel teat) were used to replace a breast feed and were given only when the mother was not available to breast feed, or if extra milk was thought necessary after a breast feed and investigators determined that the infant was able to take this orally.</P>
<P>Among the cup feeding studies, four (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>) followed the cup feeding recommendations of Lang (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK> used the protective cap from a bottle, <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK> a 60 mL medicine cup and <LINK REF="STD-Gilks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilks 2004</LINK> an Ameda baby cup. <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK> did not state the type of cup used and did not describe the cup feeding procedure. An indwelling nasogastric tube remained in situ for both experimental and control groups in two studies in which feeds were given by tube if insufficient milk was taken during cup or breast feeding, or if the infant was not scheduled for a sucking feed (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilks 2004</LINK>). It is not stated whether this occurred for cup feeds in the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>For breast feeding with supplementary feeds by bottle compared with breast feeding with supplementary feeds by gavage tube (<LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>), all infants received standard care (including non-nutritive breast feeding) until written orders for oral feedings were given. For the control group, all supplementary feeds were given by bottle, and the indwelling nasogastric tube was removed as directed by the clinical care team. For the experimental group (gavage tube), feeds were given by an indwelling 3.5 gauge French nasogastric tube. The tube was removed during the last 24 to 48 hours of parent 'rooming-in', at which time a cup or syringe was used if needed.</P>
<P>Skin-to-skin contact and non-nutritive sucking at the breast were encouraged for all infants in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmer-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Simmer 2016</LINK>).

<P>Sucking feeds for experimental and control groups were commenced and advanced according to individual hospital policy. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>), this decision was based on weight (1600 grams). In <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>, sucking feeds began when infants were assessed as mature enough to co-ordinate a suck-swallow-breathe reflex. In three studies, sucking feeds occurred at the discretion of the nurse or midwife (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>), the neonatologist (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>) or the neonatal nurse practitioner (<LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK>).

<P>Non-nutritive sucking with use of a dummy (also known as a pacifier) varied among the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> randomised infants to cup/no dummy, cup/dummy, bottle/no dummy and bottle/dummy, reporting no statistically significant interaction between infants randomised to no dummy or cup; therefore, results from marginal groups (cup vs bottle and dummy vs no dummy) could be analysed independently. In <LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK>, a dummy was available during tube feedings for the experimental group, and study authors did not report whether a dummy was available outside feeding times in either group.

Two per cent of women (n = 6) with 2% of infants (n = 7) in <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> had chosen to feed their infants expressed breast milk by bottle; researchers randomised three to cup feeds and four to bottle feeds.</P>
<P>At three months and six months post discharge, <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> used the term 'all breast feeds' to indicate that an infant's milk feeds were breast feeds only when no other types of milk were given, and 'partial breast feeds' to mean that an infant's milk feeds were a combination of breast feeds and other types of milk. The intent was to determine the types of milk feeds infants were receiving (breast or formula), irrespective of whether they were receiving solids. This does not fit with the conventional definition of full breast feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1990</LINK>), that is, if an infant is on solids and all milk feeds are breast feeds, the infant is usually classified as 'partially' breast feeding. The <LINK REF="REF-Collins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2008</LINK> review did not include data for 'all breast feeds' in the meta-analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Satisfaction with feeding method</HEADING>
<P>One study included views of parents on the method of feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>) and noted a high rate of non-compliance, with 56% of infants in the intervention (breast feeding with supplemental feeds by cup) group (n = 85/151) having a bottle introduced. Compliance differed between recruiting hospitals; the hospital at which cup feeding was introduced specifically for this study had a higher rate of compliance than the other recruiting hospital, where cup feeding had been practised for three years before the study began. Researchers collected data on reasons for the introduction of a bottle from the medical records or after discussion with attending nurses or midwives. Reasons for introducing a bottle were available for 74% (n = 63) of the 85 infants randomised to cup feeds who had a bottle introduced. In 65% (n = 41) of cases, the reason given for introduction of a bottle was that it was introduced at the request of the mother, and the staff initiated the bottle in 29% (n = 18) of cases. In 10% (n = 6) of cases, researchers introduced a bottle because the baby was not satisfied with cup feeds or would not settle down. One infant randomised to the bottle group had a cup introduced because of transfer to a peripheral hospital, where cup feeding was routinely done.</P>
<P>The three month post discharge questionnaire included a question to the mother on reasons for introduction of a bottle. Reasons for introducing a bottle were available for 91% (n = 77) of the 85 infants randomised to cup feeds who had a bottle introduced. Women could select from a list of options, and additional space was provided for any other comments. A total of 44% (n = 34) indicated that the decision to introduce a bottle was theirs, and 33% (n = 25) were advised by the nurse or midwife (some responded yes to both of these statements). In all, 26% (n = 20) had problems with cup feeding including inability of the infant to do it, frequent spills, dissatisfaction with cup feeds and unacceptably long feeding times. Ten (13%) of the respondents did not like cup feeds and changed feeding method because of this. Nine (12%) respondents said that the staff refused to cup feed their infant. <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> reported that some infants became less satisfied with cup feeds and more difficult to feed by this method as they neared discharge, generally during the last week of their hospital stay. Because of this, if the mother could not be present to breast feed, the infant would be tube fed. The criterion for discharge home was that the infant had to be on full sucking feeds. This may have contributed to increased length of stay in this study. However, the study author cautions that reliable data on this point were not collected (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>The strategy of avoiding bottles while an infant breast feeds is being established in preterm infants, resulting in statistically significant increases in the extent and duration of breast feeding. Studies included in this review compared cup feeding with a tube alone approach or a novel teat versus bottle feeding with a conventional teat. Across all time points (discharge home, three months and six months post discharge), both a cup feeding strategy and a tube alone strategy increased breast feeding success. We included the novel teat study in this review, as the design of the teat, in which a vacuum is created, attempted to mimic the sucking action required for breast feeding, thereby potentially supporting breast feeding success when compared with a conventional teat. Investigators found no differences in breast feeding outcomes with the novel teat, rather the cup and tube alone studies reported an increase in breast feeding. Meta-analysis of data from trials that included length of stay, weight gain and infection showed no clear evidence of benefit or harm. Limited evidence from the two trials that assessed cardiorespiratory stability suggests improved stability with avoidance of bottles.</P>

<P>The trials reviewed provide no information on the volume of feed consumed compared with the volume prescribed nor on episodes of choking/gagging per feed. We found limited information on cardiorespiratory stability and parent and health professional satisfaction with the feeding method. No studies were conducted in low-income countries, and two were completed in middle-income countries. No reports describe infants dissatisfied with tube or cup, except <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>, in which adherence with cup feeding was poor. In contrast, cup feeding had not previously been used in <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>, and staff acceptance was high, with high adherence to the intervention. Both of the largest studies were cup feeding studies, but they were conducted in different populations and settings. <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> was conducted in a high-income country in very and extremely preterm infants, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK> included moderate to late preterm infants in a high-middle-income country. <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1997</LINK> suggested that as preterm infants mature, they may be able to bottle feed with no interference with breast feeds, but she cautions that the introduction of a bottle should occur only when breast feeding is well established.

<P>We included in this review seven studies with 1152 infants. Blinding was not possible in any of the included studies and therefore was subject to caregiver influence.

We graded the level of evidence for episodes of infection and length of hospital stay as moderate and very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We downgraded outcomes because of attrition and moderate to high heterogeneity. The direction of effects of all included trials was consistent (favouring avoiding bottles) for breast feeding outcomes, but the magnitude of effects in <LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK> was inconsistent with that in the other studies. The most likely reason for this heterogeneity was the difference in the intervention provided or the poorer quality of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Kliethermes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kliethermes 1999</LINK> used supplemental feeding by tube, and <LINK REF="STD-Simmer-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Simmer 2016</LINK> a novel teat, whereas the remaining trials used supplemental feeds by cup.

<P>The heterogeneity of the included studies reveals the need for well-conducted studies of both cup feeding and a tube alone strategy. Such studies should evaluate length of hospital stay, weight gain, breast feeding prevalence on discharge home and at three months and six months post discharge and infection episodes, as well as infant, parent and staff satisfaction with the feeding method.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to categorise the risk of selection bias as:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1a. Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk: Investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process, such as referring to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, tossing a coin, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing lots or conducting minimisation.</LI>
<LI>High risk: Investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process (sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, sequence generated by some rule based on date or day of admission, sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number, allocation by judgement of the clinician, allocation by preference of the participant, allocation based on results of a laboratory test or a series of tests or allocation by availability of the intervention).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1b. Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to categorise the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk: Participant and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation), sequentially numbered drug containers or identical appearance or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.</LI>
<LI>High risk: Participant and investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers), unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation or rotation, date of birth or case record number.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Blinding (performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to categorise the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, but review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured; unlikely that blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>High risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of key trial participants and personnel attempted, but likely that blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding (detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to categorise the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, but review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured; unlikely that blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>High risk: no blinding of outcome assessment, but review authors judge that outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of outcome assessment; likely that the blinding could have been broken, and outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed by appropriate methods.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>High risk:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>"As-treated" analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Selective reporting (reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to describe how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We planned to access all protocols of the included trials through a search of clinical trials registries (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</A>; <A HREF="http://controlled-trials.com/">controlled-trials.com</A>; and <A HREF="http://who.int/ictrp">who.int/ictrp</A>) and by direct contact with trial authors.</P>
<P>We planned to assess the methods as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk: The study protocol is available, and all of the trial's prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way; or the study protocol is not available, but it is clear that published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</LI>
<LI>High risk: Not all of the trial's prespecified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes are reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a trial.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided (the study protocol is not available).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Other potential sources of bias (other bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, we planned to describe any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias is related to the specific study design used).</P>
<P>We planned to assess whether each trial was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Low risk: The trial appears to be free of other sources of bias.</LI>
<LI>High risk: The trial has at least one important risk of bias (e.g. the trial had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used or has been claimed to have been fraudulent or had some other problem).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: Risk of bias may be present, but information is insufficient for assessment of whether an important risk of bias exists, or rationale or evidence is insufficient to suggest that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
