<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Preparations from the European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) are among the most prescribed drugs in cancer patients in several European countries. Proponents claim that mistletoe extracts stimulate the immune system, improve survival, enhance quality of life and reduce adverse effects of chemo- and radiotherapy in cancer patients. The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival. Adverse effects of mistletoe extracts were reported, but appeared to be dose-dependent and primarily confined to reactions at injection site and mild, transient flu-like symptoms. In the absence of good quality, independent trials, decisions about whether mistletoe extracts are likely to be beneficial for a particular problem should rely on expert judgement and practical considerations.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-10-20 13:07:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Mistletoe extracts are commonly used in cancer patients. It is claimed that they improve survival and quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of mistletoe extracts given either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy for patients with cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Search sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2007) Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Registry of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR, INT. HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, SOMED, AMED, BIOETHICSLINE, BIOSIS, CancerLit, CATLINE, CISCOM (August 2007). </P>
<P>For the search the Standard Operating Procedures of the Information System in Health Economics at the German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI) were utilized. Reference lists of relevant articles and authors extensive files were searched for additional studies. Manufacturers of mistletoe preparations were contacted. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-20 13:07:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with cancer of any type. The interventions were mistletoe extracts as sole treatments or given concomitantly with chemo- or radiotherapy. The outcome measures were survival times, tumor response, QOL, psychological distress, adverse effects from antineoplastic treatment and safety of mistletoe extracts.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. All review authors independently took part in the extraction of data and assessment of study quality and clinical relevance. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study authors were contacted where information was unclear. Methodological quality was narratively described and additionally assessed with the Delphi list and the Jadad score. High methodological quality was defined if six out of nine Delphi criteria, or four out of five Jadad criteria were fulfilled. Results were presented qualitatively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighty studies were identified. Fifty-eight were excluded for various reasons, usually as there was no prospective trial design with randomised treatment allocation. Of the 21 included studies 13 provided data on survival, 7 on tumour response, 16 on measures of QOL or psychological outcomes, or prevalence of chemotherapy-related adverse effects and 12 on side effects of mistletoe treatment; overall comprising 3484 randomised cancer patients. Interventions evaluated were 5 preparations of mistletoe extracts from 5 manufacturers and one commercially not available preparation. The general reporting of RCTs was poor. </P>
<P>Of the 13 trials investigating survival, 6 showed some evidence of a benefit, but none of them was of high methodological quality. The results of two trials in patients with melanoma and head and neck cancer gave some evidence that the used mistletoe extracts are not effective for improving survival.</P>
<P>Of the 16 trials investigating the efficacy of mistletoe extracts for either improving QOL, psychological measures, performance index, symptom scales or the reduction of adverse effects of chemotherapy, 14 showed some evidence of a benefit, but only 2 of them including breast cancer patients during chemotherapy were of higher methodological quality. </P>
<P>Data on side effects indicated that, depending on the dose, mistletoe extracts were usually well tolerated and had few side effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that mistletoe extracts may offer benefits on measures of QOL during chemotherapy for breast cancer, but these results need replication. Overall, more high quality, independent clinical research is needed to truly assess the safety and effectiveness of mistletoe extracts. Patients receiving mistletoe therapy should be encouraged to take part in future trails.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-09 20:35:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Please refer to the glossary for the definitions of the technical terms (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of cancer with extracts from mistletoe was first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by Rudolf Steiner as part of a holistic and human-centred therapeutic approach within anthroposophically-extended medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Heusser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heusser 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Today, preparations from mistletoe extracts are the most frequently used, so-called complementary and alternative methods (CAM) in the treatment of cancer patients in German-speaking countries (<LINK REF="REF-Horneber-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horneber 2009</LINK>). In 2002, mistletoe extract was the most frequently prescribed substance in out-patient oncology clinics in Germany; health insurance companies paid for 465,000 mistletoe prescriptions. In comparison, the second most frequently prescribed substance in out-patient oncology treatment was Tamoxifen, prescribed 329,000 times (<LINK REF="REF-Schwabe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwabe 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>All commercially available mistletoe extracts are prepared from the semi-parasitic plant Viscum album Loranthaceae (Viscum album L. or European mistletoe). Brand names in Europe include ABNOBAviscum®, Cefalektin®, Eurixor®, Helixor®, Iscador®, Iscucin®, Isorel® and Lektinol®. Mistletoe grows on several types of trees, and the extracts derived from it contain numerous ingredients in varying concentrations depending on the species of the host tree, the time of year harvested and the pharmaceutical process according to which the extracts are prepared (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mistletoe preparations contain several biologically active substances: mistletoe lectins, viscotoxins, amino acids, flavonoides, polysaccharides, membrane lipids (vesicles) and other substances in low concentrations. Although studies showed a broad range of immunomodulating, cytotoxic, and antiviral effects of different extracts or isolated agents from mistleote extracts, their precise mode of action is poorly understood. Many researchers attribute therapeutic efficacy to the mistletoe lectins (ML). Therefore most investigations have been carried out on the structure and profile of action of those lectins, especially of ML-I. Mistletoe lectins induce apoptosis by inhibiting protein synthesis in ribosomal RNA (<LINK REF="REF-Bussing-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussing 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bussing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussing 1999</LINK>). In vitro, mistletoe lectins induced several cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Joller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joller 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ribereau_x002d_Gayon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribereau-Gayon 1996</LINK>) and in animals to an increase of neutrophils, large granular lymphocytes, and higher levels of phagocytosis as well as cytotoxic activity of natural killer-cells (NK-cell) were found (<LINK REF="REF-Hajto-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajto 1989</LINK>). In breast cancer patients, intravenous application also lead to an increase of the number of neutrophils and a significant rise in NK-cell activity (<LINK REF="REF-Hajto-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajto 1989</LINK>). In healthy adults increasing numbers of blood granulocytes especially eosinophils were found after application of a lectin-rich mistletoe preparation, as well as an increased production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) (<LINK REF="REF-Huber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huber 2005</LINK>), and the induction of tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which was partly mediated via cell marker CD14. (<LINK REF="REF-Heinzerling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinzerling 2006</LINK>) There is clear evidence that the application of mistletoe extracts induced anti-lectin antibodies, typically of the subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 (<LINK REF="REF-Heinzerling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinzerling 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In practice, mistletoe extracts are applied both in adjuvant and in palliative treatment situations, mainly complementing conventional tumour therapy. The generally stated therapeutic objectives are to improve QOL, to strengthen the immune system and to reduce adverse effects of chemo- or radiotherapy, and to a lesser extent to prolong survival and to enhance tumour response (<LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, there are two different approaches to the production and clinical application of mistletoe preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003b</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Phytotherapeutic mistletoe preparations which are applied at a constant dose (Cefalektin®, Eurixor®, Lektinol®). From these mistletoe preparations Lektinol® is adjusted for the content of mistletoe lectin.</LI>
<LI>Mistletoe preparations which are being produced according to pharmaceutical guidelines from anthroposophical medicine (abnovaVISCUM®, Helixor®, Iscador®, Iscucin®, Isorel®). It is assumed here that the overall pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies do not derive from a single component but from several compounds acting together additively or synergistically. With this approach, the doses of the mistletoe preparation are continually increased, depending on the patient's general condition, the extent of the local reaction at the site of injection and the regulation of body temperature. Some physicians also adjust the dosage, depending on certain immunological parameters. The preparations are usually applied by subcutaneous injection, two to three times a week.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Despite the existence of elaborated therapeutic concepts, numerous clinical studies and the experiences from a long and widespread use, there is considerable debate about the efficacy of this treatment modality (<LINK REF="REF-Cordier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansky 2002</LINK>). A recent editorial and the subsequent discussion vividly depicted that debate (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>). The existing reviews used different approaches to collect and appraise the evidence and varied in their interpretations of the data (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiene-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiene 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lange_x002d_Lindberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange-Lindberg 2006</LINK>). Therefore, we felt the need to systematically and comprehensively review the available evidence regarding the use of mistletoe extracts in the treatment of cancer patients.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of mistletoe extracts for prolonging survival, preventing recurrences, reducing treatment toxicity and/or improving QOL in patients with cancer.</P>
<P>Specifically:<BR/>(1) Do mistletoe extracts given alone or in combination with tumour-specific therapies prolong disease-free survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS)?<BR/>(2) Do mistletoe extracts given alone or in combination with tumour-specific therapies enhance tumour response?<BR/>(3) Do mistletoe extracts alleviate adverse effects from chemo- or radiotherapy?<BR/>(4) Do mistletoe extracts improve the QOL of cancer patients?<BR/>(5) Do mistletoe extracts produce adverse effects?</P>

<P>The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the criteria suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, the Delphi List (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>) and the approach of the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). All review authors participated in the assessment. Information on the quality of included studies is reported in the validity assessment table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Jadad scale consists of three items:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>one point is provided for randomisation, blinding, and description of withdrawals and drop-outs</LI>
<LI>two extra points are added for well-described and appropriate methods of randomisation and blinding</LI>
<LI>studies which use a clearly inappropriate method of randomisation or blinding (such as alternating patients) forfeit the respective point</LI>
<LI>studies which only state the numbers of withdrawn patients without reporting the reasons lose the respective point</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Thus the maximum obtainable score is five points and studies scoring below three points are usually regarded as being of low methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). For example the presentation in the validity assessment table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) reads as follows: 2-2-1 (full score for each item); 1-0-0 (randomisation only stated; no further details obtained).</P>
<P>The Delphi list has nine items where one point is provided if:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>words such as random and randomisation are used</LI>
<LI>the treatment allocation was concealed, meaning that an unpredictable assignment sequence was generated by an independent person not responsible for determining eligibility of the patients</LI>
<LI>the groups are regarded as similar in terms of prognostic indicators</LI>
<LI>the eligibility criteria were reported</LI>
<LI>patient, care provider and/or outcome assessor were adequately blinded (three points in total)</LI>
<LI>point estimates and measures of variability were presented</LI>
<LI>all randomised patients were analysed for the most important outcome measures, irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions</LI>
</UL>
<P>Thus the maximum obtainable score is nine points (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). For example the presentations in the validity assessment table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) reads as follows: 1-0-1-1-0-0-0-1-0 (randomisation stated; concealment of allocation unclear, relevant prognostic indicators evenly distributed between groups, criteria for in- and exclusion of patients reported, no blinding, estimates presented as medians with confidence intervals (CI), no intention-to-treat analysis).</P>
<P>For the definition of high methodological quality we used an arbitrary cut-off point of six out of nine fulfilled Delphi criteria, or four out of five fulfilled Jadad criteria.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of trials was also assessed with particular emphasis on the allocation concealment, which was ranked using the Cochrane Collaboration approach (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>):<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment<BR/>Grade D: Not used</P>
<P>Simple agreement and kappa statistics were applied to measure concordance among evaluators using the three scoring methods. Consensus on quality scores was established by discussion. No trial was excluded based on its quality score.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-02-10 22:10:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the strong clinical heterogeneity of the studies (range of mistletoe preparations, differences in dosage and application modes and concomitant conventional antineoplastic treatments, variation in patients' characteristics) and insufficient reporting it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis or to summarize the results of single studies in effect size measures. Therefore, the review findings had to be presented as a descriptive, narrative qualitative synthesis.</P>
<P>A rating system consisting of five levels of evidence was used (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>)<BR/>1. Strong evidence - consistent findings among multiple high quality RCTs<BR/>2. Moderate evidence - consistent findings among multiple low quality RCTs and/or one high quality RCT<BR/>3.

<P>Initially, several ratings for the fullfilment of methodological quality criteria for individual studies varied between review authors. Specifically, there were 38 disagreements on 294 individual ratings, for a raw agreement rate of 83%. A total of 24 of the disagreements resulted from different interpretations of the methodological quality items and the additional 14 resulted from reading errors in the studies. All disagreements were resolved through discussion among the review authors without the need for a third party.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation and concealment of allocation</HEADING>
<P>All of the included studies reported on random treatment allocation. Publications of 11 studies specified the method of sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK>), and in all of them we judged the method to allow for truly random allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK> reported matching after randomisation. In a personal correspondence the author stated, that there was no matching but a randomisation after stratification for sociodemographic factors. Methods to conceal allocation of treatment were reported in eight studies and in seven of them the concealment was jugded as adequate to prevent foreseement of assignement.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In principle, blinding of the patient and the care provider is problematic in trials with mistletoe extracts, as these extracts often evoke skin reaction at injection site.

<P>The mean Delphi score of all included studies was 4 with a median of 4 and a range of 1 to 6. The mean Jadad score was 2.6, with a median score of 3 and a range of one to 4. No study fulfilled all quality criteria in either one of the composite scales. Using an arbitrary cut-off point of 6 out of 9 fulfilled Delphi criteria, 4 of the 21 trials (19%) were of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK>). Applying the Jadad score as a measure for methodological quality and a cut-off point of 4 out of 5 fulfilled criteria, 3 of the 21 trials (14%) were of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>See scores and description of validity criteria of the single trials in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>From a clinical point of view, limitations of the majority of trials include a lack or insufficient description of prognostic relevant factors for the outcome of interest, staging not corresponding to international standards, outdated oncological treatment regimens, comparability of basic treatment (chemotherapy/radiotherapy) between groups being unclear, and a lack of control for equal provision of care apart from the treatment under evaluation.<BR/>

No episodes of leukopenia were found in patients who had received mistletoe extracts.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK> well-being and anxiety during chemotherapy were measured. For the assessment of well-being, four instruments were distributed (Befindlichkeitsskala, Beschwerdeliste, Eigenschaftswörterliste, FLIC) and the results of these instruments were merged into a 5-point scale named Index of well-being (Befindlichkeitsindex). Anxiety was measured with two instruments (Therapieangstskala and Catell-Angstskala) and the results were merged into a 10-point scale named the Index of anxiety (Angstindex). The authors did not report the methods of how the patient-reported outcomes were merged into the physician-rated indices. In patients receiving additional mistletoe extracts the physician-assessed index of well-being decreased from a mean of 4 (out of 5) at baseline to 2.8 after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, whereas in patients of the placebo group the mean index fell from 4 to 2 (measures of variability not reported; p &lt; 0.01, t-test). The mean values of the physician-assessed index of anxiety showed the following course in patients of the mistletoe group: 5 (out of 10) at baseline, 6 before second cycle of chemotherapy, 6 before 3rd, 5 before 4th, 4 before 5th, 4 before 6th and 4 at 10 days after completion of chemotherapy. The corresponding estimates in patients of the control group were: 5 at baseline, 6 before 2nd cycle: 6 before 3rd, 7 before 4th and 5th, and 7.5 before 6th and 7.5 at 10 days after completion of chemotherapy (no measures of variability; p &lt;/= 0.01, unclear which estimates were tested).</P>

The changes of the GLQ-8 sum score were combined with those of Spitzer's Uniscale (QLU) score by means of a nonparametric rank-sum (O'Brien) and tested for statistical significance. The changes from baseline to week 15 were found to be significantly different in patients from the medium and high dose mistletoe group compared with those who were treated with low dose mistletoe or placebo (p = 0.0035, O'Brien rank sum test). Pair-wise comparisons between placebo and each single mistletoe group revealed significance only for the medium dose mistletoe group (p = 0.007). For the medium dose mistletoe group, all changes in the 8 items of the GLQ-8 were larger than those in the placebo group. Significance was reached for changes in tiredness, sexual interest and anxiety related to treatment. For the results of the QLQ-C30 assessment, the authors reported no relevant difference without presenting data. An analysis of covariance, which had been carried out due to baseline inhomogeneities in the GLQ-8 and QLU score, revealed significant differences in week 15 between the medium dose mistletoe group and the placebo group for both measures (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0021 respectively).</P>

Although one group of patients received mistletoe extracts during radiotherapy (stratum B) data of the comparison between the mistletoe group and the control group were presented unstratified.

<P>In both of Grossarth et al's trials, psychosomatic self-regulation was assessed after three months of treatment with mistletoe extracts (<LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001b</LINK>). In patients with various types of cancer, mean score for self-regulation increased significantly within three months in the mistletoe group, whereas a decrease was found in the control group. The difference in the change in self-regulation values was statistically significant (p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney test) (<LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001a</LINK>). In patients with breast cancer, mean scores for self-regulation increased within three months from 2.92 at baseline to 3.70 in the mistletoe group (p = 0.01, Wilcoxon test) compared with an nonsignificant increase from 2.87 to 2.99 in the control goup.

<P>Twelve studies reported on side effects related to the treatment with mistletoe extracts (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luemmen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Luemmen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK>) All authors recorded local or systemic reactions, with the exception of one in which no patient experienced adverse effects of mistletoe extracts (<LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>). Local reactions were most commonly rubor, prurigo and induration at injection site, typical systemic reactions were mild fever and flue-like symptoms. Patients in Schwiersch's trial experienced no systemic side effects. Five patients in <LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 2004</LINK>, 1 in <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK> and 43 in <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK> discontinued mistletoe treatment due to adverse effects. In the <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK> trial they described one patient with angioedema and urticaria which was related to mistletoe application and recovered two days after discontinuation of study medication. In <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>, mistletoe extracts evoked reactions at injection site in 9% of patients of the low dose mistletoe group, in 18% of those who were in the medium dose mistletoe group, and in 32% of those treated with high doses.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-10 22:12:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aims of this review were to examine the outcomes of mistletoe therapy in patients with cancer in RCTs. The review includes data from 21 trials investigating the treatment of various malignancies with mistletoe extracts. The number and range of interventions and outcomes included in this review indicate the special situation surrounding cancer treatment with mistletoe extracts. The trials evaluated mistletoe preparations with different pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, varying compositions of ingredients, different dosage schedules, modes of application and durations of treatment and the authors measured a multiplicity of outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, there is a lack of independent duplication of studies investigating the same interventions which limits the strength of evidence and generalisability. Only two studies included matchable patient populations, used similar interventions and measured comparable outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Methodological Quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was described narratively (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) and assessed by means of three criteria lists (the Delphi list, the Jadad score and the Cochrane Collaboration approach). In this context, criteria lists do not define what quality entails and consists of, but rather they describe in a short and concise way which criteria regarding internal or external quality have been met. This way, they facilitate an oriented overview and classification of studies according to different criteria of methodological quality.</P>
<P>When applying the Jadad score one needs to consider that it was originally developed in order to appraise studies in pain research. This is one of the reasons why this instrument places a special value on the blinding of the intervention. In studies where unblinded administration does not have such a great influence on the results (for instance, in clinical studies assessing OS) the sole application of the Jadad score can lead to an underestimation of the methodological quality of studies. The Delphi list also assesses blinding of the intervention with two items and blinding of the outcome assessment with one item.</P>
<P>The assessment of the methodological quality of trials is always linked to its reporting quality, that is, the extent to which a publication reports on the design, conduct and analysis of a clinical trial. Although recent evidence suggested that the quality of RCTs of herbal medicine is superior to that of comparable trials of conventional medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Nartey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nartey 2007</LINK>), RCTs of herbal interventions have been found to report less than half of the required information as outlined by the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The eligible trials for this review varied in their design and quality and it was unfortunate that many studies reported data in an intransparent form. The use of structured abstracts and application of the CONSORT guidelines, to which only one study adhered to, would have improved the reporting quality considerably.</P>
<P>Though it is encouraging that 21 RCTs were available for review, we observed many methodological difficulties. Sample sizes were small (less than 100 patients) in 10 trials (48%), and bias could not be ruled out in the following percentages of included studies:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In 10 trials (48%) we could not rule out biases based on influences by the individuals carrying out the treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>In only three trials blinding of the care provider and the patient was reported. Given that in two of these studies a partial deblinding due to mistletoe-induced skin reactions was reported, the influence of participant or observer bias cannot be ruled out in nearly any of the included studies in which subjectively rated outcomes were assessed.</LI>
<LI>Only one trial explicitely reported blinding of the outcome assessor. Through blinding of the outcome assessor the influence of an assessment bias is being decreased. This regards, for instance, studies with tumour response as an investigator-rated outcome measure.</LI>
<LI>In only 9 of the 16 trials (56%) from which patients had dropped out or had no complete follow-up, we found remarks on the reasons for it. Moreover, it is noteworthy that especially in studies with small numbers of included patients the drop-out rates were low and that these studies often included patients with advanced disease stages, which usually are to be accounted for to contribute to a high number of drop-outs.</LI>
<LI>In 75% of the studies, in which mistletoe extracts were used during chemo- or radiotherapy (n = 12) it was not possible to judge whether the provision of these treatments was carried out equally.</LI>
</UL>
<P>While some of these problems are difficult to avoid (e.g., the problems with blinding) the quality of reporting of methodological and clinical details could easily be improved.</P>
<P>Concerning publication bias, several studies without positive results have been published and of the two unpublished trials, one reported benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Lange_x002d_Lindberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange-Lindberg 2006</LINK>) and the other did not (<LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Efficacy on survival</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there was no consistent effect of mistletoe extracts on DFS or OS for any of the included malignant diseases and for any of the applied preparations of mistletoe extracts.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.1. Breast Cancer</HEADING>
<P>For breast cancer the evidence that mistletoe extracts positively influence survival is limited and is based on one trial of 34 adult patients. Apart from other methodological shortcomings, particularly the lack of details on the treatment of patients of both the mistletoe and the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001b</LINK> constricts the informational value of the reported positive results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.2. Gastrointestinal cancer</HEADING>
<P>Concerning metastasized colorectal cancer there is conflicting evidence from two small trials that a treatment with mistletoe extracts given concomitantly to chemotherapy adds benefit in terms of survival (<LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK>, who reported benefits, used a preparation containing higher concentration of mistletoe compounds compared with <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>, who found no benefits, and in Douwes' trial mistletoe extracts were applied daily, whereas Heiny et al. applied them twice weekly. These differences between the interventional treatments notwithstanding, the effects reported in <LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK> should be interpreted with caution due to its small size and risk of bias.</P>
<P>Due to its low methodological quality, <LINK REF="STD-Cazacu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cazacu 2003</LINK> adds only limited evidence in that the addition of mistletoe extracts to the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer has a positive impact on survival. The comparison of Cazacu's results with other trials is furthermore hampered by the fact that the authors applied the study medication intravenously. Moreover, the poor survival of Dukes D patients treated with chemotherapy alone raises concerns about the influence of chemotherapy-related toxicity on the survival rates.</P>
<P>In patients with gastric cancer, mistletoe extracts were compared with chemotherapy or no treatment after surgery in one trial with 238 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1983</LINK>). In the first publication in 1979 a benefit in terms of survival in comparison with no treatment was reported, but the short follow-up period and the scant presentation of data without a statistical analysis impede a final conclusion. In the second publication of the trial in 1983, survival data were only presented for subgroups without the chemotherapy group and a benefit was reported only for the subgroup of patients with positive lymph-nodes. Based on these results, the evidence that patients with gastric cancer benefit from a postsurgical treatment with mistletoe extracts is weak.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.3. Lung cancer</HEADING>
<P>For non-small cell lung cancer there is limited to moderate evidence from two trials with 337 patients with inoperable lung-cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>) and with 183 patients after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1991</LINK>) that used mistletoe extracts have no significant effect concerning survival. It cannot be ruled out that the sample size in Dold's trial was too small to detect a realistic difference in survival (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 1992</LINK>), where a comparison with a sample size of 200 patients can only detect a 15-20% absolute survival difference, assuming a type I error of 5%, a power of 80% and a baseline survival function of 40% to 60%. Obviously, such differences are unrealistic in this type of disease. Consequently, even if a 5% to 10% absolute survival benefit was present, it would probably have been missed by the trial. In contrast, it cannot be ruled out that the results of the post-hoc analyses in <LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1991</LINK>, which suggested benefits for subgroups of patients, were spurious findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.4. Cancer of the urinary bladder, head and neck region and melanoma</HEADING>
<P>From three trials with high methodological quality there is moderate evidence suggesting that the used mistletoe extracts influence neither survival times nor recurrence rates in transurethrally resected urinary bladder cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>), resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region (<LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK>) and high risk melanoma after curative surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 2004</LINK>). Although these results stem from trials with higher methodological quality, one should be careful in generalizing the results to other mistletoe preparations or other forms of application and dosage of mistletoe extracts. Recent evidence from a phase I/II trial suggests that intravesical application of high-dose mistletoe extracts might be efficacious in the treatment of superficial urinary bladder cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Elsasser_x002d_Beile-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elsasser-Beile 2005</LINK>) and evidence from an observational study suggests that mistletoe extracts could prevent recurrences and prolong survival in patients with melanoma after curative surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Augustin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Augustin 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.5 Renal cell carcinoma</HEADING>
<P>There is limited evidence from one study with 176 patients with metastatic renal cell cancer showing that the treatment with mistletoe extracts was associated with a distinct but non-significant longer median survival compared to immunochemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Luemmen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Luemmen 2001</LINK>). This result could be ascribed to the treatment with mistletoe extracts (although virtually no tumour response was seen) or to an excess mortality due to toxicities of the immunochemotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.6. Malignant glioma</HEADING>
<P>Data of one trial with 38 patients receiving radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lenartz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lenartz 2000</LINK>) seem to suggest that the concomitant application of mistletoe extracts might prolong the DFS and OS. As the trial was poorly reported and we considered it to be at high risk of bias, the evidence that mistletoe extracts contribute to a prolongation of survival in glioma patients is weak.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.7. Various types of cancer</HEADING>
<P>Also the data of <LINK REF="STD-Grossarth-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Grossarth 2001a</LINK> adds little evidence that mistletoe extracts positively influence survival. Particularly the lack of details on the treatment of patients with various types of cancer of both the mistletoe and the control group limits the informational value of this trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. Efficacy on tumour response</HEADING>
<P>There is moderate evidence from two trials that mistletoe extracts have no beneficial influence on tumour response in lung cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>) and limited evidence that this is also the case in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Luemmen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Luemmen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For patients with advanced colorectal cancer, advanced stages of breast and ovarian cancer, there is contradictory evidence concerning an influence of mistletoe extracts on the tumour response (<LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">4. Efficacy on measures of QOL and of psychosocial distress</HEADING>
<P>When we analysed the studies that had investigated the influence of mistletoe extracts on QOL we found considerable heterogeneity between studies. Potential problems leading to this heterogeneity include: different types of instruments, no assessment before randomisation, lack of clarity whether measures were patient- or physician-rated. In addition to the possible biases from these methodological shortcomings, the timing of the assessment and the time scale of the chosen questionnaire were problematic. Since acute side effects of chemotherapy are usually expected within a few days of treatment it seems inappropriate to collect data three weeks later on the patient's next visit with questionnaires refering to symptoms during the previous week.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4.1. Treatment during chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Multidimensional scales measuring health-related QOL were used in 10 studies. From two studies, there is weak evidence that mistletoe extracts positively impact QOL during palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>), and advanced colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>). In both trials sample sizes were small, and the lack of care provider and patient blinding opened the results to the influence of bias. Furthermore, in <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>, it was not clear, whether the outcomes were patient- or physician-rated.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK> compared mistletoe extracts with Lentinan. This study was designed as an approval trial for the mistletoe extract and the Chinese health authorities ordered lentinan, a biologic response modifier, to act as a control treatment for this study. As the direction of effect of lentinan on QOL is unclear, the positive effects of mistletoe extracts compared to lentinan cannot be definitely attributed to the mistletoe therapy. Also in this unblinded study it was not clear, whether the outcomes were patient- or physician-rated.</P>
<P>From three other studies, there is conflicting evidence, that mistletoe extracts may positively influence health related QOL during adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>). In Auerbach's small and unblinded pilot trial (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>, no changes in the QLQ-C30 questionnaire were detected, whereas in both of Semiglasov's trials, significant improvements were reported in health-related QOL as measured by the GLQ. In <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK> this positive effect, however, was limited to that patient group, which received mistletoe extracts in a medium dose. This dose was also used in the follow-up study (<LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>). In both studies, the absolute changes of the outcome measures were small, however, many investigators found that, for a variety of scales assessing overall QOL, changes between 5% and 10% were noticed by patients and were regarded by them as significant changes. Though Semiglasov's trials were the only ones with a double-blind study design, authors reported that the mistletoe-evoked skin reactions led to a substantial percentage of unblinding of the intervention treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>From Lange's small and unpublished pilot trial there is limited evidence that mistletoe extracts have beneficial effects on tumor-related pain (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1993</LINK>). But in this study the effect size was also small and the intervention unblinded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4.2. Treatment after chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>From one trial with 30 patients, there is evidence that women with metastatic breast cancer benefit in terms of QOL and anxiety from a three-month treatment with mistletoe extracts after completion of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 1999</LINK>). As the intervention was not blinded and the number of patients was small, we considered the trial at risk of bias and the evidence that mistletoe extracts contribute to an increase in QOL and a decrease of measures of anxiety in this setting as limited. Furthermore, it was not clear, whether the subjective outcomes were patient-reported or physician-rated.</P>
<P>From another trial with 151 breast cancer patients in a rehabilitation setting after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>), there is evidence that a four-week treatment with mistletoe extracts had no significant impact on disease specific aspects of stress (FBK) and overall QOL (SF-36). Nevertheless, in this unpublished study, there were significant changes in the vitality subscale of the SF-36 in the mistletoe group. As the outcome assessments were conducted after a very short treatment period and the influence of the non-reported concomitant rehabilitation program on the subjective outcomes were unclear, also the evidence about the effects of mistletoe extracts in this setting remains unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4.3. Treatment during radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>In malignant glioma, one small study reported a benefit concerning QOL when patients were treated with mistletoe extracts during radiation (<LINK REF="STD-Lenartz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lenartz 2000</LINK>). As mentioned above, this study has many methodogical flaws and a poor reporting quality, therefore the evidence for a benefit due to a treatment with mistletoe extracts is weak.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4.4. Sole mistletoe treatment</HEADING>
<P>There is limited to moderate evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK> that patients with head and neck-cancer did not benefit from a treatment with constantly dosed mistletoe extracts in their QOL. From a methodological point of view, one has to criticize that the intervention in this study was not blinded, and thus principally the influence of a participant bias on the results could not be ruled out. However, if in this study measures of QOL were influenced by a participant bias, a benefit in favour of the intervention group would have been expected. Unfortunately, the results of the QOL analysis were so poorly presented that no further statement can be made regarding the course of the assessed parameters.</P>
<P>From one trial with 337 patients there is limited evidence that patients with advanced lung carcinoma benefit in their overall well-being from a treatment with mistletoe extracts (<LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>). However, results from this trial also add limited evidence that a treatment with mistletoe extracts did not alleviate disease-related symptoms. The evidence was judged as limited for both outcomes, as the assessment was done by the physician and the provision of care was unblinded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">5. Efficacy on adverse effects of radio-/chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of efficacy of mistletoe extracts for chemo- or radiotherapy induced adverse effects is only possible to a limited extent due to the low methodological quality with which the outcome parameters were reported. Authors of five studies stated lower rates of chemotherapy related adverse effects in the mistletoe group without presenting further data (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cazacu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cazacu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>)<BR/>
<BR/>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK> seem to suggest that organ toxicities of chemotherapy might increase depending on the dose of the used mistletoe extracts. Compared with the low and medium dose mistletoe group and the placebo group, patients in the high dose mistletoe group experienced higher rates of adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract and on red blood cells.</P>
<P>The results from Lange's unpublished trial give limited evidence that variably dosed mistletoe extracts diminish symptoms from radiochemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1993</LINK>). Although the authors assessed symptoms on a daily basis, the unblinded application of the study medication opened the results to bias. Furthermore, the absolute changes of the outcome measures were small.</P>
<P>Although Heiny et al. stated a significant difference in the incidence of mucositis between the groups, the corresponding table listed a p-value of 0.321 (<LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>). Edler even disclosed a calculation error in this piece of work and corrected the p-value for the duration of the mucositis from 0.033 to 0.64 (<LINK REF="REF-Edler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edler 2004</LINK>). Collectively, the low methodological quality of the study prevents the drawing of any reliable conclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">6. Safety of mistletoe extracts</HEADING>
<P>From twelve studies there is moderate evidence that mistletoe extracts are usually well tolerated and have only few side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dold-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dold 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goebell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goebell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luemmen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Luemmen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Semiglasov-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Semiglasov 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steuer_x002d_Vogt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Steuer-Vogt 2001</LINK>). Depending on the dose, local reactions with rubor, prurigo and induration at injection site occur in up to one third of patients, as well as systemic reactions with mild fever and flue-like symptoms in 10%. Severe, life-threatening symptoms were rare events. There is no evidence from RCTs that mistletoe extracts negatively impact survival in cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Eggermont-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eggermont 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiene-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiene 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 2001</LINK>). As RCTs, however, often do not suffice to detect adverse effects, reviews must go beyond the data from RCTs and include such from observational studies in order to reliably appraise the safety of mistletoe extracts.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2003</LINK> addressed the question of the safety and effectiveness of mistletoe extracts in cancer treatment. We found inconsistencies in this review between the numbers of trials that were included and from which the authors presented results. Though the authors claimed a comprehensive search strategy, they missed three published studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luemmen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Luemmen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1983</LINK>) and two unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>). The authors were using the criteria suggested by Jadad for assessment, however for their review they fail to define the cut-off points between good and mediocre methodological quality. When discussing the safety of mistletoe extracts, the authors presented prevalence rates of low grade adverse effects linked with a list of severe ones. Through this, the review suggested a bad tolerability of mistletoe extracts, which did not comply with the data from the included RCTs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003a</LINK> also addressed the question of safety and effectiveness of mistletoe extracts in cancer and reported a comprehensive search strategy. They failed to include one published study (<LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 1999</LINK>). According to their inclusion criteria, also studies with quasi-random allocation of treatment and non-randomised, prospective trials were included. Compared to our review, the following differences exist regarding inclusion of studies: <LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003a</LINK> did not include unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwiersch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwiersch 1999</LINK>), but three trials, which were excluded from our review: A small study with lung cancer patients, scantily reported in a bookchapter (<LINK REF="STD-Salzer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Salzer 1987</LINK>), a quasi-randomised study with breast cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-G_x00fc_nczler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Günczler 1971</LINK>) and one further study with breast cancer patients in which randomisation had failed (<LINK REF="STD-G_x00fc_nczler-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Günczler 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gutsch-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gutsch 1988</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Jach-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jach 2003</LINK>, which was included in Kienle's review, women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were treated, which is a precancerous condition but not cancer. This was the reason why this study was not included in our review. <LINK REF="REF-Kienle-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienle 2003a</LINK> evaluated the internal and external validity of studies according to an extensive list of criteria. The influence of bias on the trials' results were comprehensively discussed. However, their critical verdict that only a few studies were reasonably well conducted was incomprehensible, since the authors neither stated how they defined reasonably well, nor which studies fulfilled their definition.</P>
<P>A recently published health technology assessment (HTA) addressed the question of the potential of mistletoe extracts in alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy and on QOL during chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lange_x002d_Lindberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange-Lindberg 2006</LINK>). The authors confined their comprehensive literature search to RCTs and found eight eligible trials (six published and 2 unpublished), of which all are also included in our systematic review. However, Lange-Lindberg et al. missed one published trial that should have been included (<LINK REF="STD-Douwes-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Douwes 1986a</LINK>) and did not take into account the most recent publication from Auerbach's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 2005</LINK>). The authors of the HTA concluded that the evidence is insufficient to reliably appraise the question whether mistletoe extracts could be helpful in diminishing the side effects of chemotherapy but that there is some evidence that mistletoe extracts standardized for the content of mistletoe lectin could have beneficial effects on the QOL of breast cancer patients during chemotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">8. Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>The strength of this systematic review lies in the wide-ranging literature search and the comprehensive assessment and reporting of all clinical outcomes evaluated in the included studies.</P>
<P>The qualitative analysis used here may be regarded as a strength and a drawback at the same time. That is, although it would have been incorrect to statistically combine data from a sample of such heterogeneous trials, the qualitative method used does not provide information on the size of the treatment effect.</P>
<P>The conclusiveness of this review is limited by the small sample size and methodological shortcoming in the majority of included studies. Apart from the often low methodological quality, three issues particularly limited our ability to interprete the data. One was the clinical heterogeneity of the included patients which impeded the grouping of study data. The second was the lack of comparability with current treatment situations due to outdated or unusual methods of cancer treatment and diagnosis. The third limitation was the pharmaceutical heterogeneity in the applied mistletoe extracts, and the varying dosages and modes of application.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The majority of the included trials reported benefits for patients treated with mistletoe extracts in one or more outcome measures. However, most trials were found to have major methodological drawbacks that raise doubts about the validity and generalizability of the findings and there is no clear evidence for the superiority of one preparation or treatment schedule over another. Therefore, based on the results of RCTs, the evidence is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for the use of mistletoe extracts in oncological practice and it does not support mandatory use of mistletoe extracts. </P>
<P>Safety data indicate that, depending on the dose, mistletoe extracts are usually well tolerated and have only few adverse effects. Although they comprise rare events, caution is advised to allergic reactions and care should be taken to monitor signs of systemic immune stimulation like fever and chills. </P>
<P>Decisions about whether mistletoe extracts are likely to be effective and safe for a particular problem as well as the mode of use must rely on expert judgement and practical considerations. This should be discussed with patients before they give their consent and where possible, patients should be offered entry into well-designed clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the widespread use of mistletoe extracts for cancer patients, the small number of informative trials for some tumour entities, and the limited evidence concerning effects of different mistletoe extracts on clinical relevant outcomes, there is a need for good quality independent clinical evaluation of this treatment modality. It is imperative that trials with positive outcomes should be repeated by other research groups and in different settings. </P>
<P>Concerning the design of future studies with mistletoe extracts the following issues should be taken into account:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the results of two trials suggesting beneficial effects of mistletoe extracts on QOL of breast cancer patients during chemotherapy need independent replication;</LI>
<LI>the results of some trials give reasonable evidence that the used mistletoe extracts are not effective for the purpose for which they have been used; </LI>
<LI>the availability of mistletoe extracts and their wide-spread use in cancer patients, especially in German-speaking countries, impede the recruitment of controlled clinical trials in this field and expose the trial to the risk of bias through contamination of the control group;</LI>
<LI>compliance and/or contamination could be controlled by measuring the formation of mistletoe-lectin antibodies;</LI>
<LI>the lectin content of the investigational mistletoe extracts should be specified in the publications;</LI>
<LI>treatment schedules adjusted to the individual's local and systemic reaction, which are recommended by some manufacturers, cannot be properly blinded;</LI>
<LI>the context variables between different forms of mistletoe therapy (i.e. anthroposophical, phytomedical) vary in clinical practice and should be considered in future study designs;</LI>
<LI>better reporting of study methods, targeted outcomes, characteristics of participants and interventions is needed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, authors should bear in mind that positive or negative results obtained with a specific mistletoe preparation or application schedule in a defined type of cancer cannot be extrapolated to "mistletoe therapy" in general.</P>

The respective scores of the control group were 18.06 at screening, 17.88 at day 0, 15.27 after 2 weeks, 14.93 after 4 weeks and 15.64 at follow-up after 8 weeks. The differences between groups were not significant (p=0.72, t-test, ANCOVA).<BR/>No significant differences between the groups were found in the overall analysis of the questionnaire on life satisfaction (FLZ). Details were only reported for two subscales of the FLZ: The scores of the FLZ subscale 'ability to relax' (range -16 to 20, higher values indicate the ability to better relax) in patients of the mistletoe group were 0.5 at day 0 of the study, 3.74 after 4 weeks, and 2.07 at follow-up after 8 weeks. The respective scores of the control group were 1.52 at day 0, 3.6 after 4 weeks and 2.57 at follow-up after 8 weeks. The differences were not significant, measures of variability not reported. The scores of the FLZ subscale 'energy/joie de vivre' (range -16 to 20, higher values indicate higher energy) in patients of the mistletoe group were 3.2 at day 0 of the study, 6.67 after 4 weeks, and 4.31 at follow-up after 8 weeks. The respective scores of the control group were 4.42, 5.65, and 4.89 (p=0.025, t-test, ANCOVA). The analysis of the questionnaires B-L, MDBF, SCL-90R, and of performance index (Karnofsky) revealed no significant differences between groups. No significant differences were found in the overall analysis of the questionnaire SF-36, but for the subscale 'vitality', significant higher values are found in the mistletoe group (no details presented).</P>

<BR/>Feedback: Comment on: Mistletoe therapy in oncology (Cochrane-Review 2008)<BR/>(Horneber MA, Bueschel G, Huber R, Linde K, Rostock M: Mistletoe in oncology (Review). 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd)<BR/>
<BR/>The Cochrane-Review 'Mistletoe therapy in oncology' (2008) concludes that the available evidence is not sufficient to support mandatory administration of mistletoe therapy. This summation will no doubt generally find agreement. However, the additional conclusion that trial evidence is generally weak requires critical examination.<BR/>
<BR/>The Cochrane-Review is neither complete nor updated, the formal evaluation procedure is inadequate, and the factual assessments are not consistent and often incorrect. Appropriate correction of the assessments leads to a different overall picture of the mistletoe trials. (For details see www.mistel-therapie.de).<BR/>
<BR/>How complete and updated is the Cochrane-Review?<BR/>The Cochrane-Review covers 21 randomized trials (RCTs). One HTA report and two system-atic reviews are also discussed.<BR/>The following relevant publications were not taken into account: 9 RCTs investigating survival time, tumour behaviour and quality of life; 1 re-analysis of an RCT; 1 meta-analysis; 1 systematic review; 1 HTA report. The publications are distributed as follows:<BR/>
<BR/>- published 1987 [1]: 1 RCT<BR/>- published 1999 [2]: 1 RCT<BR/>- published 2005 [3]: 1 RCT<BR/>- published 2006 [4-7]: 1 RCT, 1 re-Analysis of an RCT, 1 HTA report<BR/>- published 2007 [8-12]: 5 RCTs und 1 systematic review<BR/>- published 2008 [13]: 1 meta-analysis.<BR/>(For further details, see www.mistel-therapie.de)<BR/>
<BR/>The Cochrane-Review is therefore incomplete and outdated.<BR/>
<BR/>The formal procedure for evaluation of study quality The procedure chosen for evaluation of study quality in this Cochrane-Review is inadequate:<BR/>A number of formal evaluation scores are available. Different scores yield different results when applied to identical studies (see e.g. [14]). The Cochrane-Review employs two scores (the Jadad score and the Delphi list) which give the greatest weight to blinding of the study intervention: blinding is allocated 2 points (40%) of the maximum 5 Jadad points, and 3 points (30%) of the maximum 9 Delphi points. By selecting these particular evaluation scales, a poor performance of the mistletoe trials was predetermined, irrespective of how good or bad they actually are. The reason is: Subcutaneous mistletoe injections regularly cause painful swelling and reddening. Therefore, in principle, this therapy cannot be blinded. When blind-ing is attempted, unblinding certainly occurs. (This has been repeatedly investigated and con-firmed in clinical trials. For this reason many mistletoe trials refrain from using pro-forma blinding.) Consequently, the Cochrane-Review disqualifies all mistletoe trials on this point, including the trials formally conducted as double-blind trials. But the dilemma is not men-tioned: Namely that trials investigating subcutaneous mistletoe therapy will, in principle, per-form poorly in the evaluation scores used by the Cochrane-Review (because blinding is im-possible). The formal evaluation procedure chosen for this review is therefore inadequate.<BR/>
<BR/>It may be inconvenient that mistletoe therapy is so incompatible with blinding. However, the same problem arises with other therapy forms such as physiotherapy, surgery and psychother-apy. It would be absurd if all these treatments should be disqualified a priori. The Cochrane-Review should have at least acknowledged that the evaluation procedure did not allow for mistletoe studies to be classified as a high-quality research. Furthermore, the general requirement of blinding (of patient, physician and observer) has bi-zarre consequences: It assumes, amongst other things, that a physician can only reliably de-termine a patient's time of death if he or she does not know whether the patient received mis-tletoe therapy or not (i.e. is blinded).<BR/>
<BR/>Inconsistencies in evaluation<BR/>For evaluation of study quality, cut-off values were set arbitrarily. Following the subtraction of 'blinding points' mentioned above, no mistletoe trial could perform positively on the Jadad score, and on the Delphi list the subtraction of one additional point was sufficient for the trial to receive a poor quality rating. Therefore the remaining methodological evaluations require particular accuracy and balancing Furthermore, errors, lack of transparency, subjective ten-dencies, lack of recourse to the author of the trial etc. can quickly and unjustly tip the balance towards a positive or negative trial rating.<BR/>
<BR/>Thus the question arises as to why, in the Cochrane Review, the trials with negative results (i.e. no superiority of mistletoe therapy over the control group) were so positively evaluated, and why the weaknesses of these studies, in part severe limitations, were not presented or dis-cussed. And why, on the other hand, trials with positive results (i.e. where mistletoe therapy was superior) were disqualified sometimes with regard to aspects which they dealt with equally well or better than the trials with negative results. Or why trials with positive results were disqualified because some study features were not clearly described in the primary pub-lication, when the respective features were described in a secondary publication or trial report, or could have been identified by contacting the study authors.<BR/>
<BR/>These issues will be illustrated with the following examples:<BR/>Example 1: Handling of drop-outs in the Piao (2004) [15] und Steuer-Vogt (2001) [16;17] trials.<BR/>Assessment in the Cochrane-Review: The Piao trial, which shows superiority of mistletoe therapy, is criticised on the following grounds that not all patients completed the trial ('drop-outs' are ubiquitous in almost all clinical trials), that according to the Cochrane review, the reason for the drop-outs was not mentioned, that the number of drop-outs was unbalanced in the two groups, and that these drop-outs were not part of the trial evaluation. In contrast, the Steuer-Vogt trial, where mistletoe therapy showed no superiority, received a plus point with respect to drop-outs.<BR/>The facts:<BR/>1.) Both studies were evaluated according to the intention-to-treat-principle, i.e. all patients were evaluated as if they actually received the treatment assigned by randomization, inde-pendently of whether this actually was the case or not. This is the contemporary standard evaluation technique.<BR/>2.) Furthermore, the drop-out rate in the Piao trial was only 4%. This rate is so marginal that any influence of dropout on the trial result would appear to be theoretical. In the Steuer-Vogt trial, the drop-out rate for survival was 9%; for quality of life, it was 32% and 53% after one and two years, respectively. In fact, the Piao study states the reasons for drop-outs very clearly (presented in a biometric trial report available on the Internet). In the Steuer-Vogt trial, however, the dropouts are for the most parts not even listed separately for the mistletoe and control groups. Therefore, contrary to the Cochrane-Review's statements, 'balance' of drop-outs in the two groups of the Steuer-Vogt trial cannot be assessed at all.<BR/>The Cochrane-Review criticises the Piao trial for failure to include data of excluded patients in the quality of life evaluation. This does not make sense: quality of life can only be evalu-ated for available questionnaires, as opposed to outcomes such as survival time, time of death and tumour behaviour which can also be assessed outside of trial participation. In the litera-ture this problem is well-known and is still unsolved (see e.g. [18;19]). Therefore, there is no convincing factual basis for an a priory disqualification of the Piao trial in this respect. More-over, the same problem is also present in the Steuer-Vogt trial: With regard to the trial's pri-mary outcome measure, a subset of the drop-outs (namely 4%: 495 randomized, 477 assessed) was also not included in the analyses, although this would have been technically possible in contrast to Piao's 4%. Furthermore, the 32% and 53% drop-out-rate concerning quality of life were not considered in the respective analyses of the Steuer-Vogt trial.<BR/>In conclusion: With regard to handling of dropouts, the Steuer-Vogt trial is definitely not superior to the Piao trial. At best, the two trials are comparable in this respect but under close scrutiny the Steuer-Vogt trial clearly comes off worse because of its high dropout rates for quality of life assessment. Nonetheless, the Steuer-Vogt trial receives a plus point in this regard and the Piao trial a minus point. This is not in accordance with the factual data and creates an impression of biased assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>Example 2: Assessment of prognostic comparability in the Grossarth (2001a/b) [20;21] and Kleeberg (2004) [22] trials.<BR/>Assessment in the Cochrane-Review: The assessment of comparability of trial groups regard-ing prognostic factors results in a minus point for the Grossarth trials (that show superiority of mistletoe therapy), in contrast to a plus point for the Kleeberg trial (no superiority).<BR/>The facts:<BR/>In the breast cancer trial by Grossarth, the patients (Mamma Ca., N&gt;1, M=O) were matched systematically into pairs according to stage (IIIA and IIIB), menopause status, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, age, and year of first diagnosis; the other Grossarth trial applied similar matching criteria. Accordingly, patients were comparable concerning these prognostic parameters. After matching had been completed, each patient in a matched and comparable pair was randomized to either mistletoe or control group. It is inexplicable why the Cochrane-Review assessed comparability of these studies as not guaranteed.<BR/>The Kleeberg trial, on the other hand, had marked differences in gender distribution: Women were clearly under-represented in the mistletoe group (35.6% of patients) compared to the control group (46.5%), a relevant difference for survival time. For example, among patients in Stage IIb (half of the study patients: 49% and 48% respectively), women had a highly signifi-cant better survival (p=0.0009) than men. This uneven gender distribution between mistletoe and control groups disadvantages the mistletoe group. If the imbalance had been taken into account in the final multivariate analyses, a positive result for survival time in the mistletoe group might have occurred.<BR/>In conclusion: Regarding comparability of prognostic factors, the Kleeberg trial is not at all superior to the Grossarth trial. In fact, the Kleeberg trial shows a markedly uneven distribu-tion relevant for survival time. It is inexplicable why the Kleeberg trial received a plus point and the Grossarth trial a minus point in this respect. This assessment creates an impression of bias.<BR/>
<BR/>Example 3: Blinding in the Borrelli (1999) [23] and Dold (1991) [24] trials Assessment in the Cochrane-Review: In the Borrelli trial (which showed superiority of mis-tletoe therapy), according to Dr. Borrelli (first author), the physicians and patients were blinded towards mistletoe therapy. Nevertheless the trial was evaluated as 'not blinded'.<BR/>On the other hand, in the Dold trial (which shows no superiority of mistletoe therapy concern-ing tumour remission and survival time) the physicians and patients were not blinded towards mistletoe therapy this trial was devised and conducted as a non-blinded placebo-controlled trials. Yet, the Cochrane-Review allocates the Dold trial a plus point in the Delphi list regard-ing 'adequate blinding of patients'. This is inexplicable.<BR/>Furthermore, according to the Cochrane review's description of the Dold trial, there was sup-posedly a genuine blinding of the 'outcome assessor'. This claim also does not reflect the facts: The trial report states that the physicians were not blinded, and that these (not blinded) physicians collected the outcome data and entered them into the case report forms.<BR/>
<BR/>Further inconsistencies<BR/>Grossarth trials [20;21], Borrelli trial [23]: The Cochrane-Review subtracts a quality point for each of these trials because randomization was not concealed. Allocation concealment is intended to prevent the physicians enrolling patients from guessing or estimating the group to which each patient will be randomized, knowledge of which could lead to manipulation of patient enrolment. The fact is, however: In the Borrelli trial randomization was carried out by an independent person who had no contact with the enrolling physicians (= definition crite-rion for 'concealment' according to the Delphi list). In the Grossarth trials each unit to be randomized (the matched patient pair) was already fully included in the trial before randomi-zation. Because randomization took place after enrolment had been completed, randomization was certainly concealed from the personnel enrolling patients. Therefore subtracting a point for supposed lack of concealment of allocation was indisputably incorrect for the Borrelli trial and at least questionable regarding the Grossarth trials.<BR/>
<BR/>In addition, the Cochrane-Review claims that in the Grossarth trials it is unclear whether the patients had consented to participation. The fact is: All patients were informed about the trial. (Consent to participate in the study was assumed after comprehensive information about the study objectives and the study design and the patient's explicit expression of willingness to participate [4]. Randomization procedures were carried out according to Zelen's Random-ized Consent Design.) The Cochrane-Review restricted inclusion criteria to randomized trials. This limitation is not without problems, as can be seen with the Grossarth trials: Both Grossarth RCTs considered in the Cochrane-Review (as well as other mistletoe RCTs by Grossarth) are part of a large epidemiological cohort study comprising approximately 10,000 patients, within which several large prospective matched-pair studies are embedded [4;5;8-10;13;20;25]. RCTs normally have a very limited external validity, i.e. they provide very little evidence of the effectiveness of a therapy in practice. For example, RCTs encompass highly selected patients (mostly less than 1% of the relevant diagnosis group [26]), they exclude the most relevant concomitant diseases; and RCTs differ markedly from real-world treatment conditions with respect to di-agnosis, therapy, adjunctive therapies and follow-up [26;27]. The Grossarth cohort study, on the other hand, is characterised by an extremely high external validity. The study does not interfere with the therapy, nor does it intervene in the natural course of treatment with exten-sive study documentation and diagnostic procedures. In this way, the Grossarth study enables a comprehensive and undistorted evaluation of the patients' treatment under everyday clinical conditions. These features are combined with other design elements to assess and strengthen the internal validity (that is, the highest possible distortion-free therapy evaluation), by em-bedding a number of smaller RCTs within this larger cohort study. Thus Grossarth achieves what almost all experimental trials are incapable of: to maximise internal and external validity within a single research project. This achievement is lost when single embedded RCTs are isolated and assessed independently from their research context, as in the Cochrane-Review. In this respect the Cochrane Review represents a reductionistic tunnel vision that does not enable any realistic evaluation of the Grossarth studies.<BR/>
<BR/>Against this background, the Cochrane-Review's statement that lack of detailed information about the therapies provided would limit the informational value of the Grosarth RCTs is also put into perspective. Although the trials do not provide any information as to whether, for example, Iscador A or Iscardor M is more effective for a particular indication, or whether mis-tletoe dosage should be increased rapidly or slowly, they do assess the question of whether mistletoe therapy administered in regular clinical settings has any benefit at all. Similarly, the Cochrane-Review summary concludes with a global analysis and does not differentiate ac-cording to mistletoe host tree and dosage. The Grossarth trials were also criticised for the lack of detailed information about adjunct therapies administered apart from the investigational therapy, but this represents customary practice in clinical trials. Similarly, in the Kleeberg or Steuer-Vogt trials, there is no documentation on therapies administered apart from the trial therapy, although one can assume that the patients did receive other therapies in the time span from surgery to death.<BR/>
<BR/>Piao trial (2004) [15]: If blinding is not reliably possible, an active, effective therapy is a rea-sonable and well-established alternative for the control group. This may lead to an underesti-mation of the effects of the test therapy, which would not be in conflict with the prevailing conservative attitude in clinical research. This solution was adopted in the Piao trial. In the Cochrane-Review, however, the use of active control therapy was not acknowledged as a rea-sonable alternative: the therapy benefit of mistletoe extracts was deemed unassessable since the effects of the control therapy (Lentinan) were unclear. This statement is not quite cor-rect because a number of clinical trials on Lentinan are available.<BR/>
<BR/>Gutsch trial (1988) [28]: This trial was excluded from the Cochrane-Review because of a putative randomization error. However, no such error is reported in the publication by Gutsch; instead protocol violations are described, i.e. the allocated therapy was not administered to all patients. This occurs frequently in clinical trials. (For this reason analyses are mostly made according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol; Gutsch analysed as treated [29]). Therefore this trial should have been included as an RCT.<BR/>Kienle-Review (2003) [30]: According to the Cochrane Review, Kienle 2003 'failed to' in-clude two unpublished trials, Lange 1993 and Schwiersch 1999. The fact is: 'Unpublished' was an exclusion criterion for the Kienle Review from 2003. Furthermore, Kienle was said to have also failed to include Borrelli's published trial. This is true for Kienle 2003 but not for Kienle's HTA-report of 2006 [6;7] and the Kienle Review from 2007 [12]. According to the Cochrane Review, Kienle 2003 also mistakenly included the above-mentioned Gutsch trial as an RCT; in fact, however, this trial was indeed an RCT. Kienle is said to have included Sal-zer 1987 twice: Once as a randomized trial and once as a non-randomized trial. The fact is: Two different trials were involved here, concerning bronchial carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively. The Cochrane-Review is also of the opinion that the trial described in the Kienle Review 2003 as Salzer 1987 is identical to Gutsch 1988 (in the Cochrane-Review also described as Gunczler 1974). This is also incorrect: Neither is Gutsch 1988 identical with the RCT of bronchial carcinoma, nor with the quasi-randomized trial for breast carci-noma which was carried out before the Gutsch trial. The randomized trial of bronchial carci-noma in question was overlooked by the Cochrane Review and not included.<BR/>
<BR/>Further issues<BR/>The Cochrane Review has a substantial number of other errors of details, but not every prob-lematic aspect can be dealt with here.<BR/>All non-randomized trials were excluded a priori, which is questionable since tumour re-sponse to mistletoe therapy was an explicit outcome parameter in the Cochrane Review and since tumour remission has been far more thoroughly investigated and represented in the non-randomized trials than in the randomized trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Strangely, the decision to conduct this Cochrane Review is described as resulting from discrepancies between earlier reviews (e.g. Kienle 2003 [30], Ernst 2003 [31], Lange-Lindberg 2006 [32]), whereas the protocol for the Cochrane Review was already available in the Cochrane Library long before these reviews were accessible.<BR/>
<BR/>Overall picture of mistletoe trials<BR/>When the criticism against the Cochrane Review presented here is taken fully into account, a different overall picture of the mistletoe trials emerges.<BR/>
<BR/>While most of the trials have strengths and weaknesses to varying extent, as is the case with other clinical trials, there are indeed a number carefully conducted trials (Furthermore, the mistletoe trials with a negative result, ranked as 'high quality' by the Cochrane Review have ' in part substantial ' quality deficiencies not discussed in the Review. See further details at www.mistel-therapie.de or [33]). Currently, the best evidence of mistletoe effects concerns improvement of quality of life and improved tolerance of conventional oncological therapies. Survival benefit from mistletoe therapy has been found in many trials, but not beyond cri-tique. Tumour remissions have been reported, often in detail, in non-randomized trials, and seem to depend on the type of administration and dosage of mistletoe extracts.<BR/>
<BR/>Hopefully the evidence base will be further broadened by future trials. However, 'high quality' trials are frequently called for, but their practical implementation is subject to consider-able difficulties. Due to huge bureaucratic hurdles today, industry-independent trials are hardly feasible. (The cost per clinical RCT in the USA have been estimated at US$ 12 million [34]). In Germany larger trials for mistletoe therapy are almost infeasible because of recruit-ment problems and randomization refusals. For this reason, trials have to be conducted in other countries. Blinding poses problems discussed above. Nonetheless, mistletoe therapy is subject to vigorous research activities, the number of clinical trials has increased markedly in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue in the future.<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-02-11 11:37:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We would like to thank Kienle &amp; Kiene for their comments on the review. We have considered their points carefully. The cited trials and reviews will be assessed among others in the upcoming update of the review. This update was already planned as the review was first published in the Cochrane Library. In this update, the assessment of risk of bias will be done according to the new approach of the Cochrane Collaboration. This approach relies neither on a scale nor a checklist, but on a 'domain-based evaluation', in which the assessments are made separately for different domains and outcomes (see Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions).</P>
<P>Concerning the assessment of the validity of findings of clinical trials within a systematic review, we are aware to the fact that such an assessment always involves a certain degree of subjectivity. Nevertheless, we reject the allegation of double standards in the appraisal of the included studies in our review.</P>
<P>The informative value of our review is limited by the fact that the majority of the included trials have restricted internal and/or external validity. We will change the conclusions of our review, if we find conclusive reasons for it. The points which Kienle &amp; Kiene raised were insufficient for it and did not convince us.</P>
<P>To address some of Kienle &amp; Kiene&#8217;s specific comments:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8217;That the following publications were not taken into account&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Cited reference [1]</B>: Salzer G. 30 Jahre Erfahrung mit der Misteltherapie an öffentlichen Krankenanstalten. In: Leroi R, editor. Misteltherapie. Eine Antwort auf die Herausforderung Krebs. Stuttgart: Verlag Freies Geistesleben, 1987: 173-215.</P>
<P>This reference relates to a book chapter in which experiences with and results of clinical investigations with mistletoe extracts from the 1960ies to the 80ies were narratively reported and supplemented with few table data and figures. On page 179 of this book chapter a trial with breast cancer patients is mentioned that was initiated in 1971 and in which the treatment was allocated in a quasi-random manner. This trial was listed in the review as Günczler 1971 and excluded. On page 180 a second randomised trial with breast cancer patients is mentioned ("<I>1974 wurde eine neue, prospektive, randomisierte Studie operierter Mammakarzinome (...) auf breiter Basis gestartet. (...) Bis 1978 wurden 724 Fälle randomisiert und eine erste Zwischenbilanz im Sommer 1979 gezogen</I>.&#8220;)<I> </I>which was analysed and published by J. Gutsch (page 181: "<I>1985 hat J. Gutsch in Zusammenarbeit mit der statistischen Abteilung der Universität Witten-Herdecke (G. Scholz) eine Schlußbilanz dieser Arbeit gezogen (20).</I>"). This trial was listed in the review as Günczler 1974 and Gutsch 1988 and excluded because J. Gutsch affirmed in a personal communication that the random allocation to the treatment groups had failed which he already had reported in the publication (Gutsch 1988). The initiators of this study (G. Salzer and M. Günczler) were not listed as authors of Gutsch 1988.</P>
<P>On page 186/187, two clinical trials with lung cancer patients are mentioned. According to G. Salzer, the author of the book chapter and initiator of the trials, one of them yielded no &#8216;useful results&#8217; ("<I>Leider lieferte diese Studie keine brauchbaren Ergebnisse (...)</I>"). Due to this statement, it was decided to not include the scarce data of this trial. The second trial was included in the review (Salzer 1991).</P>

<P>This abstract publication was i) not listed in one of the databases which were searched for the review, ii) not mentioned by one of the manufacturers of mistletoe extracts which we had contacted and iii) was not included or even mentioned in one of the systematic reviews published until 2006. Also Kienle &amp; Kiene did not include this trial in their systematic review published in 2003. In Nov, 2008, again, the reference could neither be found in any of the databases listed in the review, nor on a search engine for the &#8216;Korean Journal of Medicine&#8217; (http://www.koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?KM=1&amp;DT=0&amp;DC=20&amp;DisplaySearchResult=1&amp;SS=2) nor on the web site of the &#8216;Korean Association of Internal Medicine&#8217; (http://www.kaim.or.kr).</P>
<P>The cited reference was included in the &#8216;Classification pending references&#8217; section of the review for now.</P>

<P>This paper was checked for eligibility in 2006 but the phrase in the abstract, i.e. "<I>The study involved 70 cancer patients, divided into two groups: Isorel-treated group of 40 patients who received Isorel </I>(...) <I>and the age- and sex-matched control group of 30 patients that did not receive Isorel </I>(...)" and the number of patients in the two study groups raised doubts about the way the groups were constituted. As we had not received any additional information on the allocation procedure from the first author, the study was not included in the review, which was not mentioned by an oversight.</P>
<P>In 2008 we received an authenticated document from the manufacturer of the used mistletoe brand in which the first author of the study certified the randomised allocation to the treatment groups. The study is now included in the &#8216;Studies awaiting classification&#8217; section and will be assessed in the upcoming update of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Cited references [4, 5, 8-11]</B>: These clinical trials are also included in the &#8216;Studies awaiting classification&#8221; section and will be assessed in the upcoming update of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the procedure chosen for evaluation of study quality is inadequate&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>The validity assessment in the review was geared to common practice in systematic reviews. For the purpose of enabling a transparent view on the possible risks of bias in the included studies, key domains of methodological quality were not only assessed by means of widely used criteria lists but also described narratively and annotated with comments. Trials were grouped according to the scores of the criteria lists, and the levels of evidence were judged accordingly. No trial was excluded due to low methodological quality and the results of all outcomes of all included studies were appraised. Moreover, the limitations of checklists of methodological quality were discussed.</P>
<P>Kienle &amp; Kiene themselves used in both of their systematic reviews on mistletoe extracts a "<I>criteria based analysis</I>" to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The criteria were adapted from the approach of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York and from Kleijnen 1994. Both approaches rely on the same key domains used in our review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That two scores were employed which give the greatest weight to blinding of the study intervention&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>The Jadad scale consists of three items relating to the issues randomisation, blinding, and description of withdrawals and drop-outs. Two points are given if randomisation is well-des­cri­bed and the method appropriate, the same is true for blinding and one point is given for the issue of withdrawals and drop-outs. Thus, in the strict sense, the issues of randomisation have unambiguously the same weight than those of blinding.</P>
<P>The maximum score in the Delphi list is nine points. A study could obtain three points for issues related to blinding (patient, care provider, outcome assessor) but also three points could be obtained for issues related to the homogeneity of the study groups (randomisation, allocation concealment, distribution of prognostic indicators between groups). Thus, in this list, issues concerning selection and allocation of the study group have the same weight than those related to blinding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That by selecting the evaluation scales, a poor performance of the mistletoe trials was predetermined as in principle this therapy cannot be blinded&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>This statement is wrong. A well designed and properly conducted open-label study could fulfil a maximum of seven criteria of the Delphi list. Given our arbitrary cut-off point of six out of nine fulfilled Delphi criteria for high methodological quality, blinding of the patient and the care provider is not a prerequisite for receiving this label. Concerning the assessment with the Jadad scale, a well designed and properly conducted study in which the authors at least attempt to double blind the intervention could fulfil a maximum of four criteria of this scale. Given our arbitrary cut-off point of four out of five Jadad criteria for high methodological criteria, a successful blinding of the patient and the care provider is not a prerequisite for receiving this label.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the Cochrane-Review disqualifies all mistletoe trials on this point [blinding], including the trials formally conducted as double-blind trials&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>Again, this statement is wrong. All trials that were classified as of higher methodological quality according to the Jadad scale were designed as double blind (Schwiersch 1999; Semiglasov 2004; Semiglasov 2006).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the problem with blinding of the treatment with mistletoe extracts is not mentioned&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>This is not correct. The problem is addressed in three sections: &#8216;Results&#8217;, &#8216;Discussion&#8217; and &#8216;Implications for research&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the general requirement of blinding has bizarre consequences&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>It was unclear to whom Kienle &amp; Kiene addressed this statement as no one would seriously claim a "<I>general requirement of blinding</I>"in all clinical trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That Piao 2004 was evaluated according to the intention-to-treat-principle&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>Kienle &amp; Kiene cited for Piao 2004 a "<I>biometric trial report available on the Internet</I>" (see Klose et al. [2003] listed in Piao 2004). In this report the following comments concerning the statistical methods of Piao 2004 could be found: Page 12: "<I>In the clinical trial protocol primary and secondary endpoints as well as an analysis strategy are not specified</I>". Page 14: "<I>The analysis has to be interpreted as explorative and has no confirmative power </I>(...)<I> The statistical analysis of the efficacy criteria, safety criteria and quality of life questionnaires follows the as-treated principle (AT analysis).</I>"</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5"> &#8216;That double standards were applied concerning the assessment of Piao 2004 and Steuer-Vogt 2001&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>Piao 2004 was an open-label, 2-arm parallel RCT with an active treatment as control. In the original publication, the aim of the study was described as "<I>to evaluate the impact of a standardized mistletoe extract administered complementary to the standard treatment of patients with breast, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer.</I>" Outcome measures were quality of life, performance status, tumour response, immunological parameters and a safety analysis. It was unclear whether the quality of life outcomes were patient- or physician rated. A primary outcome measure was not defined. Our assessment of this study was based on the original publication and a medical study report.</P>
<P>According to our judgment, the validity and generalizability of the findings of Piao 2004 were primarily limited due to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>possible influences of selection bias (no information on concealment of treatment allocation) and participant/observer bias (unblinded assessment of patient-/physician-rated outcomes),</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>lack of details on whether concomitant supportive medication and sum doses of chemotherapy were comparable between groups,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>variability of length of observation/treatment periods.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was reflected in the respective criteria of the validity assessment.</P>
<P>Steuer-Vogt 2001 was an open-label, 2-arm RCT with two strata in each arm with a no treatment control. The study was reported according to the CONSORT statement. Concerning the aim of the study, the authors stated: "<I>Our study was designed to answer the question of whether an additional treatment of head and neck cancer patients with a ML-1 standardised mistletoe extract leads to an increased DFS compared with patients receiving no additional therapy.</I>" Outcome measures were disease-free survival (primary outcome measure), disease-specific survival, quality of life, immunological parameters and a safety analysis. Our assessment of the study was based on two original publications of the study and two further papers. Concerning withdrawals/drop-outs both trials received one point on the Jadad scale. Concerning intention-to-treat analysis, Piao 2004 received no point on the Delphi list due to the above mentioned reason and Steuer-Vogt 2001 received one point, as the analysis of the primary outcome measure (disease-free survival) followed the intention-to-treat principle. Concerning the quality of life analysis in Steuer-Vogt 2001, we not only judged the results as at risk for the influence of participant bias due to the unblinded investigation but also critically discussed the findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That double standards were applied concerning the assessment of similarity of groups in Kleeberg 2004 and Grossarth-Maticek 2001&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>We judged the Delphi criterion concerning the similarity of groups at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators in both Grossarth-Maticek trials, as &#8216;unclear&#8217; because the matching criteria did not ensure that the matched patients had comparable risks related to survival. For example, given the definition of &#8216;stage III colon carcinoma&#8217; as "<I>N&gt;0 M0</I>" (see p. 61 of the original publication), two patients matched for this stage could mean that one patient had a tumor directly invading other organs with lymph node metastases in four or more regional lymph nodes (T4, N2, M0), whereas the other had a tumor invading the muscularis propria with metastases in one to three regional lymph nodes (T2, N1, M0).</P>
<P>In Kleeberg&#8217;s trial there was indeed a slight imbalance of patient&#8217;s characteristics between the groups. However, the key factors, TNM stage and Breslow thickness, were quite similarly distributed and the higher number of males and patients with non-limb localisation of the primary melanoma in the intervention group could be contrasted with the higher number of patients with ulcerations in the primary tumour in the control group. Considered together, we decided that the groups should be regarded as similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That blinding was not properly assessed in Borrelli 1999 and Dold 1991&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of Borrelli&#8217;s trial was based on two original publications of the study. This trial, which we had found through handsearching, was not included in any of the systematic reviews published until 2006 (including that of Kienle &amp; Kiene) and the manufacturers of the mistletoe brand used in Borrelli&#8217;s trial did not even provide information on the existence of this trial.</P>
<P>There is no statement concerning blinding of the interventions in either of the publications.</P>
<P>As the author reported the use of a placebo in the control group (see p. 28 in the original publication), we at least assumed a single blinded design. Nevertheless, due to the lack of information we judged the respective criteria of the validity assessment as &#8216;unclear&#8217;.</P>
<P>For the upcoming update of the review, the author will be contacted and the study will be reappraised provided that reliable information will be made available concerning blinding of the intervention and concealment of allocation.</P>
<P>Kienle &amp; Kiene claimed that "<I>the Cochrane-Review allocates the Dold trial a plus point in the Delphi list regarding adequate blinding of patients</I>". This statement is wrong. Dold 1991 reported a central, independent and anonymous outcome assessment and therefore the criteria of the Delphi list concerning a concealed outcome assessment was judged as being fulfilled.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That concealment of allocation was not properly assessed in Borrelli 1999 and Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s trials</HEADING>
<P>Concerning the assessment of concealment of allocation in Borrelli 1999 see the precedent comment.</P>
<P>In Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s trials drawing of lots was used to assign participants to the intervention (see p. 4 in the original publication). This procedure is transparent before allocation, and, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Reviewer&#8217;s Handbook, this method does not ensure concealed allocation. Therefore, we assessed the criterion of the Delphi list related to concealment of allocation as &#8216;unclear&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That it was improper to claim that in the Grossarth trials it was unclear whether the patients had consented to participate&#8217;.</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of the trials of Grossarth-Maticek et al. in our review was based on two original publications, and in none of these publications a statement could be found that patients of the nested RCTs had given their informed consent for participation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That Grossarth achieves what almost all experimental trials are incapable of: to maximise internal and external validity within a single research project&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>The two included studies of Grossarth-Maticek et al. had the following design:</P>
<UL>
<LI>participants of a large cohort study were matched,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>a small number of the matched pairs formed the basis for a nested RCT,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>in this RCT, one of the matched participants was randomly allocated to the intervention,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>the intervention was the advise "<I>to ask their doctor for treatment with Iscador</I>" (see p. 60 in in the original publication),</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>during follow-up, participants were "<I>questioned about well-being, progression of disease, further diseases, continuation of treatment, and new therapies.</I>" (see p. 62, l.c.).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>concerning the intervention, "<I>only the basic fact of an Iscador treatment and its global duration were documented. The type of Iscador that was used (&#8230;) the dosage, and temporary interruptions of treatment were not documented.</I>" (see p. 62, l.c.).</LI>
</UL>
<P>No information was given (if collected at all) concerning any tumour-related or other treatments. The conclusion of the authors of the trials was: &#8220;<I>Iscador treatment can achieve a clinically relevant prolongation of survival time of cancer patients.&#8221; </I>If this causal inference indeed possessed the alleged high degree of external validity then the life of many cancer patients could be prolonged by the simple advice &#8220;<I>to ask their doctor for treatment with Iscador</I>&#8221; irrespective of what other treatments would be applied. Such a reasoning appears not only overconfident but somewhat cynical regarding the daily efforts of all parties concerned with oncological treatment and care.</P>
<P>With their claim of a &#8216;maximised internal and external validity&#8217; the authors overlook not only that basic criteria of internal validity are not fulfilled in Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s trials, but also that the generalizability is severely limited because important factors (i.e. tumour-related therapies) interacting with the independent variable (i.e. survival) are not assessed. Furthermore, the critical discussion of the underlying cohort studies (see: Issue 3 of Psychological Inquiry [Vol. 2, 1991]) is not mentioned by Kienle &amp; Kiene.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the use of active control therapy in Piao 2004 was not acknowledged as a reasonable alternative and the therapy benefit of mistletoe extracts was deemed unsuitable for assessment since the effects of the control therapy (Lentinan)&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>In Piao 2004, the groups were compared concerning the changes of the scores of the quality of life questionnaires. The authors found a significant higher improvement in the mistletoe group compared with the group in which lentinan, a biologic response modifier, had been given. However, the direction of the effect of lentinan on issues of quality of life is unclear, at least in this study. Therefore, we concluded that the differences in the quality of life scores between the groups could be attributed either to positive effects of mistletoe extracts or to negative effects of lentinan. To reliably clarify this issue a placebo or no-treatment group would have been necessary.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the status &#8220;unpublished&#8221; was an exclusion criterion for the Kienle Review from 2003 and as a consequence, Schwiersch 1999 and Lange 1993 were not included&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>In this review the authors stated "<I>Publication as a manuscript or abstract (e.g. conference report)</I>" as inclusion criteria. This was misinterpreted by us, as Schwiersch 1999 and Lange 1993 were both available, though unpublished, as submission manuscripts. The respective section in the review was changed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the trials mentioned in Salzer 1987 were not properly handled&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>Please see the first specific comment of this reply concerning the trials mentioned in Salzer 1987. The respective section in the review was changed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">&#8216;That the decision to conduct this review was described as resulting from discrepancies between earlier reviews (e.g. Kienle 2003, Ernst 2003, Lange-Lindberg 2006) whereas the protocol for this review was already available in the Cochrane Library long before these reviews were accessible.&#8217;</HEADING>
<P>The protocol of the review was first published in the Cochrane Library in 2001. The passage in the background section of the protocol to which the statement of Kienle &amp; Kiene alludes was: "<I>Despite this widespread use of mistletoe preparations, there is considerable dispute about the efficacy of this treatment modality and the results of the existing reviews concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of this treatment are inconsistent (Kiene 1991, Hauser 1993, Kleijnen 1994).</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>For several reasons it seems necessary to systematically review the available evidence of mistletoe treatment of cancer:</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>The results of the present reviews are inconsistent.</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>Several new clinical trials with mistletoe preparations have been published recently.</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>The therapeutic paradigm of this treatment modality and thus the endpoints of the clinical studies have shifted during the last years from tumor response towards quality of life and alleviation of side effects of chemo- and radiotherapy. </I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>A new treatment approach emerged over the last years, which contrasts with the classical treatment modality. Both concepts are subject of substantial debate. The latter works with mistletoe preparations standardized for the manufacturing process and are applied at individual doses whereas the new approach applies preparations standardized for the b-galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin I in a constant dosage schedule.</I>"</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the review, we adjusted the passage to the topical discussion, which still is characterised in that "<I>The existing reviews used different approaches to collect and appraise the evidence and varied in their interpretations of the data</I>" (see last passage of the review).</P>
