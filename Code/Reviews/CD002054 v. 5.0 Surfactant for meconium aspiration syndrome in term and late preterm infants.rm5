<BR/>Since this review was first published, two additional trials were identified.<BR/>
<BR/>The increase in sample size has allowed for greater precision for some of the treatment effects. Surfactant treatment does not appear to have an effect on mortality, but does reduce the need for treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Surfactant treatment may reduce respiratory related outcomes and hospital stay in term/near-term infants with meconium aspiration syndrome.</P>

<P>Lay title: Surfactant treatment for infants who have inhaled meconium into the lungs in or around the time of birth</P>
<P>Review question: Does the administration of surfactant improve lung function and lead to better clinical outcomes in infants born at or near term who have inhaled meconium in or around the time of birth?</P>
<P>Background: The lungs of newborn babies can be damaged by meconium aspiration syndrome. Meconium aspiration syndrome is caused when a stressed baby passes a bowel movement while still in the womb and then breathes some of this material into the lungs. Pulmonary surfactant, the complex combination of chemicals that line the surface of the lung, may be altered or inactivated in babies who have meconium aspiration. It is thought that treatment with additional surfactant might help overcome this damage. </P>
<P>Study characteristics: Four randomised controlled trials enrolling 326 infants met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Results: This review of trials found that surfactant can prevent worsening of breathing difficulties and reduce the need for heart-lung bypass therapy in some babies suffering from meconium aspiration syndrome .</P>

<P>We extracted data on clinical outcomes including mortality, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), pneumothorax, duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade and severe IVH), and chronic lung disease.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-01 15:20:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of four trials (326 infants) showed no statistically significant effect on mortality [typical risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 2.39; typical risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05]. There was no heterogeneity for this outcome (I = 0% for both RR and RD). The risk of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was significantly reduced in a meta-analysis of two trials (n = 208); [typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91; typical RD -0.17, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.04; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 3 to 25]. There was no heterogeneity for RR (1 = 0%) but moderate heterogeneity for RD (I = 50%). One trial (n = 40) reported a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (mean difference -8 days, 95% CI -14 to -3 days; test for heterogeneity not applicable). There were no statistically significant reductions in any other outcomes studied (duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, air leaks, chronic lung disease, need for oxygen at discharge or intraventricular haemorrhage).<BR/>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In infants with MAS, surfactant administration may reduce the severity of respiratory illness and decrease the number of infants with progressive respiratory failure requiring support with ECMO. The relative efficacy of surfactant therapy compared to, or in conjunction with, other approaches to treatment including inhaled nitric oxide, liquid ventilation, surfactant lavage and high frequency ventilation remains to be tested.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-14 06:45:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The deficiency of surfactant or surfactant dysfunction may contribute to respiratory failure in a broad group of disorders, including meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium inhibits the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moses-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 1991</LINK>). Instillation of meconium into the airways of term animals leads to acute mechanical obstruction and worsening pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyler-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyler 1978</LINK>). A significant reduction in lung compliance, an increase in expiratory lung resistance and increased functional residual capacity can be demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Tran-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 1980</LINK>). Investigators have postulated that the changes in compliance associated with meconium aspiration result from displacement of surfactant by free fatty acids (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1987</LINK>). In animals with experimentally induced meconium aspiration, treatment with large doses of animal-derived surfactant extract improves compliance and ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-01 15:56:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surfactant replacement therapy has been proven beneficial in the prevention and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). Respiratory distress syndrome is due to a primary deficiency in the production and release of pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant therapy has been shown to improve oxygenation, decrease the need for ventilatory support, and improve clinical outcome in infants with RDS. Surfactant-treated infants have a reduced mortality and a decreased incidence of pneumothorax.</P>
<P>Uncontrolled studies of surfactant treatment in infants with MAS suggest that surfactant may be of benefit in MAS. In a pilot study of seven infants with MAS treated with surfactant, all seven demonstrated an improvement in respiratory failure (<LINK REF="STD-Auten-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Auten 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Khammash-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khammash 1993</LINK> treated 20 infants with severe MAS. Infants received an intratracheal dose of bovine surfactant extract (100 mg phospholipid/kg). Improvement in oxygenation index (OI) and arterial/alveolar ratio (a/A pO&#8322;) were noted in 75% of the treated infants in the six hours following surfactant instillation. None of the treated infants required further experimental therapy, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</P>
<P>Other approaches to prevent or treat MAS include amnioinfusion (infusion of saline into the amniotic cavity), oronasopharyngeal suctioning of meconium-stained neonates before delivery and the use of surfactant lavage in infants with the diagnosis of MAS.</P>
<P>In a systematic review of amnioinfusion in women with meconium-stained fluid, <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK> found no significant reduction in the primary outcomes of MAS, perinatal death or severe morbidity, and maternal death or severe morbidity. However, some benefits were reported in a subgroup analysis including studies performed at facilities where perinatal surveillance was limited. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Vain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vain 2004</LINK> assessed the effectiveness of intrapartum suctioning for the prevention of MAS in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome was the incidence of MAS. No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the incidence of MAS, in mortality, or in the duration of ventilation, oxygen treatment, and hospital care. The authors concluded that routine intrapartum oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning of term-gestation infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid does not prevent MAS. These findings led to changes in clinical practice, with routine suctioning of the oropharynx and the nasopharynx currently not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>For each included study, we collected information regarding the method of randomisation, blinding, drug intervention, stratification, and whether the trial was single- or multicentre. We noted information regarding trial participants, including gestational age criteria, birth weight criteria, cause of respiratory failure, severity of respiratory failure, and postnatal age at the time of treatment. We extracted information on clinical outcomes, including mortality, treatment with ECMO, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, chronic lung disease, duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, need for supplemental oxygen at discharge, duration of hospital stay, and intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade and grades III and IV). We contacted investigators or study sponsors for clarification or provision of data not specifically noted in the original report. For the update in 2007, two review authors (AS, AO) independently evaluated all studies, abstracted the data onto extraction forms and compared and agreed the abstracted data. One review author (AS) entered the data into RevMan 4.2.9 and the other review author (AO) checked the data for accuracy. Unpublished information on the subgroup of infants with MAS obtained from Lotze at al (<LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>) included in the original review were entered unchanged.

<P>We have used the standard review methods of the CNRG (<A HREF="http://www.neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html">About the CNRG</A>) to assess the methodological quality of included studies.</P>
<P>For the 2014 update of the review, two review authors (AO, AS) assessed the following areas and completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection bias</B> (random sequence generation and allocation concealment).</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the risk of selection bias as:</P>
<P>
<I>Random sequence generation: </I>
</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); High risk - inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment:</I>
</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); High risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Performance bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study personnel to knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention).</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group); High risk - inadequate - personnel aware of group assignment; Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Detection bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessors to knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods used with regards to detection bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate; follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group; High risk - inadequate; assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment; Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods with respect to the risk of attrition bias as: Low risk - adequate (fewer than 10% missing data); High risk - inadequate (more than 10% missing data); Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (e.g. the study protocol was not available).</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised; High risk - concerns raised about multiple checking of the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of participants enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper; Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the study authors.</P>
<P>Where necessary, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK> is a single-centre study performed in the USA:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To determine whether high-dose surfactant therapy improves the pulmonary morbidity of term infants ventilated for meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).</LI>
<LI>Population: Term newborn infants with MAS, diagnosed by the presence of meconium below the vocal cords at birth with or without characteristic chest radiographic findings, who needed ventilator support before six hours of age with a fractional inspired oxygen (Fi0&#8322;) level of 0.5 or more, mean airway pressure of 7 cm of H&#8322;O or more and arterial/alveolar (a/A) pO&#8322; ratio of 0.22 or less.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: Infants in the study group received up to four doses of 150 mg (6ml)/kg beractant (Survanta), installed every six hours by continuous infusion for 20 minutes via a side hole endotracheal tube adapter. Infants in the control group received 6 ml/kg air placebo.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: Primary outcomes included decrease in Oxygen Index (OI), increase in a/A pO&#8322; ratio and decrease in the need for respiratory support (mean airway pressure (MAP), ventilation days). Secondary outcomes included the need for ECMO, incidence of air leaks, duration of oxygen therapy, discharge with supplemental oxygen, and mortality at less than 28 days of life.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK> is a multicentre study performed in the USA:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To determine whether surfactant (beractant) administration to term newborns in respiratory failure and at risk of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment would significantly reduce the incidence of severe complications through 28 days of age and the need for ECMO.</LI>
<LI>Population: Infants weighing 2000 gm or more with gestational ages of 36 weeks or greater with respiratory failure secondary to MAS, sepsis or idiopathic persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (requiring FiO&#8322; 1.00 with OI of 15 to 39).</LI>
<LI>Intervention: Infants were randomly assigned to receive either four doses of beractant 100 mg/kg or air placebo before ECMO treatment and four additional doses during ECMO, if ECMO was required (only infants with MAS are included in this analysis and the data were provided by the authors).</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: Need for ECMO and incidence of severe complications (haemorraghic, neurologic, pulmonary, renal, cardiovascular, infectious, metabolic and technical) during the first 28 days of age or at discharge.</LI>

<P>The Chinese Collaborative Study (<LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>) is a multicentre study performed in China:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of exogenous surfactant replacement therapy for MAS in term and late preterm neonates.</LI>
<LI>Population: Term and late preterm neonates with MAS (diagnosis based on the presence of meconium in the airways with or without meconium-stained amniotic fluid at delivery, typical chest x-ray findings, onset of respiratory distress, and abnormal blood gas findings indicating respiratory failure and acidosis), birth weight greater than 2500 gm, postnatal age less than 36 hours, a/A pO&#8322; ratio less than 0.22, OI greater than 15 and need for mechanical ventilation for one to two hours without improvement.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: The infants in the surfactant group received an initial dose of porcine lung-derived surfactant (Curosurf) at 200 mg/kg, with repeated doses of 200, 100 and 100 mg/kg given at 6 to 12 hourly intervals to a maximum of four doses if OI increased by more than two from baseline. The control group received the standard care without a placebo.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: The primary outcomes were a reduction of OI to less than 10 and an increase of the pretreatment a/A pO&#8322; ratio of 100% over baseline 24 hours after surfactant treatment. The secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of complications and survival to discharge from hospital.</LI>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK> is a multicentre study performed in Chile:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To evaluate the use of up to three doses of surfactant administered as a bolus (150 mg/kg) versus placebo to reduce the number of days on mechanical ventilation in term infants with moderate to severe MAS.</LI>
<LI>Population: Term newborns more than 37 weeks of gestation with moderate to severe MAS (defined as the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid with or without evidence of meconium in the lower airway, abnormal x-ray consistent with MAS and respiratory insufficiency defined as an oxygen requirement of 50% or more in an oxyhood to achieve saturation of greater than 90% or PaO&#8322; more than 50 mmHg if the infant was not ventilated, or an OI more than eight if the infant was on mechanical ventilation.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: Infants were randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg /kg/dose (6ml) of Survanta or an equivalent amount of air as placebo every six hours for total of three doses if they remained intubated.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: The primary outcome was days on mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included days requiring oxygen therapy with a target arterial oxygen saturation of more than 90%, air leaks (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, interstitial emphysema), persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN), OI after two hours following the first treatment dose, and mortality before discharge.</LI>
<LI>Notes: We obtained from the first author an unpublished manuscript of the study that included an additional four randomised infants (three infants in the surfactant group and one in the control group) compared to the published abstract. In the analyses we report on 28 infants in the surfactant group and 29 in the air-placebo group as per the additional information we received from the authors.</LI>

<P>Randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effect of bolus surfactant administration in term or late preterm infants with MAS are included in the analysis. We discuss specific methodologic issues below:</P>
<P>Randomisation: The four included studies allocated treatments by randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK> the randomisation scheme was computer-generated. The Collaborative Chinese Study (<LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK> used sealed randomisation envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK> did not report on the method of randomisation, but stated that physicians and nurses caring for the infants were unaware of the infants' assignment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK> used a central randomisation service and stratified infants by primary diagnosis and disease severity.</P>
<P>Blinding of treatment: In <LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK> the attending staff were unaware of treatment assignment. In <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>, the dosing investigator was prohibited from participating in any other aspects of infants' care and from revealing the treatment assignment. In the Chinese Collaborative Study (<LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>), staff were not blinded to treatment groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>, the assigned treatment was administered by a person not involved in the direct infant care and was given behind a screen. The number of infants enrolled in the trial differed between the published abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>) and the information obtained from the first author (three additional infants in the surfactant group and one additional infant in the control group). Differences noted between abstracts and full reports may indicate elements of bias/poor data quality control, possibly including any of the following methodological issues: multiple examination of the data; changes in the definitions of outcomes; no prespecified sample size; closure of participant recruitment when statistical significance has been reached for the outcome under study, and other sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Walia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walia 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment: Outcomes were assessed by staff members unaware of treatment assignment in three of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exclusion after randomisation: In <LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>, 66 infants were enrolled and five infants (four in the surfactant group and one in the control group) were excluded from the final analysis because of violation of the entry criteria. In <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK> all 330 randomised infants were accounted for (168 of these infants were enrolled on the basis of MAS, and the remaining infants on the basis of PPHN or sepsis). Two infants were later withdrawn from the study when parental consent was withdrawn. Their limited data were subsequently excluded from analysis. The diagnosis on which their enrolment was based and whether or not they had MAS was not reported.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-12-01 17:35:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deficiency or dysfunction, or both, of pulmonary surfactant may contribute to respiratory failure in a broad group of disorders including pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), and adult respiratory distress syndrome. We identified four randomised controlled trials that studied the effect of surfactant therapy in term and late preterm infants with MAS. Three of the studies were placebo-controlled using air as the placebo, and in these three studies the outcomes were assessed blinded to group of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>). In the fourth study, the clinical staff were not blinded to group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>). The sample sizes of the studies were small with 40, 57, 61, and 168 infants enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>) respectively. The number of infants enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK> differed between the published abstract and the information obtained from the author. There were four more infants included in the report that we obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>Surfactant treatment did not have a statistically significant effect on the primary outcome of mortality. In the meta-analysis of the results from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lotze-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lotze 1998</LINK>), surfactant treatment resulted in a statistically and clinically important reduction in the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 3 to 25). ECMO treatment was not available for the units in the Chinese Collaborative study (<LINK REF="STD-Chinese-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chinese Study Group 2005</LINK>), nor in the study from Chile (<LINK REF="STD-Maturana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maturana 2005</LINK>). The one study (<LINK REF="STD-Findlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Findlay 1996</LINK>) that reported on duration of hospital stay demonstrated a reduction in hospital days. There were no other statistically significant reductions in any of the other important clinical outcomes (duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, air leaks, chronic lung disease, duration of assisted ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen at discharge and intraventricular haemorrhage). The trends for all respiratory tract-associated outcomes favoured the use of surfactant.</P>
<P>A number of investigators have attempted to treat MAS with dilute surfactant solutions used as a lavage to wash residual meconium from the airway (<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibara-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ibara 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK> enrolled 22 infants [15 surfactant (Surfaxin) and 7 control]. There were non-significant trends for surfactant-lavaged infants to be weaned from mechanical ventilation earlier (mean of 6.3 vs. 9.9 days, respectively), as well as to have a more rapid decline in their oxygenation index (OI) compared with control infants. Since the last update of this review, <LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK> has published a randomised controlled trial of lavage with two dilute bovine surfactants in the treatment of MAS. Sixty-six infants were randomised, with one ineligible infant excluded from the analysis. In this study, fewer infants who underwent lavage died or required ECMO (10% compared with 31% in the control group). However, surfactant lavage did not alter the duration of respiratory support (median duration in the lavage group 5.5. days and in the control group 6.0 days). Randomised comparisons are warranted of surfactant bolus versus surfactant lavage therapy in MAS.</P>
<P>Current evidence indicates that amnioinfusion prior to birth or suctioning of the oropharynx/nasopharynx prior to the delivery of the shoulders do not prevent MAS from occurring. At the present time, the two most promising interventions appear to be treatment with surfactant or surfactant lavage. As few infants have been studied to date, further research is warranted, possibly using a three-armed trial with 1) surfactant administration, 2) surfactant lavage and 3) a control group receiving air.</P>
<P>Clinical experience indicates that persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is one of the major causes of death in infants with MAS (<LINK REF="REF-Hsieh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsieh 2004</LINK>). There is evidence that meconium injury may directly trigger postnatal release of vasoconstrictors such as ET-1, TXA2, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Soukka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soukka 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infants with MAS and PPHN are usually treated with oxygen, conventional or high frequency mechanical ventilation or both, inotropic support, induction of alkalosis, and sedation. When these measures fail, ECMO has been shown to improve the outcome (<LINK REF="REF-UK-Collab-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Collab 1996</LINK>). Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is frequently used for the treatment of newborns with severe pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure. Consequently, increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggest that exogenous NO, given by inhalation, selectively reduces pulmonary vasoconstriction and improves oxygenation in a variety of pathological conditions of the newborn lungs, including meconium aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Neonatal-iNO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neonatal iNO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Meurs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Meurs 2003</LINK>). In recent experimental data, <LINK REF="REF-Aaltonen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaltonen 2007</LINK> demonstrated that iNO in MAS is associated with diminished pulmonary hypertensive response as well as decreased DNA oxidation and neuronal damage in hippocampal tissue that may potentially have significant adverse long-term effects on the developmental status of the affected newborns.</P>
<P>ECMO procedures are complex because they require systemic anticoagulation and major vessel cannulation. Studies of iNO therapy for PPHN have shown rapid improvement in oxygenation, reducing the need for ECMO therapy without affecting the mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Christou-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christou 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Finer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2000</LINK> showed that iNO treatment improves oxygenation in approximately 50% of term or late preterm neonates with hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and reduces the combined end point of death or the need for ECMO therapy (risk ratio 0.73) as compared with control subjects. However, lack of an early response to iNO treatment within a few hours in infants who are referred for ECMO therapy and younger age at the time of presentation may indicate the need for ECMO therapy in at least 50% of those with hypoxic respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Fakioglu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakioglu 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-10-14 12:07:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The results of this systematic review provide some support for the use of surfactant treatment in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). In infants with MAS leading to moderate to severe respiratory failure, surfactant administration will decrease the number of infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This may have implications especially in resource-poor settings where ECMO is not available. In the only study reporting on the duration of hospital stay, this outcomes was significantly reduced.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-14 12:07:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Although surfactant therapy may be of use in severe MAS, the efficacy of surfactant therapy compared to other approaches including inhaled nitric oxide, liquid ventilation, and high frequency ventilation remains to be tested. Other approaches to surfactant therapy, including the use of surfactant lavage, may prove to be effective in the treatment of MAS. Trials that compare surfactant treatment to surfactant lavage and air (control) would be appropriate. The findings of this review need to be confirmed in randomised controlled trials of appropriate size.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003</LINK> retrospectively reviewed the charts of all term infants with a diagnosis of MAS who had an oxygenation index (OI) &gt; 20 during a 2-year period.

<P>The records of 22 patients were reviewed, of whom 12 had undergone lavage. These infants were subdivided into low-concentration (surfactant concentration, 5 mg/mL; n = 6) and high-concentration (surfactant concentration, 10 mg/mL; n = 6) subgroups. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the 2 subgroups. The lavaged infants had a significantly higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO&#8322;) 24 hours after lavage than the infants without lavage (178.3 mm Hg vs 80.6 mm Hg, P &lt; 0.05). The incidence of pneumothorax (1/12 vs 7/10, P &lt; 0.05) and requirement for inhaled nitric oxide (5/12 vs 9/10, P &lt; 0.05) were significantly lower in the lavaged group. All infants tolerated the procedure well except for 2 with transient complications. There were no significant differences in duration of lavage, response and complications between subgroups lavaged at low and high surfactant concentration.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK> evaluated whether lung lavage with surfactant changes the duration of mechanical respiratory support or other outcomes in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Randomised controlled trial that enrolled ventilated infants with MAS. Infants randomised to lavage received two 15-mL/kg aliquots of dilute bovine surfactant instilled into, and recovered from, the lung. Control subjects received standard care, which in both groups included high frequency ventilation, nitric oxide, and, where available, ECMO.</P>
<P></P>
<P>66 infants were randomised, with 1 ineligible infant excluded from analysis. Median duration of respiratory support was similar in infants who underwent lavage and control subjects (5.5 vs. 6.0 days, P = .77). Requirement for high frequency ventilation and nitric oxide did not differ between the groups. Fewer infants who underwent lavage died or required ECMO: 10% (3/30) compared with 31% (11/35) in the control group (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.060 to 0.97).

<LINK REF="STD-Gadzinowski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gadzinowski 2008</LINK> compared the effectiveness of surfactant treatment either by bolus or surfactant lung lavage followed by inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy in infants with MAS complicated by persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN).</P>
<P>13 infants with diagnosis of MAS and PPHN were first treated with conventional respiratory support. Then between 2 and 22 hrs of life they were randomised either to bolus surfactant treatment (n = 6) or surfactant lung lavage (SLL, n = 7) treatment. Then all infants were treated with iNO therapy. The groups were compared with regard to their clinical course: changes in PaO&#8322;, FiO&#8322;, MAP, OI, A-a oxygen gradient, duration of iNO therapy, length of ventilation and hospitalisation. Complications and mortality were also compared.</P>
<P>The results showed that infants treated with SLL had significant improvements in oxygenation, decreases in MAP and A-a gradients. But there were no significant differences in duration of ventilation, iNO treatment, length of hospitalisation or complications. In conclusion these data show no advantage of SLL therapy over bolus surfactant treatment in infants with MAS complicated by PPHN.</P>

<P>Radiological improvement was evident in all 8 infants 6 hours post-treatment.
