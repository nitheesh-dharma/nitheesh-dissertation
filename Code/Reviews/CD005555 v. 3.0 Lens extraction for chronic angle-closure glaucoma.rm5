<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Removal of the lens as a treatment for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma results in debilitating loss of vision. Lens extraction or removal of the lens in this condition is thought to improve drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. This review evaluated available evidence of effectiveness of lens extraction as a treatment for people with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma. No randomized trials were found. Subsequently, as stated in the protocol for this review, two non-randomized trials were included. Both studies were of poor methodological quality. There is no published evidence of effectiveness of lens extraction as a treatment option for chronic primary angle-closure.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by obstruction to the outflow of aqueous humor and consequent rise in intraocular pressure. The obstruction may result from an anatomical predisposition of the eye or may be due to pathophysiologic processes in any part of the eye. The former is considered the primary form and the latter a secondary form of angle closure. Relative pupillary block obstructing free flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber of the eye to the anterior chamber is considered to be the most common mechanism of angle closure. Crowding of the angle is another mechanism, which often coexists with pupillary block. This can result from an anterior placement of the lens due to an increase in the thickness of the lens (as occurs with aging), anterior displacement by a posterior force (for example choroidal effusion), or laxity of the zonules.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of lens extraction for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma compared with other interventions for the condition in people without past history of acute-angle closure attacks.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL (2005, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2006), EMBASE (1980 to April 2006), and LILACS (to August 2005). We searched the reference lists of included studies and used the Science Citation Index database.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>In the absence of any randomized trials we included non-randomized studies comparing lens extraction with other treatment modalities for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma including, but not limited to, laser iridotomy, medications, and laser iridoplasty. We excluded studies with a case-series design.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data on methodological quality of the included studies, outcomes for the review, and study characteristics including participant characteristics, interventions, and sources of funding. Differences were resolved through discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found no randomized trials evaluating the effects of lens extraction as a treatment for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma. Two non-randomized comparative studies included in the review have several methodological flaws including selection bias. While these studies and other non-comparative studies provide information on biological plausibility and treatment effect they do not provide proof of effectiveness. Also, they do not address the question of how primary lens extraction compares with other treatments for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from good quality randomized trials or non-randomized studies of the effectiveness of lens extraction for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Aqueous humor is secreted in the posterior chamber of the eye, passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber and is drained through the trabecular meshwork. Angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) is characterized by obstruction to the outflow of aqueous humor and consequent rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). The obstruction may result from an anatomical predisposition of the eye or due to pathophysiologic processes in any part of the eye. The former is considered the primary form and the latter a secondary form of angle closure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology and pathogenesis</HEADING>
<P>Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) has variable prevalence in different parts of the world. Higher prevalence rates were reported in Eskimos of Canada and Greenland compared to white populations in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Bankes-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bankes 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clemmesen-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemmesen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drance-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drance 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollows-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollows 1966</LINK>). Recent studies in Asian countries including China, India, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan as well as studies in South Africa and Mongolia, reported higher prevalence and incidence rates of PACG compared to those reported in studies of white populations (<LINK REF="REF-Chew-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chew 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okabe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okabe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salmon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salmon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-See-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">See 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 1990</LINK>). The reasons for these differences in prevalence across racial groups are not clearly understood.</P>
<P>Relative pupillary block obstructing free flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber of the eye to the anterior chamber is considered to be the most common mechanism of angle closure, although some have postulated that other mechanisms (such as plateau iris configuration, choroidal expansion, and others) play a substantial role (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tornquist-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tornquist 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wand-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wand 1977</LINK>). Relative pupillary block can be a consequence of a more anteriorly-placed lens coupled with a steeper anterior surface resulting in an increased area of contact between the lens and iris (<LINK REF="REF-Mapstone-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mapstone 1968</LINK>). The raised pressure in the posterior chamber causes the iris to bow forwards, which occludes the angle of the eye and aqueous drainage through apposition. Synechiae or adhesions may develop in the long term, which can result in further damage to the trabecular meshwork and lead to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).</P>
<P>Crowding of the angle is another mechanism of angle closure, which often coexists with pupillary block and can also cause ACG by itself. This results from an anterior placement of the lens due to either an increase in thickness or anterior displacement of the lens, anterior rotation of the ciliary body, or perhaps iris anatomical factors such as thickening of the peripheral iris.</P>
<P>Secondary ACG is an angle closure secondary to some pathologic process in the eye such as posterior synechiae, neovascularization, etc. Treatment for secondary angle-closure is usually focused on managing the underlying pathology.</P>
<P>In a retrospective chart review of patients younger than 40 years, angle closure was found to be more frequently associated with structural or developmental abnormalities than with relative pupillary block (<LINK REF="REF-Ritch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritch 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Chronic PACG presents either asymptomatically or with symptoms that are a consequence of long-standing damage to the optic nerve due to raised IOP. Signs of chronic PACG include a narrow or closed angle along with disc cupping or nerve fiber layer defects, elevated IOP and visual field defects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Many treatments have been suggested for the management of both acute and chronic forms of PACG. These include laser iridotomy, medications, laser iridoplasty, and surgical procedures. The effectiveness of medical interventions is being addressed in a Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2006</LINK> and a Cochrane review on iridectomy is also underway. While traditional trabeculectomy is often used in ACG, others have proposed trabeculotomy/ gonioplasty as an alternative surgical approach. Finally, since the lens is clearly involved in the development of PACG, researchers have suggested that lens extraction alone may be adequate to treat some cases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review </HEADING>
<P>Pupillary block and angle crowding, important mechanisms for the development of PACG, can be effectively managed by extraction of the lens. However, the effectiveness of lens extraction compared to other interventions for both chronic and acute PACG is unknown. This review proposes to examine systematically the evidence regarding the effectiveness of lens extraction as a treatment for chronic PACG.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We planned to include randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials in this review.</P>
<P>As per our protocol, failing to find any relevant randomized controlled trials we included prospective and retrospective non-randomized, comparative studies in an attempt to summarize the existing information on lens extraction for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). We excluded studies with a case-series design. There was no restriction based on language, date of publication or number of participants.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies enrolling participants diagnosed with chronic PACG, to have been defined as gonioscopic evidence of angle closure in association with either glaucomatous optic neuropathy with or without visual field defects or elevated intraocular pressure ((IOP). For the purpose of this review we did not include persons with known symptomatic attacks in the past. Such persons may develop chronic disease but symptomatic patients may be substantially different from those with asymptomatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang 2004</LINK>). Where studies presented data on participants with chronic ACG with known symptomatic attacks in the past and those without, we attempted to procure data on the latter group. There were no restrictions with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, co-morbidities, use of adjunctive medications or the number of participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the included studies for the following sources of systematic bias using forms that were developed for this purpose. The forms were developed based on criteria for validity of non-randomized studies discussed by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK> and using an adaptation of the form developed by <LINK REF="REF-Zaza-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaza 2000</LINK>. Randomized trials were to be assessed for methodological quality according to the guidelines in Section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed the included studies for different biases in the following manner.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Selection bias<BR/>
</I>
</B>Were the participants selected to different treatment groups in an unbiased fashion?<BR/>If the study had not adopted some method of random or quasi-random allocation of participants we examined the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Were the criteria for allocation of participants to the treatment groups specified explicitly?</LI>
<LI>Does the selection method adopted minimize the chance that participants with favorable outcomes were preferentially selected?</LI>
<LI>Were the two groups comparable at baseline with respect to important prognostic factors?</LI>
<LI>Were appropriate statistical methods used to adjust for the confounding factors?</LI>
<LI>Were the factors adjusted for specified a priori?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Measurement of confounding factors in the participants was assessed for consistency.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Performance bias<BR/>
</I>
</B>We examined whether the intervention has been clearly defined as per a pre-specified protocol for prospective studies and whether the intervention was determined in an objective fashion (medical records etc.) rather than self-reporting in prospective and retrospective studies. Further, we assessed whether the interventions were administered consistently to all participants.</P>
<P>Masking of participants and caregivers is not possible for the intervention under consideration and was not assessed, although masked measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) and other outcomes was considered.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Attrition bias<BR/>
</I>
</B>The follow-up times and losses to follow up in each group were examined. We also evaluated any reasons for losses to follow up that were described to assess whether any differential losses were likely to have influenced the conclusion of the particular study.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Detection bias<BR/>
</I>
</B>For prospective study designs we examined masking of outcome assessors, standardization, pre-specification of methods used to assess the outcome and adherence to prespecified measurement protocol for the outcomes.</P>
<P>For retrospective studies we assessed whether explicit criteria stated a priori for identifying a clinical condition were used for inclusion of participants in the study. We also attempted to assess adherence to such criteria.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data on primary and secondary outcomes onto paper data collection forms developed by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We planned to contact study authors for missing data. One author entered all data into RevMan 4.2 and verified it using the double-data entry facility.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We did not conduct any data synthesis for this review.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>For randomized studies, we will assess the method of randomization and allocation concealment. Allocation concealment will be graded as A (adequate), B (inadequate) or C (unclear). We will contact the primary investigators of trials classified as C (unclear) for clarification. We will also assess the trials for exclusions after randomization and reasons for any.</P>
<P>We will evaluate losses to follow-up and reasons for losses to follow-up. Randomized studies will also be assessed for analysis on an intention-to-treat basis (whether participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized). We will examine whether randomized participants for whom no outcome data were collected, and those who received only some or none of their allotted treatment, were included in the analysis. We will consider it to be an intention-to-treat analysis if all three criteria mentioned above are met. We will evaluate masking of outcome assessment to assess for detection bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Data analysis will follow the guidelines set out in Section 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). We will calculate a summary risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. The mean difference will be calculated for continuous outcomes. Standardized mean difference will be reported if outcomes are measured using different scales. We will attempt to quantify the proportion of variability within included randomized studies that is explained by heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). If the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic is greater than 50% we will consider it as substantial heterogeneity and will not combine the study results in a meta-analysis. Instead we will present the studies in a tabulated or narrative summary. We will examine funnel plot symmetry for evidence of other sources of heterogeneity. If there is no substantial heterogeneity as per the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic we will combine the results of the included studies in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. We will use a fixed-effect model if there are fewer than three studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of excluding randomized studies with lower methodological quality, excluding quasi-randomized studies, varying cut-off points for inclusion criteria and excluding unpublished studies and industry-funded studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>If the variability in effect estimates of the included studies explained by heterogeneity, as defined by I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic is greater than zero, we will explore the possible causes through subgroup analyses based on age of participants if adequate data are available.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The two included studies were non-randomized, retrospective, comparative studies. No explicit a priori inclusion or exclusion criteria were stated in either study. Other methodological discrepancies that could have influenced the validity of results in these studies, besides the selection bias due to lack of randomization, are summarized in the 'characteristics of included studies' table. Both studies included both eyes of some patients. However, both eyes of a patient may not be considered independent and thus analyses in both the studies suffer from unit of analysis error and failure to correct for possible cluster effects.</P>

<P>We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this review since we did not find any randomized trials and data from the included non-randomized studies were not adequate. We did not analyze results from <LINK REF="STD-Kubota-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubota 2003</LINK> since allocation, though non-randomized, did not take past history of acute attacks into consideration. Data from only a subgroup of patients without a past history of acute angle-closure was to be considered. Consequently only two patients were eligible in the extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) and goniosynechialysis group, rendering any analyses unhelpful. Results are tabulated in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and are summarized below.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1998</LINK> used criteria discussed in <LINK REF="REF-Greve-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greve 1982</LINK> to classify visual field measurements and progression of visual field loss. In the ECCE with PCIOL group 5/22 eyes showed definite deterioration of visual field compared to 5/25 eyes in the trabeculectomy group (risk ratio (RR) 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 3.56).

<P>Mean IOP at final follow up alone was reported. Mean follow up was 52.4 months (range 15 to 90 months) in the ECCE with PCIOL group and 50.4 months (range 6 to 83 months) in the trabeculectomy group. Mean difference for IOP change (the difference in mean IOP change between the two groups) was -2.40 mm Hg (95% CI -7.36 to 2.56).</P>

<P>Progression of visual acuity loss was defined as worsening by at least one Snellen line in <LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1998</LINK>. There was just one eye with visual acuity worsening in ECCE with PCIOL group, resulting in wide confidence intervals.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Our search of multiple databases including CENTRAL did not identify a single randomized trial addressing this important clinical question. Furthermore, although we conducted an extensive search of the literature to identify non-randomized studies, the strategy we used has not been validated and shown to be 100% sensitive.</P>
<P>We identified two non-randomized comparative studies evaluating extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation in chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubota-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubota 2003</LINK>). Both studies suffered from methodological inadequacies that limit any conclusions that can be drawn from the findings, particularly the lack of random allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Kubota-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubota 2003</LINK> included patients with a past history of acute attacks, precluding any analyses on our part for this review. </P>
<P>The little information from these studies suggests no evidence of benefit with lens extraction in terms of progression of visual field loss and mean change in intraocular pressure (IOP). Results of analyses on visual acuity and postoperative anti-glaucoma medications in <LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kubota-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubota 2003</LINK> are limited by the small number of patients analyzed. Further, both studies included both eyes of some of the patients resulting in a unit of analysis error. </P>
<P>Primary angle-closure glaucoma is due mainly to anatomic factors within the eye contributing to relative papillary block with narrowing of the anterior chamber angle resulting in obstruction to drainage of aqueous humor. As discussed under the 'epidemiology and pathogenesis' sections above, the lens contributes to angle obstruction through an independent mechanism as well, due to anterior location of the lens or increased lens thickness. Replacement of the lens with an intraocular lens was shown to result in an increase in anterior chamber depth, widening of the angle and increase in anterior chamber angle depth by gonioscopic measurements in <LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1998</LINK> and using ultrasound biomicroscopy measurements in patients undergoing cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kurimoto-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurimoto 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nonaka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nonaka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2003</LINK>). Similar findings were reported using Scheimpflug photography in PACG patients undergoing cataract extraction (<LINK REF="STD-Hayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hayashi 2000</LINK>). These findings support the biological plausibility of cataract extraction being beneficial to patients with chronic PACG as do other non-comparative studies discussed below. Presumably the main mechanism of glaucomatous optic nerve damage in PACG is elevation of IOP. If lens extraction is shown reliably to lower IOP in PACG as well as other procedures then the relative safety of cataract surgery might justify greater use of this treatment modality. Of course the ultimate goal of PACG treatment is to prevent additional damage to the optic nerve in order to slow or stop visual field progression. Future studies will want to assess the impact of treatments on both IOP and visual field. </P>
<P>Several non-comparative studies provide information supporting the role of lens extraction in chronic angle-closure glaucoma in relieving the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to an elevation of IOP in such patients discussed in earlier sections of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Acton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Acton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunning-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gunning 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hayashi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hayashi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wishart-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wishart 1989</LINK>). A more recent study reported similar findings in patients with the possibility of a reduced effect when peripheral anterior synechiae cover three-fourths or more of the angle (<LINK REF="REF-Euswas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euswas 2005</LINK>). All patients in this study had a history of Nd-YAG laser peripheral iridotomy and had varying degrees of peripheral anterior synechiae. While such studies suggest feasibility of the procedure and biological plausibility of lens extraction in addressing the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to an increased IOP in patients with chronic PACG, they do not provide evidence of effectiveness of the procedure. Also, none of these studies compared lens extraction with alternative treatment options for patients with PACG. </P>
<P>Our analyses do not provide adequate evidence on the effects of lens extraction as a therapeutic modality for patients with chronic PACG. Updates of this review will include any randomized trials conducted that meet eligibility criteria as per the 'criteria for including studies in this review' section above.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was not enough evidence to assess the superiority of lens extraction over any other means of controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) or visual field loss in patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), although this approach seems biologically plausible. The benefits of cataract extraction on vision are known, and were not the primary focus of this review. Clinical practice decisions will have to be based on physician judgment given this lack of data in the literature.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is no evidence of effects of lens extraction in chronic PACG from well-conducted randomized controlled trials. Trials comparing lens extraction (with or without goniosynechialysis) with trabeculectomy for patients in whom pupillary block is alleviated with either iridotomy or surgical peripheral iridectomy will help clinical decision making. Comparisons with medical therapy, laser iridotomy and laser iridoplasty will also be of interest. Since patients with a history of acute attacks of angle-closure may be substantially different from those with asymptomatic disease, stratification by this variable should be adopted in studies including both types of patients. Though most forms of therapy for glaucoma are aimed at controlling IOP, adequate data on visual field changes using validated methods and validated definitions, visual acuity, vision-related quality of life and economic outcomes will help in evaluating different interventions for this condition appropriately. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Type of study: Retrospective cohort study.</P>
<P>Were the criteria for allocation of participants to the treatment and control groups explicitly reported? No. Criteria were not clearly defined. The authors do not explain how participants were allocated to treatment arms.</P>
<P>Can the above criteria be explicitly related to the outcome? Yes. Patient selection could have influenced the outcome if some with a presumed better prognosis were allocated into one arm over another.</P>
<P>Was there evidence of a consecutive sample or a clearly defined patient population or some other method to minimize the chance that clinicians preferentially selected patients with favorable outcomes or that patients with better outcomes volunteered? No evidence. No information on how patients were selected to receive the two interventions.</P>
<P>How were the controls selected? Not explained.</P>
<P>Was the control group representative of the underlying population? Unclear: Cannot tell from the publication.</P>
<P>Were appropriate statistical/ case-mix methods used to adjust for confounding factors? Sample size was small, and the authors report that age, preoperative IOP, and number of preoperative ocular hypotensive medicines were not statistically significantly different. Residual confounding may have existed. There was no adjustment in the analyses.</P>
<P>Were the factors adjusted for in the analyses, specified a priori? No adjustments were made.</P>
<P>Was the measurement of the confounding factors in the participants consistently adequate? No. The gonioscopic appearance at baseline should have been included. Also, there is no report on the consistency of gonioscopic measurements.</P>
<P>Was consistency achieved in allocation, administration of treatments and recording of the treatments? Unclear.</P>
<P>Was the treatment/intervention confirmed in an objective way and not determined exclusively by self reports? Yes. The intervention was a surgical procedure.</P>
<P>Was outcome assessment conducted in a masked fashion (if the study was prospective)? Unclear.</P>
<P>Were criteria/protocols for outcome assessment standardized and/or pre-specified? Were there deviations from the protocol? Unclear.</P>
<P>Was the method of outcome assessment valid? Unclear.</P>
<P>Was outcome assessed in the same way in both groups? No - IOP assessment in lens extraction group was preceded by an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and it is not clear if the IOP in this group was also obtained from diurnal curves.</P>
<P>Losses to follow-up and reasons for loss to follow-up: controls: 0. Cases: 1 eye, which needed filtration surgery was not analyzed.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Country: The Netherlands.<BR/>Study period: 1987 to 1994.<BR/>Age: Mean (SD) was 66.5 (9.7) years in lens extraction group and 64.6 (11.9) years in trabeculectomy group.<BR/>Gender: 61% in lens extraction group and 79% in trabeculectomy group were females.<BR/>Inclusion criteria: no explicit inclusion criteria reported. Patients in lens extraction group were selected based on gonioscopic appearance as evaluated by a single author. Patients in the control group underwent trabeculectomy during the same period.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: no explicit exclusion criteria mentioned.<BR/>Equivalence of baseline characteristics: baseline age appears lower in controls but difference was not statistically significant. Similar in preoperative IOP values. One patient in lens extraction group had 20/200 visual acuity pre-operatively while 5 patients in trabeculectomy group had preoperative visual acuity of 20/200 or worse.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Cases or Intervention 1 or Cases: extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL). Subconjunctival steroids and pilocarpine ointment were given after the surgical procedure. <BR/>Number of participants (eyes): 18 (22)</P>
<P>Control or Intervention 2: trabeculectomy with postoperative 5-Fluorouracil administered in 6 eyes.<BR/>Number of participants (eyes): 19 (25)<BR/>Length of follow up: Planned: not stated. Actual: lens extraction group, range 15 to 90 months; trabeculectomy group, range 11 to 83 months.<BR/>

</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome as defined in the study: no explicit primary outcome stated a priori. Main results were focused on mean IOP.<BR/>Measurement of primary outcome in the study: not clearly reported.<BR/>Secondary outcomes as defined in the study: best-corrected visual acuity; postoperative anti-glaucoma medication use; visual field and gonioscopic findings.<BR/>Measurement of secondary outcomes in the study: visual acuity was measured using Snellen charts, no information on measurement of visual field. Goldmann 3-mirror goniolens was used to evaluate the angle.<BR/>Intervals at which outcome assessed: no specific intervals reported.<BR/>Reported information on cost of interventions: none.<BR/>Reported information on quality of life: none.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Type of study: retrospective cohort study.</P>
<P>Were the criteria for allocation of participants to the treatment and control groups explicitly reported? Yes, those with broad PAS in two or more quadrants had combined procedures.</P>
<P>Can the above criteria be explicitly related to the outcome? Yes, the presence of PAS may be associated with worse IOP outcome.</P>
<P>Was there evidence of a consecutive sample or a clearly defined patient population or some other method to minimize the chance that clinicians preferentially selected patients with favorable outcomes or that patients with better outcomes volunteered? No.</P>
<P>How were the controls selected? The indication for an additional goniosynechialysis procedure was a broad peripheral synechiae of more than 2 quadrants observed by intraoperative Swan gonioscopy. </P>
