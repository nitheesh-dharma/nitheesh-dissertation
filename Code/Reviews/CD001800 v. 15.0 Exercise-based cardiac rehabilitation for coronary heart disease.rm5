We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and Science Citation Index Expanded (December 2009 to July 2014).</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-05 08:42:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months&#8217; follow-up, compared with a no exercise control. The study population comprised men and women of all ages who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or who have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We included RCTs that reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, MI, revascularisations, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life (HRQL), or costs.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-09 16:16:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>Two review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One author extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data. We stratified meta-analysis by the duration of follow up of trials, i.e. short-term: 6 to 12 months, medium-term: 13 to 36 months, and long-term: &gt; 3 years.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-20 14:03:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review included 63 trials which randomised 14,486 people with CHD. This latest update identified 16 new trials (3872 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients and the mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 47.5 to 71.0 years. Women accounted for fewer than 15% of the patients recruited. Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality of reporting in more recent trials.</P><P>As we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting findings pooled across all trials at their longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with no exercise control (27 trials; risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). There was no reduction in total mortality with CR (47 trials, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The overall risk of hospital admissions was reduced with CR (15 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI (36 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04), CABG (29 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16) or PCI (18 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04).</P><P>There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for all event outcomes, and there was evidence of small study bias for MI and hospitalisation, but no other outcome. Predictors of clinical outcomes were examined across the longest follow-up of studies using univariate meta-regression. Results show that benefits in outcomes were independent of participants' CHD case mix (proportion of patients with MI), type of CR (exercise only vs comprehensive rehabilitation) dose of exercise, length of follow-up, trial publication date, setting (centre vs home-based), study location (continent), sample size or risk of bias.</P><P>Given the heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting methods, meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL. In five out of 20 trials reporting HRQL using validated measures, there was evidence of significant improvement in most or all of the sub-scales with exercise-based CR compared to control at follow-up. Four trial-based economic evaluation studies indicated exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years.</P><P>The quality of the evidence for outcomes reported in the review was rated using the GRADE method. The quality of the evidence varied widely by outcome and ranged from low to moderate.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-20 15:07:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality. We saw a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation with CR but not in the risk of MI or revascularisation. We identified further evidence supporting improved HRQL with exercise-based CR. More recent trials were more likely to be well reported and include older and female patients. However, the population studied in this review still consists predominantly of lower risk individuals following MI or revascularisation. Further well conducted RCTs are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based CR in higher risk CHD groups and also those presenting with stable angina. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical event outcomes including mortality and hospital admissions, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-27 18:19:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-09 16:23:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-31 12:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally, with 7.4 million deaths in 2013, accounting for one-third of all deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). In the United Kingdom (UK), an estimated 2.3 million people live with CHD and the condition accounts for one in five deaths in men and one in ten deaths in women (<LINK REF="REF-Nichols-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichols 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 2012</LINK>). Although the mortality rate from CHD has been falling in the UK, primarily due to evidence-based treatments and reductions in major risk factors, principally smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Unal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unal 2004</LINK>), it has fallen more slowly in those aged less than 55 years, and less than in many other developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Nichols-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichols 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 2012</LINK>). With falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-05 08:59:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>Many definitions of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) have been proposed. The following definition encompasses the key concepts of CR: &#8220;The coordinated sum of activities required to influence favourably the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, as well as to provide the best possible physical, mental and social conditions, so that the patients may, by their own efforts, preserve or resume optimal functioning in their community and through improved health behaviour, slow or reverse progression of disease&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-BACPR-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BACPR 2012</LINK>). Cardiac rehabilitation is a complex intervention that may involve a variety of therapies, including exercise, risk factor education, behaviour change, psychological support, and strategies that are aimed at targeting traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Cardiac rehabilitation is an essential part of contemporary heart disease care and is considered a priority in countries with a high prevalence of CHD. Indeed, based on evidence from previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>), CR following a cardiac event is a Class I recommendation from the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, with exercise therapy consistently identified as a central element (<LINK REF="REF-Balady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balady 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perk-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perk 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>). However, despite the recommendations for exercise-based CR as an integral component of comprehensive cardiac care of patients with CHD (particularly those following myocardial infarction (MI), revascularisation or with angina pectoris) and heart failure, a substantial proportion of patients do not receive it (<LINK REF="REF-Bethell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethell 2008</LINK>). Service provision, though predominantly hospital-based, varies markedly, and referral, enrolment and completion are sub-optimal, especially among women and older people (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2012</LINK>). Home-based CR programmes have been increasingly introduced to widen access and participation (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2010</LINK>), and interventions aimed at improving patient uptake and adherence to CR programmes have been adopted (<LINK REF="REF-Karmali-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karmali 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Exercise-based CR is remarkably safe. An observational study of more than 25,000 patients undergoing CR reported one cardiac event for 50,000 hours of exercise training, equivalent to 1.3 cardiac arrests per million patient-hours (<LINK REF="REF-Pavy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavy 2006</LINK>). An earlier study reported one case of ventricular fibrillation per 111,996 patient-hours of exercise and one MI per 294,118 patient-hours (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Camp-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Camp 1986</LINK>). Patients with unstable angina, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, and severe heart failure (New York Heart Association level 4) have been considered at high risk, with careful assessment recommended before they engage in the exercise component of CR.

However, findings of the original Cochrane review of exercise-based CR for CHD (<LINK REF="REF-Jolliffe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolliffe 2001</LINK>) supported the hypothesis that reductions in mortality may also be mediated via the indirect effects of exercise through improvements in the risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (i.e. lipids, smoking and blood pressure) (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2006</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-09 16:23:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2011 which identified 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomising a total of 10,794 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2011</LINK>). A reduction in overall and cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio (RR): 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99 and RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) and hospital admissions (RR 0.69,95% CI 0.51 to 0.93) in the shorter term (trials with follow up &#8804;12 months follow-up) was reported with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect across trials. Exercise-based CR was not found to reduce the risk of morbidity in terms of the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or risk of revascularisation. Given both the heterogeneity in outcome measure and methods of reporting findings, a meta-analysis was not undertaken for health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes, although there was evidence of a higher level of HRQL with exercise-based CR than usual care in the seven (out of 10) trials reporting validated HRQL outcome measures.</P><P>The 2011 review identified a number of limitations in the available RCT evidence, the most notable of which are listed below.</P><UL><LI>Under-representation of women, elderly people, and other cardiac groups (post revascularisation and angina pectoris).</LI><LI>Poor reporting of methodology and results in many trial publications. The method of randomisation, allocation, concealment, or blinding of outcomes assessment was rarely described. Furthermore, incomplete outcome data (primarily due to losses to follow-up or dropouts) were insufficiently addressed in most trials. Losses to follow-up were relatively high across trials (approximately one third of trials reported a greater than 20% loss to follow-up) but reasons for dropout were often not reported.</LI><LI>Several trials excluded significant numbers of patients post-randomisation, and thus in an intention-to-treat analysis, these patients were regarded as dropouts. This may be partly explained by the fact that the majority of trials were not designed (or powered) to assess treatment group differences in mortality and morbidity but instead surrogate measures of treatment efficacy, such as exercise capacity or cardiac risk factor levels.</LI><LI>Lack of robust evidence for the impact on HRQL, costs and cost-effectiveness.</LI></UL><P>The 2011 review authors concluded that well designed and adequately reported RCTs in groups of CHD patients more representative of usual clinical practice are needed. It was also recommended that these trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical events including hospital admission, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.</P><P>Using additional RCT evidence published since the 2011 Cochrane review, the aim of this update was to reassess the effectiveness of exercise-based CR compared to usual care on mortality, risk of hospital admissions, myocardial infarction, revascularisation, HRQL, and costs and cost-effectiveness in patients with CHD.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Changes in this update review</HEADING><P>In addition to updating the searches, given the increased number of RCTs reporting longer follow up, this update review has stratified the results of meta-analyses according to time of follow-up: short-term, 6-12 months; medium-term,13-36 months; and long-term, &gt; 36 months (follow-up is likely to be a key driver of intervention effect), and has assessed the quality of the evidence for reported outcomes using the GRADE framework (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-10-05 10:43:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><UL><LI>To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity and HRQL in patients with CHD.</LI><LI>To explore the potential study level predictors of the effectiveness of exercise-based CR in patients with CHD.</LI></UL></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2015-10-26 21:09:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-05 09:29:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2015-02-09 10:04:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We sought RCTs of exercise-based CR versus usual care with a follow-up period of at least six months.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2015-10-05 09:20:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>We included men and women of all ages, in both hospital-based and community-based settings, who have had a MI, or who had undergone revascularisation (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography.</P><P>We excluded studies which only included participants following heart valve surgery, with heart failure, with atrial fibrillation, with heart transplants, or implanted with either cardiac-resynchronisation therapy (CRT) or implantable defibrillators (ICD).

We added new search terms to expand the search to include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and related interventions, and also angina-related conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We also added terms relating to education and psychological interventions to better reflect the comprehensive nature of CR. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL using a strategy combining selected MeSH terms and free text terms relating to exercise-based rehabilitation and coronary heart disease with filters applied to limit to humans and RCTs.The RCT filter for MEDLINE was the Cochrane sensitivity-maximising RCT filter, and for EMBASE, terms recommended in the Cochrane Handbook were applied (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). Adaptations of this filter were applied to CINAHL and Web of Science. We translated the MEDLINE search strategy into the other databases using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. We applied date limits to the previously used search terms, and limited searches in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> by publication years 2009-2014. We applied the new terms without time limits. We imposed no language or other limitations and gave consideration to variations in terms used and spellings of terms in different countries so that studies were not missed by the search strategy because of such variations.

We also assessed three further quality criteria: whether the study groups were balanced at baseline, if the study groups received comparable care (apart from the exercise component of the intervention), and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken. The criteria used for assessing these last three risk of bias domains are as follows.</P><P><B>Groups balanced at baseline</B></P><UL><LI><I>Low risk of bias</I>: the characteristics of the participants in the intervention and control groups at baseline is reported to be comparable or can be judged to be comparable (e.g. baseline data reported in Table 1) in terms of likely main prognostic factors.</LI><LI><I>Uncertain risk of bias</I>: it is not reported whether the participants' characteristics in the two groups are balanced at baseline and there is inadequate information reported (e.g. no Table 1) to assess this.</LI><LI><I>High risk of bias</I>: there is evidence of substantive imbalance in the baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups with regard to likely major prognostic factors.</LI></UL><P><B>Intention-to-treat analysis </B></P><UL><LI><I>Low risk of bias</I>: the trial reports that the analyses were conducted according to an intention-to-treat analysis, and includes all the principles of such an analysis, e.g. keeping participants in the intervention groups to which they were randomised, regardless of the intervention they actually received; and measures outcome data on all or the majority of participants (i.e. &gt; 80% of those randomised) or includes imputation of all missing data in the analysis, using appropriate methodology, e.g. multiple imputation.</LI><LI><I>Uncertain risk of bias</I>: it is unclear if the trial has performed an intention-to-treat analysis.</LI><LI><I>High risk of bias</I>: the trial does not include an intention-to-treat analysis, or there is a substantive loss of outcome data (e.g. &gt; 20%) and analyses are performed according to imputation methods known to create bias such as last observation carried forward.</LI></UL><P><B>Groups received comparable treatment (except exercise)</B></P><UL><LI><I>Low risk of bias</I>: all co-interventions were delivered equally across intervention and control groups.</LI><LI><I>Uncertain risk of bias</I>: there was insufficient information to access whether co-interventions were equally delivered across groups.</LI><LI><I>High risk of bias:</I> the co-interventions were not delivered equally across intervention and control groups.</LI></UL><P>All risk of bias assessments were checked by a second reviewer (RST) and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Dichotomous outcomes for each comparison have been expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If there was a statistically significant absolute risk difference, the associated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome was calculated. Heterogeneity amongst included studies was explored qualitatively, by comparing the characteristics of included studies, and quantitatively, using the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test of heterogeneity and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Given the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, we pooled data from each study using a random effects model. Compared with a fixed-effects, this model provides a more conservative statistical comparison of the difference between intervention and control by typically providing a wider confidence interval around the effect estimate. If a statistically significant difference was present using the random-effects model, we also reported the fixed effect pooled estimate and 95% CI because of the tendency of smaller trials, which are more susceptible to publication bias, to be over weighted with a random effects analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008b</LINK>).

Univariate meta-regression was undertaken to explore heterogeneity and examine potential treatment effect modifiers. We tested nine hypotheses that there may be differences in the effect of exercise-based CR on total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total MI, revascularisation (CABG and PCI) and hospitalisation across particular subgroups: (1) CHD case mix (MI-only trials versus other trials); (2) type of CR (exercise-only CR versus comprehensive CR); (3) 'dose' of exercise intervention [dose = number of weeks of exercise training x average number of sessions/week x average duration of session in minutes] (dose &#8805; 1000 units versus dose &lt; 1000 units); (4) follow-up period; (5) year of publication; (6) sample size; (7) setting (home- or centre-based CR); (8) risk of bias (low risk of bias in &lt; 5 out of 8 domains) ; and (9) study location (continent). Hypotheses (1) to (5) were defined a priori and (7) to (9) during this update.

Thirty eight studies compared comprehensive programmes (i.e. exercise plus education or psychological management, or both), while 24 reported on an exercise-only intervention. In addition, one study randomised patients to a comprehensive programme, exercise only intervention or usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Sivarajan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sivarajan 1982</LINK>). The majority of studies (37 studies, 59%) were undertaken in Europe, either as single (n = 45) or multicentre (n = 18) studies. Most trials were relatively small in sample size (median 126, range: 28-2304). Two large trials (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-West-2012" TYPE="STUDY">West 2012</LINK>) contributed about 30% (4997 participants) of all included participants. The median duration of trial intervention was six months (range 1 to 48) with median follow-up of 12 months (range 6 to 120) months. Patients with MI alone were recruited in 31 trials (49%); the remaining trials recruited patients suffering exclusively from angina (five trials), post-revascularisation patients (two trials) or a mixed population of patients with CHD. The mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 49.3 to 71.0 years. Although over half of the trials included women (42 studies, 67%), women accounted for less than 15% of the patients recruited overall. More recent trials were less dominated by MI patients and were more likely to include older and female participants.

However, as we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting the findings pooled across all trials at longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality, but not total mortality, compared with no exercise control. The risk of hospital admissions was reduced with exercise-based CR, but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI, CABG or PCI. Univariate meta-regression analysis shows that the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical events appears to be largely consistent across trials irrespective of case mix (percentage of post-MI participants), type of rehabilitation (exercise-only vs comprehensive), dose of exercise training, duration of follow-up, study location, risk of bias or sample size. Although meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL outcomes (due to the range of outcome measures and methods of reporting), there was evidence of significantly higher levels of HRQL with exercise-based CR than with usual care across a number of trials. The four trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in QALYs. The majority of participants included in this review were post-MI or post-revascularisation. More recent trials have recruited a greater proportion of female and older patients and some have employed technologies such as pedometers, the internet or mobile phones as a means of encouraging activity amongst participants. </P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-19 16:13:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The generalisability of the previous version of this review was limited as most included studies recruited predominantly younger men following MI or revascularisation. However, with the inclusion of more women and older participants in recent trials, and further data on the outcomes of hospitalisation and HRQL, the findings of this updated review potentially have greater external validity. </P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-08 14:39:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The general lack of reporting of methods in the included RCT reports made it difficult to assess their methodological quality and thereby judge their risk of bias. Largely due to this poor reporting, the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was evaluated as moderate at best. However, there appeared to be improvement in the quality of reporting in more recent trials. Several trials excluded significant numbers of patients post-randomisation, and thus in an intention-to-treat analysis, these patients have been regarded as dropouts. This may be partly explained by the fact that the majority of trials were not designed to assess treatment group differences in mortality and morbidity outcome but instead surrogate measures of treatment outcome, such as exercise capacity or risk factor levels. Reassuringly, meta-regression showed no significant association between the effect of CR compared to control and the level of risk of bias across trials. </P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We believe this is the most comprehensive systematic review to date of RCT-based evidence for the impact of exercise-based CR for people with CHD. However, our review has some limitations. Funnel plot asymmetry for the risk of MI and hospital admission is indicative of small-study bias and possible publication bias. Although a specific goal of this updated review was to clarify the impact of exercise training programmes on clinical events, many of the included trials were relatively small and of short-term follow-up so that the number of deaths and hospitalisations reported by most trials was small. Indeed, in many studies, we located event data in the trial descriptions of losses to follow-up and exclusions, rather than as stated primary or secondary outcomes. We also acknowledge that the median outcome follow-up of 12 months is limited when assessing for impact on mortality and morbidity outcome measures. However, our results were consistent when pooling was limited to RCTs with a follow up &gt; 12 months. In this updated review, we also sought to categorise the CHD diagnoses of trial participants according to a more detailed framework developed by one of the review team (ADZ) based on Braunwald's classification of CHD (<LINK REF="REF-Braunwald-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunwald 2011</LINK>) and current clinical management of CHD. However, given the lack of details of the patients included in the trials, this more detailed assessment of diagnostic groups did not prove possible. All participants in the included studies had documented CHD, the majority of the participants having suffered an MI or undergone revascularisation. As with the previous versions of this review, we have combined these different patient groups as there are insufficient data at present to stratify trials by type of CHD. </P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The findings of this updated review are largely in accord with the previous version of this review. However, unlike the 2011 review, although there was a trend towards a reduction in total mortality with exercise-based CR compared to no exercise control, this reduction failed to reach statistical significance. This is likely to be explained by the inclusion of more recent trials of mixed CHD populations which have been conducted in the era of optimal medical therapy. Given the proven survival advantage of contemporary medical treatments, and the limited opportunity for mortality gain in this patient cohort, any incremental total mortality benefit with exercise is likely to be small.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-23 14:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review shows that while exercise-based CR does not reduce total mortality, it does provide important benefits by reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation (and associated healthcare costs), and improving HRQL in younger men who have suffered MI or are post-revascularisation. While there was an increase in the proportion of female and older individuals in more recent trials, the application of this evidence base to a more poorly represented group, particularly angina pectoris and higher risk CHD patients, and those with major co-morbidities, remains a question of clinical judgement. There appears to be little to choose between exercise-only or exercise in combination with psychosocial or educational CR interventions. In the absence of definitive cost-effectiveness comparing psychosocial or educational approaches to exercise-based CR, it would be rational to use cost considerations to determine practice.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-05 13:00:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell"><P>In spite of incorporation of recent trial evidence including more older and female patients, the population of CHD patients studied in this review update remains predominately low risk middle-aged males following MI or revascularisation. Therefore, well-designed, and adequately reported RCTs of CR in groups of CHD patients more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, need to explicitly report clinical events including mortality and hospital admission, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, further details of the presentation and diagnoses of CHD participants and interventions offered and received should be reported in trials, so that results of future reviews can better stratify outcomes according to the range of CHD populations or types of CR interventions.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2015-03-09 15:57:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We would like to thank Zhivko Zhelev, Shenqiu Zhang and Oriana Ciani for their translation services, and Harriot Hunt for her assistance with screening titles and abstracts.

The programme will be performed in the hospital and it will start within the three days after the exercise stress test. It will comprise three hours a week (spread over three alternate days) of supervised exercise training for 10 weeks. The intervention will end after 10 weeks, regardless of whether the patients have completed 30 sessions. Exercise classes will be supervised by a physiotherapist and will consist of 10 minutes of warm-up and muscle stretching, 30 minutes of aerobic exercises (cycloergometer), 15 minutes of isotonic exercises for the upper and lower extremities and 5 minutes of cool-down. Moreover, instructions will be given on self-pulse counting, subjective perception of effort using the Borg scale, relaxation exercises, breathing techniques, postural health and minimising physical effort. Aerobic exercise intensity will be between 75-90% of the maximum heart rate obtained in the previous exercise stress test and progressing according to the rating of perceived exertion (RPE: Borg scale 11&#8211;15).</P><P>Resistance training will be performed with 10&#8211;15 repetitions for three sets, maintaining an RPE of 11&#8211;14.

It is caused when the walls of your coronary arteries become narrowed by a gradual build-up of atheroma, allowing too little blood flow to the heart from the coronary arteries.</P><P><B>Echocardiogram</B>: often referred to as a cardiac echo or simply an echo, is a sonogram of the heart. Echocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.</P><P><B>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</B>: is a test that checks for problems with the electrical activity of your heart. An ECG shows the heart's electrical activity as line tracings on paper. The spikes and dips in the tracings are called waves. The heart is a muscular pump made up of four chambers.</P><P><B>Heart attack</B>: (Myocardial infarction [MI] or acute myocardial infarction [AMI]), occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart, starving it of oxygen and causing damage to the heart muscle.</P><P><B>Heart failure (HF)</B>: often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the needs of yourbody.</P><P><B>Heart rate</B>: The number of times your heart beats in a minute.</P><P><B>Implantable Cardiovertor Defibrillator (ICD)</B>: A device implanted within your chest wall to monitor your heart's rhythm. If there is a dangerous abnormal rhythm the ICD can treat it by giving your heart an electric shock.</P><P><B>Intermittent claudication</B>: A cramp like pain mostly in your calf and leg muscles which is caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. It is often brought on by walking and relieved by rest.</P><P><B>Ischaemia</B>: a restriction in blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed.</P><P><B>Ischaemic heart disease (IHD): </B>see Coronary heart disease (CHD)</P><P><B>Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI): </B>commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle.</P><P><B>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): </B>commonly known as coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease. </P><P><B>Re-vascularisation: </B>A procedure that either opens up the existing blood vessels or bypasses the blockage of the coronary arteries.</P><P><B>Risk factor for coronary heart disease:</B> Something that can increase your risk of getting coronary heart disease.
