<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does the evidence support the use of propofol as an effective drug in reducing total blood loss and improving quality of the surgical field in people undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) with induced hypotension, compared to inhalational (gas) anaesthetics and other drugs? This review updates the evidence published in 2013, and is current to February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>FESS is a minimally invasive technique used to treat patients with chronic sinusitis (inflammation of the mucous membrane in the air cavities within the facial bones, and fluid within the cavity for more than 12 weeks). The surgeon uses a miniature camera in the nose to get a close-up view of the sinuses. The main problem is that bleeding during the operation will obscure the view and cause the procedure to take longer, with an increased risk of damage to the surrounding structures (eyes and brain). One method for reducing bleeding under general anaesthesia is induced hypotension, which involves deliberately lowering the blood pressure to below normal in order to improve the surgical field. However, lowering the blood pressure carries its own risks including permanent brain damage, delayed awakening, blood clot in the brain, insufficient blood flow to the brain, and death. Propofol (an anaesthetic drug given intravenously) and volatile anaesthetic agents (given as inhaled gas) are alternative methods for reducing blood pressure during the anaesthetic period.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included four studies in our review (278 participants). The studies were conducted between 2003 and 2010. Although all four included studies were randomized, some elements of their methodology suggest a low to unclear risk of bias in all trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that propofol did not reduce measured overall blood loss in either children or adults (2 studies; 158 participants). Propofol might improve the quality of the surgical field a little (4 studies; 277 participants), but there was no difference in operation time (3 studies; 214 participants). Propofol was more reliable in achieving induced hypotension (1 study; 88 participants). No studies reported any adverse effects from induced hypotension with propofol.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found only four studies, which included a small total number of participants. The evidence from the studies were of moderate to very low quality, and therefore our results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to confirm whether any important benefit is associated with the use of propofol.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-04 07:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive technique that is used to treat chronic sinusitis. Small bleeding areas can reduce operative visibility and result in destruction of surrounding structures. Deliberate hypotension (lowering the mean arterial blood pressure to between 50 and 65 mm Hg in normotensive patients) using a range of pharmacological agents during general anaesthesia reduces blood loss in many operations. This review was originally published in 2013 and updated in February 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to compare the use of propofol versus other techniques for achieving deliberate intraoperative hypotension during FESS procedures with regard to blood loss and operative conditions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:00:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We searched the following databases in the updated review: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2016), Embase (1980 to February 2016), LILACS (1982 to February 2016), and ISI Web of Science (1946 to February 2016). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings and contacted the authors of included trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We sought all randomized controlled trials comparing propofol with other techniques for deliberate hypotension during FESS with regard to blood loss and operative conditions in both adults and children. Our primary outcome was total blood loss (TBL). Other outcomes included surgical field quality, operation time, mortality within 24 hours, complications, and failure to reach target blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from the reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We made all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis where possible. When I<SUP>2 </SUP>was less than 40% and the P value from the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test was higher than 0.10, we pooled data using the fixed-effect model. Otherwise, we pooled data using the random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found no new studies. This updated review therefore includes four studies with 278 participants. Most analyses were based on data from few participants and low-quality evidence, so our results should be interpreted with caution. Deliberate hypotension with propofol did not decrease TBL (millilitres) when compared with inhalation anaesthetics in either children (1 study; 70 participants; very low-quality evidence), or adults (1 study; 88 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Propofol improved the quality of the surgical field by less than one category on a scale from 0 (no bleeding) to 5 (severe bleeding) (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.37; 4 studies; 277 participants; low-quality evidence), but no difference in operation time was reported (3 studies; 214 participants; low-quality evidence). Failure to lower blood pressure to target was less common in the propofol group (risk ratio of failure with propofol 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.66; 1 study; 88 participants; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Using propofol to achieve deliberate hypotension probably improves the surgical field, but the effect is small. Deliberate hypotension with propofol did not decrease TBL and the operation time. However, due to the very low quality of the evidence, this conclusion is not definitive. Randomized controlled trials with good-quality methodology and large sample size are required to investigate the effectiveness of deliberate hypotension with propofol for FESS.<BR/>

<P>Chronic sinusitis is a common disease in any age group and may be defined as inflammation of the mucous membrane in the paranasal sinuses and fluid within the sinus cavity that lasts longer than 12 weeks. The primary treatments for chronic sinusitis are antibiotics and topical nasal steroids. Surgery is usually considered if these measures are unsuccessful (<LINK REF="REF-Dessouky-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dessouky 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rimmer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimmer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanez 2003</LINK>). The most common procedure is functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). In this minimally invasive technique, the sinus air cells and openings into the nose (ostia) are opened under direct visualization through an endoscopic technique (<LINK REF="REF-Catalano-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalano 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khalil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalil 2006</LINK>), thereby restoring sinus ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Stammberger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stammberger 1991</LINK>). The use of FESS is now widely accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Dessouky-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dessouky 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Georgalas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgalas 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khalil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalil 2006</LINK>), and the number of FESS procedures that are performed has grown (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Danielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielsen 2003</LINK>). Compared with other more traditional methods, endoscopic sinus surgery is associated with fewer complications and greater symptomatic improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dessouky-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dessouky 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rimmer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimmer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2014</LINK>), including less postoperative pain, no external scars, and more rapid recovery. Complications related to FESS include bleeding into the nose that obscures the surgical field, bleeding into adjacent structures (including around the eyes), damage to the structures around the eye, epiphora (excessive tear production), loss of vision, cerebrospinal fluid leak, damage to intracranial structures, and death (<LINK REF="REF-Georgalas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgalas 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maniglia-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniglia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reinhart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinhart 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rimmer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimmer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stankiewicz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankiewicz 2001</LINK>). The main problem in practice is intraoperative bleeding, because even small areas of bleeding can reduce visibility during FESS, which can result in abandonment of the procedure or unintentional destruction of surrounding structures.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:31:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deliberate hypotension can reduce blood loss in many situations, including orthopaedic surgery, maxillofacial surgery, and spine surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dutton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobias-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobias 2002</LINK>). The aim of any technique of deliberate hypotension during general anaesthesia is to lower the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to values between 50 and 65 mm Hg in patients with normal blood pressure, with the goal of significantly reducing blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Cincikas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cincikas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dutton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutton 2012</LINK>). Although the precise mechanism varies with the technique used, deliberate hypotension is usually the result of a reduction in cardiac output, blood pressure, or a combination of these factors (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>). Deliberate hypotension can reduce blood loss in FESS by between 80 and 141 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Cincikas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cincikas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elsharnouby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elsharnouby 2006</LINK>). However, deliberate hypotension is not without potential complications, which include permanent cerebral damage, delayed awakening, cerebral thrombosis, brain ischaemias, and death (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Techniques for deliberate hypotension include controlling venous return (for example through positioning of the patient) and providing various pharmacological interventions including volatile anaesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane), direct-acting vasodilator drugs (sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, hydralazine), trimetaphan, alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (phentolamine, urapidil), selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist (dexmedetomidine), beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (propranolol, esmolol), combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (labetalol), calcium channel blockers (nicardipine), and prostaglandin E1 (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodds-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodds 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shams-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shams 2013</LINK>). Disadvantages are associated with each of these approaches. For example, the use of nitroprusside or nitroglycerine may require escalating doses because of tachyphylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>), nitroprusside in large doses can result in cyanide intoxication (<LINK REF="REF-Bendo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendo 2001</LINK>), and both require invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>). Volatile anaesthetics can prolong recovery and delay discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-08 15:28:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More recently, deliberate hypotension using the anaesthetic agent propofol has become popular. Propofol is commonly used during anaesthesia both as an induction agent and for maintenance of anaesthesia. It induces a state of general anaesthesia by facilitating inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2015</LINK>). Propofol has rapid onset and recovery times with a short half-life and duration of action (<LINK REF="REF-Darnobid-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darnobid 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reves-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reves 2005</LINK>). Disadvantages of propofol are that it is painful on injection and administration can decrease arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. Changes in blood pressure can be rapidly achieved in response to bolus doses or infusion, as required (<LINK REF="REF-Reves-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reves 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:32:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For achieving deliberate hypotension, many studies have found that propofol seemed to be more effective in reducing blood loss than volatile anaesthetics (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodds-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodds 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavlin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pavlin 1999</LINK>). If propofol is superior to alternative agents in attaining deliberate hypotension for FESS, then this would be important information for the anaesthetist in choosing the more appropriate technique. If, on the other hand, any clear disadvantages are associated with propofol, this information would be equally important to the clinical practitioner.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-01 07:07:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from two studies contributing data to the primary outcome of this review suggests that deliberate hypotension with propofol may reduce the measured TBL in adults and children compared to a volatile agent (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2010</LINK>), but the studies have insufficient power to confirm or refute this suggestion. A statistically significant improvement in the quality of the surgical field was observed with deliberate hypotension using propofol when compared with deliberate hypotension using inhalation anaesthetics (mean difference = 0.64 on a 6-point scale) with low-quality evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tirelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tirelli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wormald-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wormald 2005</LINK>). This is a small improvement (less than one category), and it is unclear whether this difference is clinically important. Operation time did not differ between groups, with low-quality evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wormald-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wormald 2005</LINK>). A single study comparing propofol with isoflurane found fewer failures of deliberate hypotension with the use of propofol (risk ratio 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.66) with moderate-quality evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>). No deaths were reported in any of the included studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-04 08:08:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main limitation of our findings is the small number of studies. This review includes findings from only four trials, and the evidence was insufficient to allow firm conclusions to be drawn for many of our outcome measures, particularly as these studies did not report on many of our clinical outcomes, including adverse effects. The overall applicability of the results of this review is limited because we have been unable to perform an adequate assessment of benefit to risk.</P>
<P>We were unable to perform any of our planned subgroup analyses, but of the two studies reporting our primary outcome, one enrolled children (<LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2010</LINK>), and the other adults (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>). We were unable to perform sensitivity analysis by risk of bias or to determine the effect of allocating missing data because of insufficient data.</P>
<P>Even though this review suggests a slightly lower quality of the surgical field with inhalational agents compared with propofol, results may lack clinical significance because of the small difference. Some of the included studies had unclear random sequence generation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Despite the many drugs that have been used to induce deliberate hypotension during general anaesthesia, such as vasodilators, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, dexmedetomidine, and opioids, only trials of propofol and inhalational anaesthetic agents have been reported with deliberate hypotension. Studies compared propofol with isoflurane (three studies), sevoflurane (five studies), and desflurane (one study). However, they did not keep mean arterial blood pressure below 65 mm Hg to achieve the definition of deliberate hypotension, so we added them to excluded studies.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-04 08:11:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found the evidence for most outcomes to be of moderate, low or very low quality, primarily due to risk of bias (for details see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Two studies included a small number of participants, leading to imprecision of result.</P>
<P>The effect of propofol on quality of the surgical field may have been biased because all of the included trials used a combination of propofol and remifentanil (an ultra-short-acting opioid) during the operation, and in the inhalation anaesthetics group, all participants received a longer-acting opioid (alfentanil or fentanyl). Propofol was therefore not the only difference in the therapeutic regimen, and these data should be properly interpreted as the effect of 'propofol with remifentanil by infusion' compared with 'volatile anaesthesia plus intermittent fentanyl or alfentanil'. This is an important qualification to our findings, because remifentanil has been shown to be effective in improving the surgical field. For example, one RCT showed that propofol and remifentanil during deliberate hypotension improved the surgical field for tympanoplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Degoute-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degoute 2001</LINK>). This may be mediated through the effect of remifentanil on lowering heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Remifentanil can be rapidly titrated to produce the desired level of analgesia, which may contribute to the achievement of a target arterial blood pressure and may be at least in part responsible for the apparent success of propofol in this regard. The lack of standardized grading for surgical field among studies was a limitation, with studies using a 6-point scale surgical field, 10 cm visual analogue scale, and 11-point scale surgical field; reliability (inter-rater, intrarater) should be a concern.</P>
<P>Measurement of blood loss during FESS is difficult and may be inaccurate in these trials. Concealed blood loss (especially loss into the gut), although presumably similar across all groups, may be associated with underestimation of losses. In any case, only two trials reported this outcome.</P>
<P>Finally, although we could not find any difference in mortality or morbidity between the techniques examined in this review, this should not be taken to mean that we can exclude such consequences with any confidence. Adverse events are rare during FESS (for example the mortality rate has been reported to be 0.02% to 0.34% (<LINK REF="REF-Aken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aken 2000</LINK>)), and a much larger data set would be required to reliably confirm or refute any effects of using propofol instead of an inhalational agent. In general, reliable conclusions may therefore not be drawn from the four included studies.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:38:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We followed the standard approaches of the Cochrane review process and believe that no specific biases apply to this review other than those already discussed. However, we changed the grading of quality of surgical field from "good, fair, poor" in the protocol to 6-point scale surgical field in the review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two systematic reviews were published in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-DeConde-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeConde 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2013</LINK>), however they were not concerned with the effect of the deliberate hypotensive technique.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-DeConde-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeConde 2013</LINK> compared total intravenous anaesthesia with inhalation anaesthesia for FESS. They included seven studies, and reported lower blood loss and better surgical field quality during operation, however many of the participants did not receive deliberate hypotensive technique. DeConde et al, reported that evidence to support total intravenous anaesthesia was limited to a handful of inconsistently controlled and reported studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2013</LINK> reviewed the evidence for the effect of total intravenous anaesthesia compared to inhalational anaesthesia on quality of the surgical field during FESS in adults. Kelly et al, included seven studies in their review (<LINK REF="STD-Ahn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ahn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankichetty-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ankichetty 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beule-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Beule 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tirelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tirelli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wormald-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wormald 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yoo 2010</LINK>), three of which we included in this current review (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tirelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tirelli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wormald-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wormald 2005</LINK>). Kelly et al, reported that they were unable to reach a firm conclusion on the effect of total intravenous anaesthesia on surgical field grading, despite several of the included studies reporting a benefit.</P>
<P>Two published narrative reviews compared surgical field and blood loss during FESS (<LINK REF="REF-Amorocho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amorocho 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Amorocho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amorocho 2010</LINK> compared propofol general anaesthesia and inhalation anaesthesia. They concluded that propofol general anaesthesia improved the surgical field and reduced blood loss over inhalation anaesthesia. <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2010</LINK> compared propofol general anaesthesia and inhalation anaesthesia and concluded that propofol general anaesthesia improved the surgical field but did not reduce blood loss during FESS.</P>
<P>All four reviews included both normotensive and deliberate hypotensive techniques in their review, and so cannot be directly compared with this review; however, their outcomes did not in general conflict with our findings.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:38:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found insufficient evidence to determine the effects of deliberate hypotension with propofol compared to inhalational agents for FESS surgery. We identified few existing studies, and those we did find were underpowered to show clinically important differences. However, the evidence suggests there may be advantages in both total measured blood loss and the quality of the surgical field with the use of propofol. This review is unlikely to change current practice, and experienced anaesthetists are unlikely to alter their preferred technique on the basis of these findings.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-30 14:38:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality evidence is required to examine the effect of deliberate hypotension with propofol versus other techniques on surgical field quality, total blood loss, and complications. Larger studies with allocation concealment and blinding are needed to be able to draw any firm conclusions. Standard grading of surgical field quality and a reliability study should be done, and a similar approach taken to compare the total measured blood loss. Comparison studies of propofol with other antihypertensive drugs (vasodilators, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and opioids) for deliberate hypotension during general anaesthesia are required. The effect of opioids on blood loss during deliberate hypotension should be explored.</P>
