<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:20:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Can dietary advice for pregnant women prevent the development of diabetes in pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can cause health complications for women and their babies?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure and protein in their urine during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), and of having a caesarean section birth. Their babies may grow large and, as a result, be injured at birth, or cause injury to their mothers during birth. Additionally, there can be long-term health problems for women and their babies, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. The number of women being diagnosed with GDM is increasing around the world, so finding simple and cost-effective ways to prevent women developing GDM is important.</P>
<P>Carbohydrates are the main nutrient affecting blood glucose after meals. The glycaemic index (GI) can be used to characterise the capability of carbohydrate-based foods to raise these levels. Some diets, for example, those with low-fibre and high-GI foods, can increase the risk of developing GDM. It has been suggested that dietary advice interventions in pregnancy may help to prevent women developing GDM.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies on 3 January 2016, and included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2786 pregnant women and their babies. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low and the overall risk of bias of the trials was unclear to moderate. Six trials compared dietary advice with standard care, four compared advice focused on a low-GI diet with advice for a moderate- to high-GI diet, and one compared dietary advice focused on a high-fibre diet with standard advice.</P>
<P>There was a possible reduction in the development of GDM for women who received dietary advice versus standard care across five trials (1279 women, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), though no clear difference for GDM was seen between women who received low- versus moderate- to high-GI diet advice across four trials (912 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Two trials (282 women) reported no clear difference between women who received dietary advice versus standard care for pre-eclampsia (<I>low-quality evidence</I>), though fewer women who received dietary advice developed pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no clear difference between the groups of women who received low-GI and moderate- to high-GI diet advice, in the number of babies born large-for-gestational age across three trials (777 babies, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Only one trial comparing dietary advice with standard care reported on the number of babies who died (either before birth or shortly afterwards), with no deaths in this trial.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences for most of the other outcomes assessed in the trials comparing dietary advice with standard care. including caesarean section, perineal trauma, and child skin-fold thickness at six months. However, women who received dietary advice gained less weight during their pregnancy across five trials (1336 women) (<I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Similarly, there were no clear differences for other outcomes assessed in the trials comparing low- and moderate- to high-GI diet advice, including for caesarean birth and weight gain in pregnancy. The trial comparing dietary advice focused on a high-fibre diet with standard advice found no clear differences for any outcomes.</P>
<P>The included trials did not report on a large number of outcomes listed in this review, including outcomes relating to longer-term health for the women and their babies (as children and adults), and the use and cost of health services.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Dietary advice interventions for pregnant women may be able to prevent GDM. Based on current trials, however, conclusive evidence is not yet available to guide practice. Further large, well-designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effects of dietary interventions in pregnancy for preventing GDM and improving other health outcomes for mothers and their babies in the short and long term. Five trials are ongoing, and four await classification (pending availability of more information) and will be considered in the next update of this review.</P>

<P>We included 11 trials involving 2786 women and their babies, with an overall unclear to moderate risk of bias. Six trials compared dietary advice interventions with standard care; four compared low glycaemic index (GI) with moderate- to high-GI dietary advice; one compared specific (high-fibre focused) with standard dietary advice.</P>

<B>Dietary advice interventions versus standard care (six trials)</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Considering primary outcomes, a trend towards a reduction in GDM was observed for women receiving dietary advice compared with standard care (average risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.04; five trials, 1279 women; Tau = 0.20; I = 56%; P = 0.07; GRADE: <I>very low-quality evidence</I>); subgroup analysis suggested a greater treatment effect for overweight and obese women receiving dietary advice. While no clear difference was observed for pre-eclampsia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.46; two trials, 282 women; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>) a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension was observed for women receiving dietary advice (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; two trials, 282 women; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>). One trial reported on perinatal mortality, and no deaths were observed (GRADE: <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). None of the trials reported on large-for-gestational age or neonatal mortality and morbidity.</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, no clear differences were seen for caesarean section (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.24; four trials, 1194 women; Tau = 0.02; I = 36%; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or perineal trauma (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.08; one trial, 759 women; GRADE: <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Women who received dietary advice gained less weight during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) -4.70 kg, 95% CI -8.07 to -1.34; five trials, 1336 women; Tau = 13.64; I = 96%; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>); the result should be interpreted with some caution due to considerable heterogeneity. No clear differences were seen for the majority of secondary outcomes reported, including childhood/adulthood adiposity (skin-fold thickness at six months) (MD -0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.51; one trial, 132 children; GRADE: <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Women receiving dietary advice had a lower well-being score between 14 and 28 weeks, more weight loss at three months, and were less likely to have glucose intolerance (one trial).</P>
<P>The trials did not report on other secondary outcomes, particularly those related to long-term health and health service use and costs.

<P>No clear differences were shown for caesarean birth (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.04; two trials, 201 women; GRADE: <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) and gestational weight gain (MD -1.23 kg, 95% CI -4.08 to 1.61; four trials, 787 women; Tau = 7.31; I = 90%; GRADE: <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), or for other reported secondary outcomes.</P>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:19:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Very low-quality evidence from five trials suggests a possible reduction in GDM risk for women receiving dietary advice versus standard care, and low-quality evidence from four trials suggests no clear difference for women receiving low- versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice. A possible reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension for women receiving dietary advice was observed and no clear differences were seen for other reported primary outcomes. There were few outcome data for secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>For outcomes assessed using GRADE, evidence was considered to be low to very low quality, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and inconsistency.</P>
<P>More high-quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of dietary advice interventions in pregnancy. Future trials should be designed to monitor adherence, women's views and preferences, and powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term outcomes; there is a need for such trials to collect and report on core outcomes for GDM research. We have identified five ongoing studies and four are awaiting classification. We will consider these in the next review update.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gestational diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance or hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose concentration) that begins or is first detected during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). In pregnancy, placental hormones (including oestrogen, progesterone, cortisol, placental lactogen, prolactin and growth hormone), create an insulin-resistant state in order to direct sufficient nutrition to the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Setji-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setji 2005</LINK>). For women with GDM, increased insulin resistance accompanied by an insufficient compensatory insulin release limits glucose transport into cells, resulting in maternal hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Setji-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setji 2005</LINK>). This in turn can result in fetal hyperglycaemia, which stimulates insulin production, thus allowing increased glucose and amino acid entry into cells, increasing metabolism and, ultimately, over-nourishing the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Setji-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setji 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of risk factors for the development of GDM have been identified. These include non-modifiable risk factors, such as ethnicity (e.g. African, Hispanic, South or East Asian, Native American and Pacific Islander), advanced maternal age, maternal high or low birthweight, high parity (<LINK REF="REF-Petry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petry 2010</LINK>), polycystic ovarian syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Toulis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toulis 2009</LINK>), a past history of a macrosomic (large) baby or a stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Petry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petry 2010</LINK>), a past history of GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2007</LINK>), and family history of first-degree relatives with GDM or type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Petry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petry 2010</LINK>). Risk factors considered modifiable include maternal overweight or obesity (body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25 kg/m or 30 kg/m, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Morisset-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morisset 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torloni-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torloni 2009</LINK>), certain dietary factors (<LINK REF="REF-Morisset-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morisset 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK>; <I>discussed further below</I>), physical inactivity before or in early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Tobias-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobias 2011</LINK>), and weight gain during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Morisset-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morisset 2010</LINK>), including for those women who are overweight or obese.</P>
<P>Selective (risk factor) or universal screening for GDM is usually performed between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation, with the use of a 50 g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT). Diagnosis is then made following a 75 g two-hour or 100 g three-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Alternatively, a diagnostic OGTT may be used without prior OGCT. Diagnostic criteria for GDM have changed over time, and vary nationally and internationally (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IADPSG-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IADPSG 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nankervis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankervis 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-New-Zealand-Ministry-of-Health-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">New Zealand Ministry of Health 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Accordingly, GDM prevalence estimates vary depending on both the diagnostic criteria used, and the population(s) assessed; for example, a recent study identified GDM prevalence estimates to range from less than 1% to 28% (with data derived from expert estimates, single/multi-site and national prevalence assessments across 30 countries) (<LINK REF="REF-Jiwani-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiwani 2012</LINK>). Despite variation in diagnostic criteria, there is widespread agreement that the prevalence of diabetes, including GDM, is increasing across the world, in line with the escalating prevalence of obesity. A recent estimate of the global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (including GDM and 'total diabetes' (known/unknown pre-existing diabetes) was 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Guariguata-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guariguata 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>GDM is associated with adverse consequences for women and their babies, in the short and long term. Babies of women with GDM are more likely to be macrosomic (with a birthweight exceeding 4000 g or 4500 g), or be born large for their gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Reece-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>). These babies are thus at an increased risk of injury at the time of birth, including birth asphyxia, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture or nerve palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Reece-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>). Additional risks for babies in the short term include respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and polycythaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Reece-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>); such health consequences together contribute to an increased risk of admission to the neonatal nursery, and perinatal mortality. There is increasing evidence to suggest that infants born to women with GDM are at risk of being obese in childhood or adulthood, and at increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes later in life (<LINK REF="REF-Reece-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>). Women with GDM are at additional risk in the short term of developing pre-eclampsia, having a caesarean section birth (including due to their babies being large-for-gestational age) and perineal trauma; in the longer term, women are at increased risk of developing GDM in a subsequent pregnancy, and of developing later cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Reece-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dietary advice in pregnancy for preventing gestational diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Dietary interventions in pregnancy to prevent GDM may incorporate varied advice, based on addressing potential risk factors, with the aim of preventing maternal hyperglycaemia. Dietary interventions to treat pregnancy hyperglycaemia have a similar aim of optimising glycaemic control, and thus improving outcomes for women and their babies, and are widely used as a primary management strategy. Three Cochrane reviews have assessed such interventions (incorporating dietary advice), in pregnancy for the treatment of hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012b</LINK>) or GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>), and have showed some benefits. <LINK REF="REF-Han-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012b</LINK> included four trials (involving 543 women and their babies) assessing dietary advice and blood glucose concentration monitoring for women with pregnancy hyperglycaemia not meeting GDM and type 2 diagnostic criteria. The review revealed a reduced risk of babies being born large-for-gestational age and macrosomic with such interventions; however <LINK REF="REF-Han-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012b</LINK> highlighted that the results were based on small, low-quality randomised trials and thus recognised a need for further research (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012b</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK> included eight randomised trials (involving 1418 women and their babies) assessing a range of interventions for treating GDM, with five incorporating dietary advice. This review revealed that these interventions, incorporating dietary advice (and insulin therapy, where indicated), reduced the risk of adverse consequences for women and their babies (including pre-eclampsia, a composite outcome of perinatal death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture and nerve palsy, macrosomia and large-for-gestational age), and concluded that further research should focus on the impact of different types of intensive treatment on short- and long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK> was specifically conducted to assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM, and identified nine randomised trials (involving 437 women and their babies). These trials compared dietary advice focused on: low- to moderate-GI food versus high- to moderate-GI food; low-GI diet versus high-fibre moderate-GI diet; energy-restricted diet versus no energy restriction diet; low-carbohydrate diet versus high-carbohydrate diet; high-monounsaturated fat diet versus high-carbohydrate diet; and standard-fibre diet versus fibre-enriched diet. The types of dietary advice that are most effective for women with GDM remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two further Cochrane reviews have assessed the effects of dietary advice interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Nield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2008</LINK>), and combined dietary advice and exercise advice interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Orozco-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orozco 2008</LINK>) for preventing type 2 diabetes in adults. <LINK REF="REF-Nield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2008</LINK> included two randomised trials involving 328 people. A 33% reduction (P &lt; 0.03) in the incidence of diabetes with dietary advice in one trial at six-year follow-up and beneficial effects on markers of metabolic control (reductions in insulin resistance, fasting insulin and blood glucose) in the other included trial at one-year follow-up were shown. <LINK REF="REF-Nield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2008</LINK> recognised that <I>"more well-designed, long-term studies, providing well-reported, high-quality data are required before proper conclusions can be made into the best dietary advice for the prevention of diabetes mellitus in adults" </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Nield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2008</LINK>). The Nield 2008 review has been withdrawn as it will be superseded by a new review, with broader scope, focused on &#8216;Diet, physical activity or both for the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk' (<LINK REF="REF-Nield-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Orozco-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orozco 2008</LINK> included eight trials (involving 5956 people) assessing exercise plus diet interventions for prevention of type 2 diabetes, and overall showed a reduction in the risk of diabetes with such interventions (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.79). The authors of the review concluded benefit for the high-risk groups assessed (people with impaired glucose tolerance or the metabolic syndrome), and highlighted a need for further research assessing impact on other outcomes including quality of life, morbidity and mortality, with a special focus on cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Orozco-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orozco 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the benefits of dietary advice intervention have been observed in randomised trials and systematic reviews for women with GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK>), in relation to improved outcomes for women and their babies, and for adults at risk of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Nield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orozco-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orozco 2008</LINK>), in regards to prevention of diabetes development, to date, the effects of such interventions for pregnant women for the prevention of GDM are unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dietary advice in pregnancy for preventing gestational diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>A large and increasing number of observational studies have suggested various components of women's diets or dietary patterns before and during pregnancy which may influence GDM risk (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK>). Some of the most recent published evidence relates to the Nurses' Health Study II, a longitudinal cohort of 116,000 nurses between the ages of 25 and 42 in the USA followed since 1989. Studies from this cohort indicate that pre-pregnancy, higher consumption of sugar-sweetened cola (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>); frequent fried food consumption, particularly away from home (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2014</LINK>); higher levels of potato consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2016</LINK>); higher intakes of animal fat and dietary cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Bowers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowers 2012</LINK>); a high-glycaemic load and low-cereal fibre diet (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006b</LINK>); higher intake of dietary heme iron (<LINK REF="REF-Bowers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowers 2011</LINK>); higher intake of animal protein, in particular red and processed meat (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>); and a low-carbohydrate dietary pattern with high protein and fat from animal-food sources (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2014b</LINK>) are associated with a higher risk of GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2013</LINK>). Conversely, pre-pregnancy, a high-fibre diet (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006b</LINK>); higher intake of vegetable protein (specifically nuts); the substitution of red meat with poultry, fish, nuts or legumes (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2013</LINK>); the substitution of potatoes with other vegetables, legumes or whole grain foods (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2016</LINK>); and adherence to <I>"healthful" </I>dietary patterns (alternate Mediterranean (aMED), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and the alternate Healthy Eating Index (aHEI) dietary patterns) (<LINK REF="REF-Tobias-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobias 2012</LINK>) are associated with a lower risk of GDM.</P>
<P>Additional observational studies have shown numerous, and often similar, findings; with high egg and cholesterol intakes before and during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2011b</LINK>); high levels of dietary heme iron intake before and during early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2011</LINK>); a 'Meats, snacks and sweets' dietary pattern before pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Schoenaker-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoenaker 2015</LINK>); lower carbohydrate and higher total fat intakes as a percentage of energy in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Ley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 2011</LINK>); and high consumption of refined grains, fat, added sugars and low intake of fruits and vegetables during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Shin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 2015</LINK>) shown to be associated with a higher risk of GDM. A 'Mediterranean-style' dietary pattern before pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Schoenaker-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoenaker 2015</LINK>); a healthy <I>"prudent"</I> dietary pattern (with high intakes of seafood, eggs, vegetables, fruits and berries, vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, pasta, breakfast cereals; and low intakes of soft drinks and French fries) during pregnancy especially among women who were overweight or obese (<LINK REF="REF-Tryggvadottir-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tryggvadottir 2016</LINK>); and improved quality of dietary fat incorporating increased n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Barbieiri-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbieiri 2015</LINK>) have been associated with a lower risk of GDM.</P>
<P>Thus, as a number of dietary components/patterns have been shown to influence GDM risk, specific dietary advice interventions aimed at preventing GDM may be varied, and as such, may influence maternal glycaemic control through multiple mechanisms.</P>
<P>Advice can focus on both the quantity and type of carbohydrates consumed, with carbohydrates being the main nutrient affecting post-prandial glucose concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Reader-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reader 2007</LINK>). Dietary GI can be used to characterise the capability of carbohydrate-based foods to induce post-prandial glycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1981</LINK>); foods with a low GI (such as whole-grain foods and many fruits and vegetables) produce a lower post-prandial glucose elevation, while foods with a high GI (highly processed foods such as white bread and some breakfast cereals) produce a rapid increase in post-prandial blood glucose concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1981</LINK>). Dietary fibre may influence glucose homeostasis through a number of mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006b</LINK>). For example, a high-fibre diet may reduce appetite and lower total energy intake, thus reducing adiposity and improving insulin sensitivity, or increased fibre may delay gastric emptying and slow digestion, subsequently reducing glucose absorption and insulin secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006b</LINK>). Red and processed meat intake is postulated to influence glycaemic control through a variety of pathways (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>), including through the adverse effects of components including saturated fat and cholesterol, and nitrites, used as a preservative agent, influencing insulin sensitivity and/or pancreatic beta-cell function, or through the toxic effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can be formed in meat following heating and processing (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>). Restricting calorie intake could also influence glycaemic status and insulin sensitivity, through promoting weight loss and reduced fat mass (<LINK REF="REF-Knopp-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knopp 1991</LINK>). Excessive calorie restriction can however lead to ketonuria and ketonaemia through ketosis by accelerated fat catabolism, which has been associated with adverse psychomotor development for the child (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzo 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we evaluated the quality of the evidence for two of our three comparisons using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A>. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for specific outcomes. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or publication bias. In this review we planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the primary outcomes, as follows. We used the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth GRADE core outcome set for reviews of prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy.</P>

Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source.

If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both types of studies if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<P>Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary has been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results have been presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Although all six trials compared dietary advice with standard care, a range of specific dietary interventions were assessed. In general, women were counselled with regards to common healthy eating strategies, though resources used and protocols followed by each trial varied.</P>
<P>Women in the dietary advice intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> received a total of 10, one-hour consultations with a dietitian. Advice was based on Danish dietary recommendations (fat intake: max 30 energy percent (E%), protein intake: 15 to 20 E%, carbohydrate intake: 50 to 55 E%), and individualised intake restrictions were based on each woman's energy requirements and the estimated energetic cost of fetal growth.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>, women in the dietary advice intervention group received counselling by a dietitian at each study visit, which occurred three times during pregnancy (mean of 13, 24 and 34 weeks' gestation) and at one, six and 12 months postpartum, which aimed to modify dietary intake to confirm with Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (with a particular focus on quality of dietary fat: saturated fatty acids providing 10% or less of energy intake, monounsaturated 10% to 15% and polyunsaturated fatty acids 5% to 10%). Women in the dietary advice intervention group were also provided with food products of favourable fat composition and fibre contents.</P>
<P>Women in the dietary advice intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK> attended a two-hour group dietary session (mean: 15.7 weeks' gestation) in groups of two to six with a research dietitian, where women received advice on general healthy eating guidelines for pregnancy; with women encouraged to choose as many low-GI foods as possible, but not to reduce their total caloric intake. Women then received two further dietary intervention sessions with the research dietitian at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation who reinforced the low-GI diet, and answered any questions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK> used Australian guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council for healthy eating as the basis of the dietary advice intervention which utilised a &#8216;four-step multidisciplinary approach.&#8217; For women in the dietary advice intervention group, this approach, at a study-specific antenatal clinic, included 1) continuity of care by a single maternity provider; 2) assessment of weight gain at each antenatal visit; 3) a brief intervention (five minutes) by a food technologist before each visit; 4) an assessment by a clinical psychologist with intervention if required.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>, women in the dietary advice intervention group were 'nutritionally monitored'. They were prescribed a nutritionally balanced diet based on their weight at study entry and were asked to record all food and drink consumed each day in a food diary and these records were reviewed at each antenatal visit by the physician. Women in both groups were counselled at least once by a dietitian regarding conventional nutrition guidelines, however the intervention group received more detailed intake advice (recommendations: 18 to 24 kcal/kg (at least 2000 calories) consisting of 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 30% fat).</P>
<P>Women in the dietary advice intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK> received dietary counselling according to their baseline nutritional status (assessed to be low weight, eutrophic or overweight), at an initial session, with reinforcement once a month thereafter. Advice in this trial aimed to improve the quality of food consumed in addition to augmenting the speed of weight gain during pregnancy.</P>
<P>The control groups in the trials received standard care without additional dietary advice at the hospital/clinic they attended (<LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK> <I>"All women attended communal dietary counselling provided by welfare clinics according to a national program, which consists of information of dietary guidelines through conversations and written material mediated by educated nurses;" </I>and in <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>, all women in the standard care group were counselled at least once by a registered dietitian regarding conventional nutrition guidelines. Three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>) asked women in both dietary advice intervention and standard care groups to provide information on their dietary intake through food diaries/records including at baseline, and in the second and/or third trimesters.</P>
<P>Both dietary advice intervention and standard care groups in <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> were given supplements to ensure adequate vitamin and trace element intake, particularly iron and folic acid.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK> also assessed the effects of probiotics, necessitating a third study group, not included in this review, who received dietary counselling in addition to a probiotic. Women in both the dietary advice and standard care groups of <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>, included in this review, received placebo capsules (containing microcrystalline cellulose and dextrose anhydrate), from their first study visit until the end of exclusive breastfeeding.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">GDM diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used, and the diagnosis of GDM was based on modified criteria of the Fourth International Workshop Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. Specifically, GDM was diagnosed when one plasma glucose concentration exceeded &#8805; 4.8 mmol/L at baseline, &#8805; 10.0 mmol/L at one hour or &#8805; 8.7 mmol/L at two hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK> similarly used a 75 g OGTT, with the diagnosis of GDM based on World Health Organization Criteria; specifically, GDM was diagnosed when the two-hour plasma glucose concentration was &gt; 7.7 mmol/L.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>, a 50 g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) was used at 28 weeks' gestation, and women with a one-hour blood glucose concentration &#8805; 8.3 mmol/L underwent an OGTT; GDM was diagnosed if two or more abnormal results were observed during a three-hour, 100 g OGTT diagnosed according to the Carpenter and Coustan criteria (fasting &#8805; 5.3 mmol/L, one-hour &#8805; 10.0 mmol/L, two-hour &#8805; 8.6 mmol/L, three-hour &#8805; 7.8 mmol/L). <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK> reported GDM diagnosed according American Diabetes Association criteria (GDM diagnosed when any one of the following plasma glucose concentrations were exceeded: fasting &#8805; 5.1 mmol/L, one-hour &#8805; 10.0 mmol/L, two-hour &#8805; 8.5 mmol/L).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> reported that <I>"Fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 h postprandial to an oral glucose tolerance test of a 50-g glucose load were analyzed"</I>, however did not report specific criteria for GDM diagnosis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Women in <LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK> were randomised at eight weeks' gestation, to either a high-GI/cafeteria diet (with carbohydrates from highly processed grains, root vegetables, and simple sugars) or a low-GI/Aboriginal diet (with carbohydrates from unprocessed whole grains, fruits, beans and vegetables, and dairy products).</P>
<P>Women in both groups of <LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK> were recommended diets with a composition of 17% to 19% protein, 20% to 25% fat and 55% to 60% carbohydrate, with a total intake of 35 to 45 kcal/kg of lean body mass. Adherence was assessed by random, twice weekly 24-hour dietary recalls by a dietitian.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK>, women in the low-GI dietary advice group had a target GI of 50 or less, while those in the high-fibre, moderate-GI dietary advice group had a target GI of 60; though all women were recommended a similar macronutrient composition, of 15% to 25% protein, 25% to 39% fat, and 40% to 45% carbohydrate. All women attended a total of five individual dietary consultations with a dietitian (at 14 to 20, 18 to 24, 22 to 28, 26 to 32, and 34 to 36 weeks' gestation); with visit one using a three-day food record as the basis of dietary counselling, and written information regarding low-GI/high-fibre foods and pregnancy nutrition provided; and visits two to four using four-stage multiple-pass 24-hour recalls, and suitable alternative foods encouraged for non-compliant women. All women in <LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK> were also provided with food samples (supplementary baskets) containing key foods for their assigned diet at all five consultations.</P>
<P>Women in both groups of <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK> were also seen by a dietitian five times during their pregnancy (who was also available for telephone queries outside of scheduled visits); at visit one, a three-day food record and diet history was taken; at visit two (a week later), women received dietary education for either a low-GI diet (verified low-GI foods including pasta, brand-name breads and breakfast cereals with high-fibre content) or a moderate- to high-GI diet (high fibre, low sugar foods including potatoes, wheat-meal bread, and specific high-fibre breakfast cereals with moderate- to high-GI); at visits three (22 weeks' gestation) and four (30 weeks' gestation), 24-hour diet recalls were taken, and at visit five (36 weeks) a further three day food record and diet history were taken. All women in <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK> were advised to maintain a diet of 33% fat and 55% carbohydrate (with only the recommended choice of carbohydrate foods varying), were provided with a booklet that outlined the carbohydrate choices and the food amounts that constituted one serving, and were provided key foods in a monthly hamper.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>, all women received a set of booklets; for women in the low-GI dietary advice group, counselling focused on choices for and serving sizes of carbohydrate-rich foods, with specific information provided on low-GI alternatives for relevant food groups; while for women in the healthy eating dietary advice group, counselling focused on a conventional healthy diet with recommended foods and serving sizes as noted in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and no specific guidance on GI was given. There was no intended difference between groups in the macronutrient distribution of the diet, and for all women in <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK> there were four contact points; at the first, a three-day food record was reviewed, and diet education was given specific to the assigned group by the dietitian; at the second, a phone call was made (four weeks after the first visit), to ensure adherence to the diet and goals set and identify any barriers or concerns; at the third, a dietitian reviewed the women face-to-face (at 28 weeks) before their obstetric appointment to monitor progress; at the fourth (as late as possible, and at a minimum of 34 weeks' gestation), the dietitian collected and reviewed the final three-day food records. For all women in <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>, the research dietitian was available for telephone queries outside of scheduled visits, and an email with nutrition tips and recipes was sent monthly (five in total) to all women with content dependent on group.</P>

<P>For Comparison 1: Dietary advice interventions versus standard care, we conducted a subgroup analysis for our primary outcome, GDM, based on BMI at trial entry. The test for subgroup differences was significant (Chi = 4.57, P = 0.03, I = 78.1%), indicating a possible difference in treatment effect based on BMI (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In particular, this subgroup analysis suggested a greater treatment effect (reduction in GDM risk for women who received dietary advice interventions) among trials that recruited overweight and/or obese women (BMI &gt; 25). We were not able to perform subgroup analyses based on BMI at trial entry for the other primary outcomes in this comparison, with only two trials (both recruiting overweight/obese women) reporting on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and only one trial reporting on perinatal mortality.</P>
<P>We were not able to perform the other pre-specified subgroup analyses in this version of the review, due to the paucity of data across the three comparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>For Comparison 1: Dietary advice interventions versus standard care, we conducted sensitivity analyses for our primary outcomes with reported data, exploring the effects of trial quality assessed by sequence generation and allocation concealment by omitting studies rated as 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear risk of bias' for these components. As <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> was the only trial to have an 'unclear risk of bias' rating for allocation concealment, this was the only trial excluded from the GDM meta-analysis. Excluding this trial from the meta-analysis did not greatly impact the overall effect observed for this outcome (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10; four trials, 1266 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). When we excluded data from <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> from the meta-analysis for pregnancy-induced hypertension, only data from <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK> remained, which showed no clear difference between groups (different to in the main analysis) (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.06; one trial, 232 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Similarly, when data from <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK> were excluded from the meta-analysis for pre-eclampsia, only data from <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK> remained, with no clear difference between groups (as in the main analysis) (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.58; one trial, 232 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK> reported on perinatal mortality (with no deaths observed in this trial) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), and thus no sensitivity analysis was performed for this outcome.</P>
<P>For Comparison 2: Low-GI dietary advice versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice, we planned to conduct sensitivity analyses for our primary outcomes with reported data (GDM and large-for-gestational age). However, as all of the four trials contributing data to these meta-analyses had an 'unclear risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' for at least one of the two domains (sequence generation or allocation concealment), we did not perform these analyses.</P>
<P>No sensitivity analyses were performed for Comparison 3: High-fibre dietary advice versus standard dietary advice, given that only one trial was included (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1983</LINK>), and this trial did not report on the primary outcomes.</P>

<P>Eleven trials (involving 2786 women and their babies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Six trials compared dietary advice interventions with standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>); four compared low glycaemic index (GI) with moderate- to high-GI dietary advice interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>); and one compared specific (high-fibre focused) with standard dietary advice (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of trials comparing dietary advice interventions with standard care demonstrated a trend towards a reduction in the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (8.60% versus 12.60%, in five trials) (P = 0.07). The subgroup analysis based on body mass index (BMI) at trial entry, suggested a possible differential treatment effect for this outcome based on trial entry BMI, with a greater effect on GDM incidence observed in overweight and/or obese women receiving dietary advice. No clear differences were observed for the other reported primary outcomes pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality; these findings remained unchanged in the sensitivity analyses involving trials with a low risk of bias in the domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Similarly, we found no clear differences in these trials for the majority of reported secondary outcomes for the mother and the child. In these trials, reductions in pregnancy-induced hypertension (2.88% versus 9.79%, across two trials) and gestational weight gain (on average 4.70 kg less, across five trials) were observed, along with greater weight loss at three months postpartum (on average 1.43 kg more, in one trial) for women who received the dietary advice interventions. Well-being (assessed using the WHO well-being index) at 14 to 28 weeks' gestation, was found to be lower in the dietary intervention group (a percentage score 3.60 lower, in one trial). Diet-related behaviour changes were mixed at three months postpartum (one trial). Over-interpretation of these findings is cautioned in view of the small sample sizes and limited high-quality evidence.</P>
<P>In the trials comparing low-GI with moderate- to high-GI dietary advice interventions, no clear differences were seen for the reported primary outcomes: GDM and large-for-gestational age; or for the majority of reported secondary outcomes for the mother and the child. While no difference was shown for fasting glucose at 24 to 28 weeks (one trial), women receiving low-GI dietary advice had a marginally lower fasting blood glucose at 32 to 36 weeks (0.27 mmol/L lower, in two trials).</P>
<P>In the trial comparing high-fibre dietary advice with standard dietary advice, no clear differences were seen for the two reported secondary outcomes: blood glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 35 weeks; and birthweight centile.</P>

<P>The trials in this review were conducted with healthy women and those considered at high risk of developing GDM, including overweight/obese women. These trials recruited pregnant women from hospitals in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>), the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>), Brazil (<LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK>), Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>), Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>), Ireland (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>), and the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1983</LINK>); and thus, the results may not be applicable to all settings or countries worldwide.</P>
<P>Four of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>) included 73 women or fewer, five trials included 315 women or fewer (<LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK>). The two largest trials were in 691 and 800 women (<LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>). Thus, largely the included trials were far too small to show differences in important but rare outcomes, such as perinatal mortality, and even in more common outcomes, such as GDM.</P>
<P>Though there were a total of 2786 women and their babies across the included trials, for the majority of outcomes, only one or two trials reported data, further limiting the statistical power of the meta-analyses and the precision of the estimates of treatment effects. Lack of uniformity in reporting outcomes including diagnostic criteria limits the interpretation of data. Many important outcomes for women and their babies were not reported across the comparisons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The six trials assessing dietary advice interventions versus standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>), did not report on the primary outcomes included in this review: large-for-gestational age and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite; and the trials did not report on a number of secondary outcomes, particularly long-term outcomes for the mother and child, and health services outcomes.</LI>
<LI>The four trials comparing low-GI dietary advice with moderate- to high-GI dietary advice (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>), did not report on the primary outcomes of this review: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite; and similarly did not report the majority of secondary outcomes, including long-term outcomes for the mother and child, and health services outcomes.</LI>
<LI>The one trial comparing high-fibre dietary advice with "standard advice" (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1983</LINK>) did not report on any primary outcomes, and reported on only two secondary outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This may reflect multiple factors influencing outcome data collection and reporting, including evolving recognition of important outcome measures and changes in diagnostic parameters, particularly affecting older trials, the selective reporting of outcome data by trials where no differences were observed, or limitations at manuscript publication. The limited data regarding longer-term health of women and their children reported to date from the included trials, could reflect a 'lag' time between recognition by trialists of the importance of such outcomes, and the subsequent collection and reporting of these outcome data (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2016</LINK>). While long-term follow-up of trials assessing perinatal interventions is widely regarded as important, it has been recognised that only a minority of trials are able to do so; often due to the time-consuming and expensive nature of follow-up, commonly falling outside of the funding period, or interest of the trialists (<LINK REF="REF-Teune-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teune 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the often 'negative' results from included trials to date may reflect lack of statistical power, the absence of observed clear differences could also be partially attributable to lack of intervention uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 2014</LINK>). The efficacy of dietary intervention is likely to be influenced by many factors, including background dietary habits and barriers such as affordability, satisfaction with changes and convenience. It is noteworthy that in one small trial, low-GI diet was associated with a poorer sense of well-being, which is likely to influence intervention adherence. In the included trials, information regarding adherence, but particularly women's views, has to date been limited. As noted by <LINK REF="REF-Halperin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 2014</LINK> in a recent narrative review of the role of lifestyle interventions for GDM prevention, in addition to being powered to detect reductions in GDM, future trials should be designed to monitor lifestyle changes closely, and may include a psychological component as part of the intervention, such as in <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>Earlier trials, such as <LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK> compared low-GI with high or moderate- to high-GI dietary advice, including to test the hypothesis that a woman's dietary carbohydrate mix modifies glucose and insulin responses (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 1998</LINK>). In recognition that current best practice for GDM prevention, and indeed management, focuses on optimising glycaemic control, it is unlikely that further trials specifically assessing high-GI diets will be conducted. More recent trials, such as <LINK REF="STD-Markovic-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Markovic 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2014</LINK>, have instead focused on comparisons of low-GI specific dietary advice with 'standard' healthy eating advice (including for a moderate-GI diet), or on comparing more general 'healthy eating' advice (including in combination with a multi-disciplinary approach (<LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>), or with an additional focus on low-GI foods (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>)) with standard care.</P>

<P>Overall, the 11 included trials were judged to be at unclear to moderate risk of bias. Often there was insufficient information provided to enable a judgement of risk, particularly with regard to sequence generation and allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Only four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2012</LINK>) were considered to be at low risk of selection bias (with methods considered to be adequate for both sequence generation and allocation concealment); where possible, these trials were included in sensitivity analyses for primary outcomes in the first comparison.</P>
<P>We used GRADE profiler to assess the quality of the evidence for the two comparisons 'Dietary advice interventions versus standard care', <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, and 'Low-GI dietary advice versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice' <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. Several maternal and child outcomes were assessed for their quality of evidence.</P>
<P>For the first comparison, the evidence was of low quality (assessed using the GRADE system) for the following outcomes: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia; pregnancy-induced hypertension), caesarean section, gestational weight gain, and childhood adult adiposity (skin-fold thickness at six months). The evidence for the outcomes: GDM, perineal trauma and perinatal mortality was very low quality.</P>
<P>For the second comparison, the evidence for GDM was assessed of being low quality, while the evidence for the outcomes: caesarean section, gestational weight gain, and large-for-gestational age, was assessed as being very low quality.</P>
<P>Evidence downgrading was based on study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision (largely the presence of wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect), and inconsistency.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:39:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two Cochrane systematic reviews have assessed exercise alone (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012</LINK>) and combined diet and exercise interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK>) for preventing GDM. In <LINK REF="REF-Han-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012</LINK>, five randomised trials (involving 1115 women and their babies) assessing exercise interventions were included. <LINK REF="REF-Han-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012</LINK> found no clear difference between women who received exercise interventions during pregnancy and those who received standard care for the risk of GDM, nor for any of the other primary or secondary outcomes for women and their babies reported by the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK> included 13 randomised trials (involving 4983 women and their babies) assessing combined diet and exercise interventions. In this review no clear difference between groups was shown for the risk of GDM, nor for the majority of other primary and secondary outcomes reported by the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK>). The review did show a possible reduction in preterm birth for women receiving diet and exercise interventions (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.93; five trials, 2713 infants) (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK>) (a difference not observed in this review), however the review authors suggested caution in interpretation of these results due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the trials combined in the meta-analysis. In <LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK>, similar to our review, a possible benefit in relation to less weight gain during pregnancy was observed for women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions. On average, women receiving diet and exercise interventions gained 0.76 kg less than women in the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.76 kg, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.03; eight trials, 2707 women) (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK>). These reviews have largely been limited by quality of evidence, heterogeneity in trial methodologies and outcome reporting, similar to this review.</P>
<P>An additional Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Muktabhant-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muktabhant 2015</LINK>) has assessed diet or exercise, or both, interventions for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, and associated complications. This review included 65 randomised trials (49 involving 11,444 women with data in the meta-analyses) (<LINK REF="REF-Muktabhant-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muktabhant 2015</LINK>). Similar to in our review, a benefit in relation to less weight gain during pregnancy was observed - women receiving diet or exercise, or both interventions (including interventions involving low glycaemic load diets, supervised or unsupervised exercise only, or diet and exercise combined) were less likely to gain excessive gestational weight gain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.87; 24 trials, 7096 women) (<LINK REF="REF-Muktabhant-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muktabhant 2015</LINK>). Also similar to our review, while no clear difference was seen in the risk of pre-eclampsia, a possible reduction in maternal hypertension was observed for women receiving diet or exercise, or both interventions (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; 11 trials, 5162 women) (<LINK REF="REF-Muktabhant-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muktabhant 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of additional non-Cochrane systematic reviews have recently assessed a range of interventions, such as dietary advice, exercise, metformin, self-monitoring of weight gain, and probiotics for preventing GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Oostdam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostdam 2011</LINK>), behaviour-modification interventions for preventing GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Skouteris-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skouteris 2014</LINK>), lifestyle interventions for overweight and obese pregnant women for improving pregnancy outcomes, including GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Oteng_x002d_Ntim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oteng-Ntim 2012</LINK>), and 'nutritional manipulation in pregnancy' for preventing GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Rogozi_x0144_ska-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogozi&#324;ska 2015</LINK>). The methods of these reviews, and particularly their inclusion/exclusion criteria, differed to those employed in our review, and thus they have revealed some similar, and some contrasting findings.</P>
<P>For example, the <LINK REF="REF-Rogozi_x0144_ska-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogozi&#324;ska 2015</LINK> review (which included 20 randomised trials) assessed diet-based, mixed approach (diet and lifestyle) interventions, and nutritional supplements (myo-inositol and probiotics) and did not find a clear difference in GDM risk overall (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.15; six trials, 1479 women). With the same three trials included in our overweight and/or obese subgroup, the review similarly showed a reduced risk of GDM in overweight or obese women with diet-based interventions (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86; three trials, 455 women). The <LINK REF="REF-Oteng_x002d_Ntim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oteng-Ntim 2012</LINK> review (which included 13 randomised and six non-randomised trials, all in overweight and/or obese women), found that dietary and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy could reduce gestational weight gain (MD -2.21, 95% CI -2.86 to 1.59; 10 trials, 1228 women); this review also reported a trend towards a reduction in GDM risk (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.10, six trials, 1011 women) (<LINK REF="REF-Oteng_x002d_Ntim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oteng-Ntim 2012</LINK>) specifically for overweight and/or obese women, as was seen in our review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Skouteris-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skouteris 2014</LINK> (which included nine trials), did not pool data from individual studies in meta-analyses. <LINK REF="REF-Skouteris-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skouteris 2014</LINK> did however similarly conclude that the majority of trials incorporating 'behaviour change techniques' designed to prevent GDM as a primary or secondary outcome have not demonstrated clear effectiveness. <LINK REF="REF-Skouteris-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skouteris 2014</LINK>) highlighted the need for further research to inform the combination of information delivery and behaviour-modification techniques used to prevent GDM. <LINK REF="REF-Oostdam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostdam 2011</LINK> (including 19 studies assessing a variety of interventions for GDM prevention) reported that dietary counselling reduced GDM compared with standard care (risk difference (RD) -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01, seven trials, 813 women). Of note, the relevant meta-analysis in the <LINK REF="REF-Oostdam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostdam 2011</LINK> review, included data from some trials which were included in the <LINK REF="REF-Bain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2015</LINK> Cochrane review (where exercise advice or sessions were provided in addition to dietary advice). Further, the <LINK REF="REF-Oostdam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostdam 2011</LINK> review did not include a number of trials which have been included in our review (reported after its publication), and included data from the two intervention arms of <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 2009</LINK> (one of which assessed dietary advice and a probiotic; and thus this arm was excluded from our review).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:15:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:40:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a limited and incomplete body of evidence from randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary advice interventions for preventing gestational diabetes (GDM), which is insufficient to guide practice.</P>
<P>Very low-quality evidence from five trials of dietary advice interventions during pregnancy suggests a possible reduction in the risk of GDM for women receiving dietary advice versus standard care (five trials); current evidence suggests that this reduction may be greater for women who are overweight and or obese. Low-quality evidence from four trials suggests no clear difference in GDM risk between low- versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice (four trials). Where reported, no clear differences were seen for the review's other primary outcomes (pre-eclampsia; perinatal mortality; large-for-gestational age; neonatal mortality and morbidity composite), except for a possible reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension for women receiving dietary advice. There were very little outcome data and few differences observed for the majority of the review's secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>For outcomes assessed using GRADE, the evidence was considered to be low to very low quality, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and inconsistency.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:15:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In light of the limitations associated with the current evidence, further randomised controlled trials are warranted to determine the effects of dietary advice interventions during pregnancy on prevention of GDM and other relevant adverse health consequences for women and their babies. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed to assess women's adherence and views, and to allow important differences in relevant clinical outcomes for women and babies to be detected, including longer-term infant, child and/or adult outcomes and those related to the use and costs of health services. In view of the subgroup analyses observing greater treatment effect in overweight and obese women, who are at higher risk of GDM, exploring treatment effect in high-risk subgroups could be of value. Such trials should aim to collect and report on core outcomes for GDM research, such as those that are pre-specified in the review.</P>
<P>Five additional trials have been identified as being planned or underway, and four are awaiting classification (pending the availability of further information). These trials are assessing a variety of dietary advice interventions during pregnancy, for preventing adverse health outcomes for women and their babies, including GDM, and will be considered for inclusion in the next update of this review.</P>

<P>Women received a set of booklets, and were counselled to follow a conventional healthy diet with recommended foods and serving sizes as noted in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and were not given any guidance on the GI.</P>
<P>Both groups: women received a detailed dietary education tailored for the assigned diet and their individual requirements for pregnancy; there was no intended difference in macronutrient distribution in diets. Women in both groups were counselled to adopt diets that were consistent with nationally recommended nutritional intake for pregnant women and recommendations of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.</P>
<P>For all women there were 4 contact points in pregnancy.</P>
<P>1) First visit: at the first visit, a 3-day food record was reviewed, and details clarified. Diet education was given, specific to assigned group by the research dietitian.</P>
<P>2) Phone call: a phone call was made at 4 weeks after the initial visit to ensure adherence to the prescribed diet and goals set, identify barriers and other dietary issues/concerns.</P>
<P>3) Midway assessment: dietitian reviewed women face-to-face at 28 weeks before their obstetric appointment to monitor progress and address any new issues.</P>
<P>4) Final visit: as late as possible (minimum 34 weeks) the dietitian collected and reviewed the final 3-day food record, and measured final weight.</P>
<P>The research dietitian was available for telephone queries outside of scheduled visits. An email was sent monthly (5 in total) to all women who provided an email address, with content dependent on group (nutrition tips and recipes).</P>
