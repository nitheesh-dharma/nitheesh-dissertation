<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are resorbable (biodegradable) plates better than titanium (metal) plates for the fixation of facial bones after corrective (orthognathic) jaw surgery?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Under- or overgrowth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function and an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects. Treatment of severe cases may require a combination of orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery. After surgery the cut bone needs to be immobilised to ensure that optimal healing takes place. Titanium plates used for fixation are recognised to be the 'gold standard' but recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased use of bioresorbable plates or screws for corrective jaw surgery. The use of bioresorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones might appear to reduce the need for a further operation for the removal of metal plates. However, whilst resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their resorption (being reabsorbed), the possibility of foreign body reactions, and with some of the technical difficulties experienced with resorbable plates.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included two studies that analysed a total of 103 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 20 January 2017. Study participants were adults older than 16 years of age. One study compared titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. One study was conducted in China, the other in Germany.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for the fixation of bones after corrective jaw surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Both included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the very limited and weak evidence was of very low quality.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-20 16:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. All participants in one trial suffered mild to moderate postoperative discomfort with no statistically significant difference between the two plating groups at different follow-up times. Mean scores of patient satisfaction were 7.43 to 8.63 (range 0 to 10) with no statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout follow-up. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. Plate exposures occurred mainly in the posterior maxillary region, except for one titanium plate exposure in the mandibular premolar region. Known causes of infection were associated with loosened screws and wound dehiscence with no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between titanium (3/196), and resorbable (3/165) plates.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 22:00:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Under- or over-developmental growth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function in addition to an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects on the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Rumsey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumsey 2005</LINK>). Orthodontic treatment may be useful if the discrepancies are minor, but in more severe cases a combination of treatment with orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery may be required. This combined treatment can be time consuming, complex, costly and very demanding of both patient and clinician (<LINK REF="REF-Bousaba-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousaba 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 21:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>After orthognathic surgery the sectioned (cut) bone needs to be fixed or immobilised to ensure that healing takes place. Previously the only method of achieving this was by intraosseous wiring coupled with rigid intermaxillary (upper to lower jaw) fixation. More recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased usage of titanium and bioresorbable osteosynthesis plates or screws, either separately or in combination, to achieve fixation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-18 22:08:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Titanium plates are considered the 'gold standard' for internal fixation in craniomaxillofacial surgery and although they are reportedly biocompatible, titanium particles, which are thought to be due to corrosion of the titanium, have been found in scar tissue covering these plates as well as in locoregional lymph nodes. As the need for fixation is only temporary, at least until the bone has united, the removal of these plates after completion of the healing process has been advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Haers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haers 1998</LINK>) and although there does not appear to be a consensus in agreement for their removal, this is routinely undertaken in some countries. Some of the additional disadvantages of these metallic materials relate to their extreme stiffness which it is suggested may cause stress shielding of the underlying bone. The potential shortcomings of metallic fixation devices used in orthopaedic and orthognathic surgery are fairly well recognised and have led to the development of plates manufactured from bioresorbable materials e.g. polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone.</P>
<P>The use of these biologically inert and resorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones in orthognathic surgery would appear to offer some clinical advantages over metal plates by eliminating the possible need for a second operation for their removal (<LINK REF="REF-Mohamed_x002d_Hashem-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohamed-Hashem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1997</LINK>). Also, combinations of titanium and resorbable plates have been used for internal fixation of isolated zygomatic (cheek bone) maxillary complex (ZMC) fractures in the adult (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hochuli_x002d_Vieira-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochuli-Vieira 2005</LINK>). In another study, orthognathic surgery was completed on the maxilla (upper jaw) with rigid fixation using titanium miniplates and screws in addition to bone biological plates, the combination of which seemed to substantially improve skeletal stability (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-04 14:21:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, but concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their degradation and the possibility of foreign body reactions. It is also reported that resorbable plates when used alone may not be able to withstand the physiological forces of masticatory muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Hanemann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanemann 2005</LINK>). Clinical complications such as inflammatory foreign body reactions, osteolysis around screws and delayed resorption have been reported with the use of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid materials (<LINK REF="REF-Bergsma-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergsma 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohamed_x002d_Hashem-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohamed-Hashem 2000</LINK>). In addition, a small number of material-related failures have been seen when these resorbable materials were used in bimaxillary procedures without postoperative rigid intermaxillary fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Haers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haers 1998</LINK>). Postoperative infection is another important complication which can occur with either system. Loose screws and wound dehiscence have been implicated, either of which may lead to plate exposure and subsequent early plate removal (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>). It is imperative to find out which material out of the two is better. This review compares the use of titanium versus bioresorbable plates in orthognathic surgery and is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Fedorowicz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedorowicz 2007</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK> was a prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the University of Hong Kong, China from July 2001 to April 2003. <LINK REF="STD-Weidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weidner 2005</LINK> was a prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in the Medical Faculty of the Würzburg University, Germany from June 1995 to April 1997.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 103 participants across the two studies were included. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>) included surgeries to correct maxillary and mandibular deformities, while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Weidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weidner 2005</LINK>) included exclusively mandibular surgeries.</P>
<P>Sixty adults (18 male, 42 female), of 16 to 37 years (mean 22.9) of age, entered <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>. The majority of participants (61.7%) were aged between 20 and 29 years, and the remainder were aged between 16 and 19 years (28.3%), and between 30 and 39 years (10%). In both intervention groups, the male to female ratio was 1:2.3. All of the participants had previously attended the Orthognathic Assessment Clinic for management of their dentofacial deformities and had completed their orthodontic treatment prior to entering the study. Facial deformities of the maxilla accounted for 60% (36/60) maxillary hypoplasia, 26.7% (16/60) excessive vertical maxillary height, and 8.3% (5/60) maxillary dentoalveolar hyperplasia of the participants enrolled into the trial. The remaining 5% of participants had anterior open bites with maxillary hyperplasia. Mandibular deformities in the participants included 30% (18/60) with mandibular hyperplasia, 21.7% (13/60) mandibular dentoalveolar hyperplasia, 20% (12/60) unilateral condylar hyperplasia with mandibular asymmetry, 13.3% (8/60) mandibular hypoplasia, and 15% (9/60) had normally proportioned mandibles. Of the total, 6.7% (4/60) were also diagnosed with geniohypoplasia.</P>
<P>Sixty adults requiring either a mandibular setback or advancement procedure entered <LINK REF="STD-Weidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weidner 2005</LINK>, 12 of which were eventually excluded due to insufficient data and a further five who underwent an alternative surgical procedure were also excluded. All of the 43 (27 female, 16 male) participants underwent a forward advancement procedure of the mandible. The majority (56%) were aged 20 to 29 years, 30% were 30 to 39 years, 9% were aged below 20 years, and 5% were over 40 years of age. Patients who needed bimaxillary osteotomy or who had a history of immunodeficiency disease, cancer, any skin diseases, infections, alcoholism, rheumatism or had a fractured mandible were excluded from the study. Prior to surgery all of the participants underwent orthodontic treatment, with the stated objective of providing "a satisfactory vertical, sagittal and transverse alignment of the dental arches." No additional details of any preoperative treatment were provided in this report. At enrolment all participants received a "clinical and functional assessment" which included a subjective and objective analysis of any symptoms, measurement of their maximal jaw opening and recording of the occlusal relationship of the standing teeth.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>, all of the participants underwent orthognathic surgery: Le Fort I (28.8%), maxillary subapical osteotomy (5%), mandibular subapical osteotomy (19.2%), mandibular body osteotomy (3.4%), vertical subsigmoid (32.2%), sagittal split (8.5%), and genioplasty (3.4%). The patients were randomised prior to surgery to either a resorbable plating group (n = 30) or a titanium plating group (n = 30) for fixation. The Compact 2.0 pure titanium plating system (Mathys Medical Ltd, Bettlach, Switzerland) was used for the titanium group, and the BiosorbFX bioresorbable fixation system (Bionx Implants Inc, Tampere, Finland) made of self-reinforced poly-L/DL lactic acid copolymer (70% L-lactide and 30% D-lactide) for the resorbable group. The study included 177 osteotomies, of which 87 were fixated with 196 titanium plates and 784 titanium screws, and 90 osteotomies were fixated with 165 resorbable plates and 658 resorbable screws.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Weidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weidner 2005</LINK>, all 43 participants underwent a set back procedure of the mandible consisting of a retromolar sagittal osteotomy (Obwegeser and Dal-Pont). They were randomised to either titanium screws (Stryker-Leibinger) (n = 20), or resorbable screws (Isosorb®-Schraube, Aesculap Tuttlingen) (n = 23) made of biodegradable lactopolymer (Poly- (L-co-DL-LA) (90/10))/(Poly (DL-LA) (80/20)). The report provided very little detail on the exact surgical procedure other than that two screws were used in each procedure and placed where possible either side of the mandibular canal and that no additional external fixation was used in either group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK> followed up participants 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Of the 60 patients, 48 (24 titanium, 24 resorbable) were followed up for at least 1 year and six patients from the titanium group and seven from the resorbable group were reviewed for at least 2 years. A set of standard radiographs was taken at each follow-up appointment in addition to a recording of the number and type of broken plates and screws. Postoperative self-assessments were carried out by the patients, using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 10), for wound discomfort (0 = pain free, 10 = severe pain), clinical stability of the osteotomy segment (0 = very mobile, 10 = no mobility), satisfaction with the result (0 = very unsatisfied, 10 = very satisfied), and palpability of the plates. Objective assessments which were made postoperatively by the surgeons included: wound dehiscence, non-infected sinus formation, plate exposure, the degree of palpability of the plates, the mobility of the osteotomised segments and the presence of infection based on pain, swelling and pus discharge.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Weidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weidner 2005</LINK>, participants were examined and had lateral skull radiographs taken at six time intervals: before orthodontic treatment (T0), preoperatively (T1), 0 to 3 months postoperatively (T2), 4 to 8 months postoperatively (T3), 9 to 14 months postoperatively (T4), and 15 months postoperatively (T5). Attendance by the 43 participants for follow-up appointments was inconsistent and consequently the number of lateral skull radiographs taken at different time periods was incomplete i.e. at the T0 appointment (21 resorbable, 18 titanium), T1 (18 resorbable, 19 titanium), T2 (7 resorbable, 8 titanium), T3 (14 resorbable, 16 titanium), T4 (7 resorbable, 7 titanium), T5 (15 resorbable, 8 titanium). Postoperative changes in several parameters (SNB angle, ANB angle, SN-Pog angle, mandibular inclination, Gonion angle), were recorded and analysed by a computer program after scanning of the lateral skull radiographs. The stability of these parameters was evaluated at the follow-up appointments.</P>

<P>Both included studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. It is unclear whether participants, operators or assessors were blinded, but in view of the nature of the intervention, blinding of the surgeons to the type of intervention was not possible in the studies. As some of the postoperative clinical outcomes were evaluated by the surgeons, who were most likely aware which of the patients had received which intervention, this criterion was graded as high risk. In addition, metal plates can be easily identified from resorbable plates and postoperative examination of either plates can reveal the nature of the material, hence the high risk assessment.</P>

<P>In order that the data could be more readily and widely understood we transformed the data from 'grad' into 'degrees' using the online convertor <A HREF="http://www.1728.com/angles.htm?b0=6">www.1728.com/angles.htm?b0=6</A> (accessed 31 January 2017). However, as a result of inconsistencies in the original data these transformed measured values cannot be considered interpretable in a quantitative sense and therefore the conclusions reached may be suspect. In the absence of any reliable data reflecting treatment outcomes for the active intervention or comparison, in this trial, we have not included any of the data for this outcome in our review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Re-operation and revision rate separated into minor revision (closed reduction) or major revision (removal of the plates or open reduction of the osteotomy)</HEADING>
<P>Plate removal rates were 1.53% (3/196) of the titanium plates and 3.63% (6/165) of the resorbable ones. Out of a total of nine, two in each group were removed because of plate exposure, one patient in the titanium and three patients in the resorbable group because of infection, and one patient in the resorbable group for non-purulent sinus tract.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exposure of the plate</HEADING>
<P>Both titanium and resorbable groups experienced two plate exposures which occurred between the third and ninth month with plate exposure rates for the titanium group of 1.02%, and 1.21% for the resorbable group. All of the plate exposures occurred in the posterior maxillary region, except in one titanium case which occurred in the mandibular premolar region. None of the exposed plates became infected, but all of the exposed plates ultimately required removal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Superficial wound infection (infection of the wound without evidence of spread towards the site of the plates) and deep wound infection (infection around the plates)</HEADING>
<P>The trialists did not differentiate between superficial or deep wound infection. Three (10%) of the patients in each of the two groups developed infections accounting for six plates i.e. 3/196 (1.53%) in the titanium group and 3/165 (1.82%) in the resorbable group. There was no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between fixation with titanium or resorbable plates P = 0.83 (published value P = 0.67).</P>
<P>All three of the infected plates in the resorbable group were removed in order to resolve the infection. One infected plate in the titanium group was removed but the remaining two titanium plates were retained and the infection was resolved by wound irrigation and antibiotic therapy. The trialists stated that infections in the resorbable group occurred relatively later than in the titanium group and that the causes of infection appeared to be related to loosened screws and wound dehiscence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Occurrence of sinus tract</HEADING>
<P>Five patients (three in the titanium group and two in the resorbable group) developed a non-infected sinus tract. The sinus tracts arose earlier in the titanium group (sixth week) than in the resorbable group (third and sixth month). Three of the tracts in the titanium group and one in the resorbable group resolved spontaneously after irrigation only. The one remaining patient in the resorbable group eventually required removal of the affected plate connected to the sinus tract.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Wound dehiscence</HEADING>
<P>Three patients (10%) in the titanium group and two patients (6.7%) in the resorbable group presented with wound dehiscence. One patient in each group with dehisced wounds became infected. All the non-infected wounds closed spontaneously in less than 6 months postoperatively.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-04 12:25:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. We found insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-27 12:01:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, this review shows there is lack of evidence on the effects of using titanium or resorbable plates for stabilization of bones after orthognathic surgery. Not all outcomes were reported in the studies included, and those which were reported, do not give us any statistically or clinically significant effects favouring either plate.</P>
<P>One study reported high attrition rate, and for long-term patient-related outcomes of wound discomfort and satisfaction, there was also high attrition. High adherence and follow-up should be maintained for these outcomes. There was also considerable heterogeneity in the population, in terms of the jaw being treated.</P>
<P>Stricter protocols should be instilled that encourage adherence to follow-up and the inclusion of outcome measures such as objective postoperative aesthetic, functional, and morbid status of the participants right after the surgery.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-04 14:08:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included two randomised controlled trials analysing 103 participants. We found insufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. The very limited and weak evidence was considered to be of very low quality. The reasons for downgrading were mostly due to imprecision (wide confidence intervals), indirectness (single study), high risk of performance and detection bias (blinding being a major limitation of these studies as it is quite impractical to blind the operating surgeon as metal can be easily identified from bioresorbable plates), and inconsistency (a subgroup analysis should have been performed for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2004</LINK>) which considered maxillary and mandibular osteotomies as the same population).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-09-27 12:42:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of language bias while identifying and selecting studies for inclusion in a systematic review is widely recognised; thus, we ensured that language was not an exclusion criterion. We made all attempts in limiting biases in the review process by performing a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies. The authors' independent assessments of study eligibility for inclusion in this review minimised the potential for selection bias. Although it would be acceptable to think that the comprehensive searches will have identified all existing randomised controlled trials, and thereby helped to limit bias in the conduct of this review, the absence of any high-quality published trials for surgical approach over recent years creates measure of uncertainty and there could be some unpublished studies which might add to the overall evidence.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-27 12:47:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three reviews have been published comparing resorbable and metal plates, and all three of them state that resorbable plates are as stable as metal plates (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Moraissi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Moraissi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joss-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joss 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2014</LINK>). This Cochrane Review sought high-level evidence for the effects of bioresorbable fixation systems compared with titanium systems used for orthognathic surgery. Only two eligible studies were included in this review, one of which solely evaluated the orthodontic related treatment results of both plating systems and provided very little other data.<BR/>Whilst recognising the methodological limitations of these two studies, their clinical heterogeneity, the incompleteness of their data relevant to this systematic review, and the likelihood of bias in respect of outcome assessment in both, we have nevertheless chosen to include them but advise some caution in the interpretation of their results.</P>

<P>We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-04 14:22:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review confirm the necessity for further larger sampled, methodologically sound trials that are reported according to the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>). Although further research is required, the possibility exists that well-informed patients may be unwilling to consent unwittingly to enrolment into a trial where they may be allocated to titanium plating, more especially if there is likely to be a requirement for follow-up surgery to remove the titanium plates after healing has taken place.</P>
<P>Trialists should recognise and try to ensure that any patient-reported outcomes, especially if used to measure pain, are supported by a validated and internationally recognised pain scale that has the discriminatory capacity in terms of both bandwidth and fidelity appropriate for this type of intervention. The value of these patient-reported outcomes could be further enhanced by trialists reporting the type, amount and frequency of any analgesia used to control and relieve postoperative pain. In addition, consideration should be given to the inclusion of outcome measures that assess the ability of patients to eat, swallow and speak, as well as any other postoperative functional disabilities which might arise after orthognathic surgery.</P>
<P>To help minimise the effects of systematic bias in outcome assessment it would be prudent if in future trials the trialists or the surgeons carrying out the intervention are not included as evaluators of outcomes and that appropriate training is given to independent assessors to ensure standardisation of criteria to be used in any outcome assessments.</P>
<P>Costs, not least of all in low- to middle-income countries, are an important consideration in the provision of care and therefore it would be beneficial if future randomised controlled trials for this research question could provide more information on the costs of materials, equipment used with each of the fixation systems, and direct and indirect costs related to hospitalisation and lost time from work or employment.</P>
