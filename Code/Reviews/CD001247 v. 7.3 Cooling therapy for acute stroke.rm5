<P>Stroke is a life-threatening event in which part of the brain stops functioning properly, because it either does not receive blood and oxygen or it is damaged by bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel. Interventions to reduce temperature may protect brain tissue from damage during stroke. Previous studies have shown that patients with a lower body temperature at the time of stroke have a better outcome than those with a higher body temperature. To reduce death or disability, temperature-lowering therapy is used in open-heart surgery, after cardiac arrest and in babies who may have suffered from a lack of oxygen at birth. By contrast, the therapeutic effect of temperature-lowering therapy in patients with traumatic brain injury is less promising. Besides its potential beneficial effects, temperature-lowering therapy may have adverse effects including chest infection, venous thrombosis or cardiac arrhythmias. This review aimed to assess the potential benefits and risks of temperature-lowering therapy in patients with acute stroke. All studies that compared the use of physical or pharmacological temperature-lowering therapies on acute stroke with usual medical management in acute stroke patients were considered. Physical temperature-lowering techniques included cooling blankets, cooling fluids, cooling helmets and other devices. Pharmacological temperature-lowering interventions included drugs used to reduce temperature. The results of the five included pharmacological and three physical temperature reduction trials, involving 423 participants with acute stroke, do not indicate a clinical benefit or harm. Both interventions were associated with a slight increase in the occurrence of infections, but this was not statistically significant. A clinically significant effect of temperature-lowering therapy on outcome after stroke was not demonstrated, but cannot be ruled out. Large clinical trials are therefore needed to assess the effect of temperature-lowering therapies in acute stroke.</P>

<P>Increased body temperatures are common in patients with acute stroke and are associated with poor outcome. In animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia, temperature-lowering therapy reduces infarct volume. In patients with acute stroke, lowering temperature may therefore improve outcome. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-01 13:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched December 2007). In addition, we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1998 to December 2007). We scanned references and contacted authors of included trials. For the previous version of this review, the authors contacted pharmaceutical companies and manufactures of cooling equipment in this field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-31 13:42:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We considered all completed randomised or non-randomised controlled clinical trials, published or unpublished, where pharmacological or physical strategies or both to reduce temperature were applied in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. Outcome measures were death or dependency (modified Rankin Scale score &#8805; 3) at the end of follow up, and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 13:46:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted and cross-checked the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-31 13:43:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included five pharmacological temperature reduction trials and three physical cooling trials involving a total of 423 participants. We found no statistically significant effect of pharmacological or physical temperature-lowering therapy in reducing the risk of death or dependency (odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 1.4) or death (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.5). Both interventions were associated with a non-significant increase in the occurrence of infections.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-18 09:43:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and the second cause of disability in high-income countries. As stroke incidence rises exponentially with age, the ageing of the world's population will increase its socio-economic impact (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2006</LINK>). This calls for effective treatments that are easy to administer and also cost-effective. Unfortunately, treatment of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage has remained unsatisfactory. In patients with ischaemic stroke, aspirin administered within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms reduces the risk of disability or death by only 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>). Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within three hours of symptom onset increases the absolute probability of a good outcome by 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2003</LINK>). However, intravenous thrombolysis is only available for a limited number of patients, mainly because of the current time window to treatment of three hours. Intra-arterial thrombolysis with recombinant pro-urokinase within six hours of stroke onset results in a similar improvement of functional outcome, but the procedures required to deliver the thrombolytic agent to the site of vascular occlusion take more precious time and have their own complications (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 1999</LINK>). No other pharmacological treatment modalities have been proven effective in acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>One approach to develop new stroke treatment strategies is to influence physiologic parameters that have been proven to be related to outcome. One of these factors is body temperature. Body temperature is increased in 4% to 25 % of patients with acute ischaemic stroke within the first six hours after symptom onset (<LINK REF="REF-Azzimondi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azzimondi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boysen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boysen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castillo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1996</LINK>). The pathophysiology of this increase in body temperature is not completely understood. On the one hand, increased body temperature may be a natural consequence of brain infarction. However, animal studies have suggested that increased body temperatures may increase the damage induced by cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Chopp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dietrich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietrich 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Globus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>). Observational studies in patients with acute stroke have shown an association between increased body temperature and poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Azzimondi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azzimondi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boysen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boysen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castillo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1996</LINK>). This association may be limited to the first 12 to 24 hours from stroke onset (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1996</LINK>). These studies therefore suggest that control of body temperature and prevention of fever may improve functional outcome after stroke.</P>
<P>In a systematic review of animal studies, therapeutic hypothermia reduced infarct size by 44% (95% confidence interval (CI) 40 to 47%). Efficacy was highest with temperature reduction to lower temperatures (&#8804; 31 °C), when treatment was started before or at the onset of ischaemia, and in temporary rather than permanent ischaemia models. However, a reduction in infarct volume by about one third was also observed with temperature reduction to 35 °C, with initiation of treatment between 90 and 180 minutes, and in permanent ischaemia models (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007a</LINK>). The effects of hypothermia on functional outcome were broadly similar (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007a</LINK>). This suggests that temperature-lowering therapy might be efficacious under conditions that are achievable for large numbers of patients with ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>Profound hypothermia has been applied for many years in open-heart surgery to counter the effects of cerebral hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Chyatte-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chyatte 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saccani-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saccani 1992</LINK>). Furthermore, mild therapeutic hypothermia improves functional outcome and survival in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2005</LINK>) and in infants with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Shankaran-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankaran 2005</LINK>). By contrast, the therapeutic effect of hypothermia in patients with traumatic brain injury is less promising (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review aims to assess the relation between interventions to reduce body or brain temperature and functional outcome in patients with acute stroke and to determine whether there is any clear evidence that reduction in temperature of any kind is beneficial, or whether the intervention is sufficiently promising to merit further trials. Several studies have suggested that temperature-lowering therapy may be associated with an increased risk of infections, cardiac arrhythmias, haemorrhagic transformation of infarcts, and venous thrombosis (<LINK REF="STD-De-Georgia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Georgia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krieger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwab-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 1998</LINK>). In this review, we will specifically address this issue.</P>

The numbers of trial participants ranged from 42 to 76 in the pharmacological temperature reduction studies and from 19 to 77 in the physical temperature reduction studies. Imaging with CT or MRI was performed before randomisation in all patients. One physical temperature reduction study and one pharmacological temperature reduction study included both ischaemic stroke patients and patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Kammersgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kammersgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kasner 2002</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-18 09:43:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In this review, we analysed the available randomised and non-randomised controlled trials of temperature-lowering therapy in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage. We identified five randomised pharmacological temperature reduction studies, one randomised physical temperature reduction study, and two non-randomised controlled physical temperature reduction studies. The authors of the previous version of this Cochrane review did not identify any randomised pharmacological or physical temperature reduction trials.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The studies included in this review provide no evidence that either pharmacological or physical temperature-lowering therapy in the acute phase of stroke decreases the risk of death or dependency. Several factors may explain the observed lack of treatment effect.</P>
<P>First of all, the total number of participants included in these studies was far too small and the interventions too heterogeneous for definitive conclusions. Moreover, all studies were designed to test safety and feasibility, and allowed rather long time periods between stroke onset and start of treatment, which may lower the likelihood of observing an effect of treatment.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the pharmacological temperature reduction studies, the mean body temperature at 24 hours after the start of treatment was 0.2 °C lower in the treatment group than in the control group (95% CI -0.3 to -0.2 °C). This small effect may seem insignificant, but may prove to be clinically relevant as in an observational study the relative risk of poor outcome rose by a factor of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4 to 3.5) with each °C increase in body temperature (<LINK REF="REF-Reith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1996</LINK>). Data on body temperature during physical temperature reduction trials were insufficient for a pooled analysis.</P>
<P>Several other methodological issues such as the method of measuring body or brain temperature and the timing, size and duration of the temperature reduction, may turn out to be important determinants of treatment effect, but they remain as yet unresolved in this review.</P>
<P>In all studies except one, body temperature was assessed with a tympanic, rectal or a bladder thermometer. One study monitored oesophageal temperature. No studies determined brain temperature. A study of eight patients with traumatic brain injury studied the correlation between temperatures measured rectally or in the bladder and those measured in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Henker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henker 1998</LINK>). Brain temperature was found to be 1 °C to 2 °C higher than rectal and bladder temperatures. Differences were largest when the rectal or bladder temperatures were higher than 38 °C. As temperatures in all included trials were assessed with rectal, bladder, or tympanic thermometry, the brain temperature in these patients may have been underestimated, and the body temperature reduction may not be representative for brain temperature reduction. On the other hand, all clinical prognostic studies and most animal experiments have suggested a benefit of temperature reduction reported body temperatures and not brain temperatures. In addition, in another longitudinal study of 20 patients with traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid haemorrhage and fever the mean difference between body and brain temperature was only 0.3 °C (SD 0.3 °C) (<LINK REF="REF-Rossi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In ischaemic stroke, temperature-lowering therapy may reduce tissue damage via several mechanisms, including protection of the blood-brain barrier, suppression of the release of excitatory amino acids and free radicals, lowering the cerebral metabolic rate, and anti-inflammatory actions (<LINK REF="REF-Chopp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dietrich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietrich 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dietrich-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietrich 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Globus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globus 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>). The mechanisms underlying a possible benefit of temperature-lowering therapy in intracerebral haemorrhage are less clear.</P>
<P>However, observational studies have shown an association between increased body temperatures and poor outcome both in ischaemic stroke patients and in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Azzimondi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azzimondi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boysen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boysen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2000</LINK>). As only one physical temperature reduction trial and one pharmacological temperature reduction trial included patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and patients with ischaemic stroke and all other studies included patients with ischaemic stroke only, we did not perform subgroup analysis for ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Due to the lack of sufficient data, no conclusion can be drawn on the maximum time window to treatment, the optimal target temperature, and duration of temperature-lowering therapy.</P>
<P>Animal studies have suggested that although the efficacy of temperature-lowering therapy is largest when started before or at the onset of ischaemia, there is still substantial benefit when this is delayed for up to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007a</LINK>). On the other hand, observational studies have suggested that increased body temperatures measured up to 24 hours after stroke onset are associated with poor outcome. (<LINK REF="REF-Azzimondi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azzimondi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boysen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boysen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castillo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reith 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similar uncertainty exists on the optimal duration of treatment. In animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia, pathophysiological processes exert their deleterious effects over various time courses, extending from the first hours to several days after vessel occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Dirnagl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dirnagl 1999</LINK>). Such observations may imply that temperature-lowering therapy should be more efficacious if prolonged. On the other hand, longer durations of treatment were not associated with improved outcomes in a meta-analysis of hypothermia in animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia, and the risk of side effects such as infections may increase with longer durations of hypothermia (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007a</LINK>). In clinical trials of cardiac arrest, temperature-lowering therapy has been proven efficacious if maintained for 12 or 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the optimal target temperature in acute stroke is under debate. In animal studies of focal cerebral ischaemia, efficacy was highest with temperatures below 32 °C, but infarct volume was still reduced by about one-third after cooling to 35 °C (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Worp-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Worp 2007a</LINK>). In the above-mentioned cardiac arrest trials, the target temperature was 32 °C to 34 °C (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2005</LINK>). However, for comfort, monitoring, and the prevention of shivering, temperature-lowering therapy to such levels generally requires sedation, mechanical ventilation, and therefore admission to an intensive care unit. Given the limited availability of intensive care beds in most countries, cooling to temperatures around 33 °C is therefore highly impractical, even in the setting of a clinical trial. In addition, sedation and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of side effects.</P>
<P>Even when temperature reduction leads to preservation and recovery of brain tissue, its beneficial effect may be offset by adverse events. All pharmacological and physical temperature reduction studies included in this review reported on the occurrence of infections. In these trials, temperature reduction did not lead to a statistically significant increase in the incidence of infections.Two physical temperature reduction trials and one pharmacological temperature reduction trial reported symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation of an infarct or intracranial haemorrhage in the active treatment group, but numbers are too small for definitive conclusions. None of the trials were terminated prematurely because of these side effects or other side effects.</P>
<P>Trials of physical interventions to lower temperature seem to be of lower methodological quality than pharmacological temperature reduction trials. This can partly be explained by the nature of the intervention, which prohibits a double-blind design. However, in most intervention studies, blind assessment of outcome and allocation concealment and a proper randomisation procedure should be feasible.</P>
<P>We need further studies of temperature reduction in acute stroke that explore the optimal cooling strategy, intensity, and duration in terms of feasibility, safety, and, ultimately, efficacy. Based on this review we can make several recommendations to improve the quality of new intervention studies of temperature reduction in acute stroke. The next generation of trials should measure body core temperature in all treated patients, should systematically assess and report adverse events, should use proper treatment allocation schemes and be properly blinded, at least for the assessment of the primary outcome.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the six randomised and two controlled temperature reduction studies included in this review do not provide sufficient evidence for routine use of strategies to reduce temperature in patients with acute stroke. Large randomised clinical trials are needed to study the effect of both physical and pharmacological temperature reduction strategies.</P>

<P>Increased body temperatures following stroke are associated with poor outcome. Animal studies have shown that temperature reduction may reduce brain tissue damage incurred by focal cerebral ischaemia. In man, temperature-lowering therapy has been proven effective in preventing death and dependency in patients who were resuscitated after cardiac arrest. These findings suggest that therapeutic hypothermia may also improve outcome in patients with acute stroke. Hence, further large randomised clinical trails are needed to study the safety, optimal duration and the effectiveness of both physical and medical temperature reduction in patients with acute stroke. Attention should be paid to trial quality issues, including randomisation, blind outcome assessment, relevant intervention contrast and relevant outcome measures. In addition, it is important that these trials should pay attention to the occurrence of infections and to the recording of temperature.</P>
