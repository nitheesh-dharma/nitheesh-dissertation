<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Anticholinergic drugs are widely used in the management of both acute and chronic asthma in children. Their effect is achieved through relief of narrowing of the airways that occurs in asthma. Current guidelines for the management of chronic asthma advise that anticholinergic drugs may be used if children are already on high dose inhaled steroids. This study undertook a comprehensive search of the literature unrestricted by country of publication or language. Unfortunately small numbers of relevant trials were found and these were of variable quality. This review found that although anticholinergic drugs are well tolerated, in children over two years of age, there is not enough data to be sure if they are better than placebo in terms of effects on lung function or symptoms. </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials in which anticholinergic drugs were given for chronic asthma in children over 2 years of age were included. Studies including comparison of: anticholinergics with placebo, and anticholinergics with any other drug were included.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Three papers compared the effects of anticholinergic drugs with placebo, and a meta-analysis of these results demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of the use of anticholinergic drugs over placebo in any of the outcome measures used. The results of one of these trials could not be included in the meta-analysis but the authors did report significantly lower symptom scores with inhaled anticholinergics compared with placebo. However, there was no significant difference between ipratropium bromide and placebo in the percentage of symptom-free nights or days. Two trials studied the effects of anticholinergics on bronchial hyper responsiveness to histamine, by measuring the provocation dose of histamine needed to cause a fall of 20 % in FEV1 (PD 20). One study (comparing anticholinergics with placebo) reported a statistically significant increase in PD 20 but this was not found in another study (comparing anticholinergics with a beta-2 agonist). Both trials also examined the effect of anticholinergic drugs on diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and reported no significant effect. Two studies compared the addition of an anticholinergic drug to a beta-2 agonist with the beta-2 agonist alone. Both trials failed to show any significant benefit from the long term use of combined anticholinergics with beta-2 agonists compared with beta-2 agonists alone. One trial compared the effects of oral and inhaled anticholinergic drugs with placebo. No statistically significant differences were found in any of the outcome measures except for a higher FEV1 / VC ratio and RV / TLC ratio with oral anticholinergic therapy when compared with placebo.</P>

<P>The present review summarises the best evidence available to date. Although there were some small beneficial findings in favour of anticholinergic therapy, there is insufficient data to support the use of anticholinergic drugs in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-17 08:59:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The cholinergic (muscarinic) sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the intrinsic system of controlling airway calibre. Anticholinergic, anti muscarinic bronchodilators such as ipratropium bromide are frequently used in the management of childhood airway disease. In asthma, ipratropium is a less potent bronchodilator than beta-2 adrenergic agents but it is known to be a useful adjunct to other therapies, particularly in status asthmaticus. What remains to be proved is the role of anticholinergic drugs in chronic asthma.</P>
<P>The medicinal benefits of atropine and other naturally occurring anticholinergic alkaloids have been known for many centuries. Atropine, an alkaloid extract of belladonna, is extracted from the Datura stramonium plant. These agents were first used in western medicine in the early 1800s after British colonists learned of their uses in India. By the middle of the 19 th century, belladonna agents were widely used and were the sole bronchodilating agents available. In the 1920s, epinephrine was discovered, followed by the methylxanthines, replacing belladonna alkaloids as bronchodilating agents (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>). Part of this declining use was due to the side effects of atropine. However, the development of synthetic analogues of atropine, which retained good anticholinergic activity with minimal side effects, resulted in a resurgence of interest. The most studied, and now most widely used of these agents is Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent, formerly known as Sch 1000) (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ipratropium bromide (IB) is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. It acts at muscarinic receptors, competitively inhibiting the effects of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts by causing smooth muscle constriction, which provides broncho motor tone. By antagonising the effects of acetylcholine, cholinergic broncho motor tone is inhibited and the vagal reflexes that mediate bronchoconstriction are blocked.</P>
<P>Since the introduction of inhaled anticholinergic agents, their clinical uses have been explored in many diseases. It is now becoming apparent that these drugs are regarded as first-line broncho dilatory agents in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no equivalent in childhood disease. COPD generally occurs after years of smoking and is characterised by chronic mucus secretion, airway infection and variable airway hyper responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In children, anticholinergic agents are used in the management of several diseases, including broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD), bronchiolitis, viral induced wheeze and asthma. </P>
<P>Many definitions of asthma exist and the term itself is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Keeley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 1999</LINK>). Asthma may be defined as "reversible airways obstruction associated with bronchial hyper reactivity, allergic inflammation of the airways and a response to treatment with bronchodilators with regular prophylactic inhaled anti-inflammatory agents" (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1997</LINK>). More simply, it may be defined as "episodic cough and / or wheeze in a clinical setting, where asthma is likely and other rarer conditions have been excluded" (<LINK REF="REF-Doull-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doull 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>The initial management of acute severe asthma in the paediatric setting involves rapid relief of bronchospasm with inhaled or nebulised bronchodilators. Children who do not fully respond require corticosteroids in addition. Beta-2 agonists provide a rapid bronchodilating effect and are the most widely used bronchodilators in acute severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1996</LINK>). However, many studies have examined the effects of adding anticholinergic agents to beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Qureshi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qureshi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brophy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brophy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craven-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Craven 2001</LINK>). Although anticholinergics have a slower onset of action and a weaker bronchodilating effect than beta-2 agonists, they work through different mechanisms and specifically reduce cholinergic broncho motor tone. A systematic review by the Cochrane Airways Group(<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2000</LINK>) reviewed the evidence for a beneficial effect of treating children during acute severe asthma with an anticholinergic agent or both beta-2 agonist and anticholinergic drugs. They concluded that "a single dose of an anticholinergic agent is not effective in the treatment of mild and moderate exacerbations and is insufficient for acute exacerbations. Adding multiple doses of anticholinergics to beta-2 agonists appears safe, improves lung function and would avoid admission in one of eleven such treated patients".</P>
<P>Ipratropium bromide has been used for many years in the treatment of asthma. Use of anticholinergic drugs declined with the development of beta-2 agonists, but interest renewed with the realisation that parasympathetic pathways are important in bronchospasm in some asthmatics. The bronchodilatation produced by ipratropium is slower and less intense than with beta-2 agonists, but effects can last for up to 6 hours. There appears to be variability in the response of asthmatics to ipratropium. This may be related to the amount of parasympathetic tone and to the degree to which reflex activation of cholinergic pathways participate in generating symptoms in individual patients. Therefore, the effects of ipratropium should be monitored on an individual basis.</P>
<P>The British Thoracic Society guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997a</LINK>) recommended that the management of asthma should be a stepwise approach. Ipratropium was recommended for regular maintenance bronchodilator therapy in schoolchildren who are already on high dose inhaled steroids (Step 4). It was not included in the management of asthma in children under the age of 5 years in these guidelines. The British Thoracic Society guidelines have been recently revised (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>) and no longer recommend the use of anticholinergic treatment in chronic asthma in children.</P>

Studies were next assessed independently as included or excluded by two reviewers (NM and AB). Disagreement between the two reviewers was resolved by consensus. A list of excluded studies was also made by the two reviewers (NM and AB) with reasons for their exclusion documented (see Table of Excluded Studies). The following questions were asked of each study:</P>
<P>1) Was the study an RCT?<BR/>2) Was the study carried out in adults or children? Where the study population included both adults and children, the mean age of the population was noted, and authors contacted for the children only data. If no additional data were obtained, and the mean age was between two and eighteen years of age, then the study was included.<BR/>3) Was the study in acute or chronic asthma?<BR/>4) Was the research in exercise-induced asthma?<BR/>5) Was the research a single-dose study?</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-16 09:14:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies to be included underwent quality assessment performed independently by both reviewers (NM and AB), using two methods. The first involved using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation of concealment. Trials were scored using the following principles:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Unclear concealment<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment</P>
<P>Secondly, each study was also assessed using a 1 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1995</LINK> and summarised as follows:</P>
<P>Was the study described as randomised? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the study described as double blind? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the method of randomisation clearly described and appropriate? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (1=yes; 0=no)</P>
<P>One point was deducted if the methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>Any disagreement between the two reviewers regarding the quality scoring was resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-02-16 09:14:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Following the integration of generic inverse variance (GIV) in RevMan 5, we have opted to re-analyse the trial data from crossover studies with this method which analyses studies of that design appropriately. Included trials were combined where possible using Review Manager. For dichotomous variables, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as Odds Ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals. For continuous outcomes, individual and pooled statistics was calculated as Weighted Mean Differences or Standard Mean Differences, as indicated, with 95% Confidence Intervals. A fixed effects model was used to pool the data.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of effect size across pooled studies was calculated, with p &lt; 0.05 used as the cut-off level for significance. The results from parallel studies were not pooled with those from cross-over studies.</P>
<P>It was anticipated that measures of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) such as the provocation dose of a challenge substance (e.g. histamine) required to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD 20) would often be reported as geometric means. Presentation of results in this way indicate that the data has been logarithmically transformed prior to analysis by investigators to take account of skewed distribution. Data from such outcomes could only therefore be pooled across studies if the mean and standard deviation of logged values (from which the geometric means are derived) could be calculated.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-02-17 08:59:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight studies met the inclusion criteria (194 participants). For details of each included study, see 'Characteristics of included studies'. An updated search conducted in February 2010 identified 12 references, none of which met the inclusion criteria. For details of previous searches see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The patients included in these studies were between the ages of 4 and 18 years. A total of 194 patients were included with 97 males and 46 females reported. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1984</LINK> - 49 patients) did not report the numbers of males and females. All participants were studied in the home and outpatient setting.</P>
<P>The studies used a variety of delivery systems (metered dose inhalers with holding chambers and masks, nebulisers and tablets), doses and dosing regimes. Ipratropium bromide, atropine, beta-2 agonists, disodium cromoglycate and placebo were utilised. With one exception, (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK>) ipratropium bromide was the anticholinergic agent.</P>
<P>Asthma severity varied between studies. All patients had chronic asthma, either physician diagnosed or diagnosed according to ATS definitions. In two studies, asthma was described as moderate to severe asthma requiring daily medication (<LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK> included patients with moderate asthma with the majority on daily medication. <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> did not specifically state the asthma severity of the trial patients but all were on daily maintenance treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK> included patients with severe chronic asthma which was inadequately controlled despite maximal daily medication. <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1984</LINK> selected children with mild, moderate and severe asthma. <LINK REF="STD-Raes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raes 1989</LINK> included those with mild chronic symptomatic asthma and <LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1984</LINK> studied those with asymptomatic asthma.</P>
<P>Maintenance treatment included regular inhaled sympathomimetic drugs, disodium cromoglycate, inhaled steroids, oral theophyllines and oral steroids.</P>
<P>Study periods varied from 2 weeks to 4 months. In studies using a cross-over design, a washout period was only described in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> - washout period 4 weeks). In another cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK>), data were analysed only from days 5-14 (out of a trial of 2 x 2 weeks) to provide a wash-out period.</P>
<P>Symptom diaries were recorded in all eight studies. A variety of symptoms were recorded on a daily basis including nocturnal wheeze and cough, daytime wheeze and cough, exercise tolerance, days of school missed and the need for additional medications (e.g. the need for additional courses of oral steroids). In seven studies, daily PEFRs were also recorded; before and after treatment twice daily. Several of the studies attempted to examine the effects of anticholinergic drugs on the diurnal variation in airway calibre seen in children with asthma.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported the validity of their symptom diaries.<BR/>In addition, at certain time points in each study, each patient underwent lung function tests. These were performed in the hospital setting.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:27:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five comparison groups were identified within the studies:</P>
<P>1) Inhaled anticholinergics versus placebo<BR/>2) Inhaled anticholinergics versus beta-2 agonist<BR/>3) Inhaled anticholinergics + beta-2 agonist versus beta-2 agonist<BR/>4) Inhaled anticholinergics versus beta-2 agonist +inhaled anticholinergics<BR/>5) Inhaled anticholinergics versus oral anticholinergics</P>
<P>Ipratropium bromide was the most common anticholinergic drug used but in one trial atropine (inhaled and oral) was used. These results have been analysed separately in two subgroups as it is well recognised that ipratropium bromide is associated with fewer side effects than atropine.</P>
<P>No data could be entered for our primary outcome measure - "days without wheeze or asthma" as none of the studies specifically used this measure, although in some studies it was incorporated into symptom diaries.</P>
<P>1) INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>Three studies could be included within this comparison group. All three studies were cross-over studies. <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> both used IB as the anticholinergic agent. Combining the results of the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> produced a total of 49 patients. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK> used inhaled atropine as the anticholinergic agent and 12 patients were included in their study. All three studies could be combined in a meta-analysis only for PEFR (am) and PEFR (pm). Two studies could be combined for the outcomes of hospitalisation rates and the need for additional oral steroids. The other results presented are from a single study only.</P>
<P>Data from these three studies produced the following results (see Comparisons and Data):</P>
<P>No statistically significant effect of inhaled anticholinergic therapy compared to placebo was observed for the following outcome measures:</P>
<P>Peak expiratory flow rate (am) - SMD (95%CI) = 0.05 (-0.31, 0.40)</P>
<P>Peak expiratory flow rate (pm) - SMD (95% CI) = 0.02 (-0.33, 0.38)</P>
<P>Hospital admissions - Odds Ratio (95 % CI) = 0.14 ( 0.02, 1.25)</P>
<P>Need for additional oral steroids - Odds Ratio (95% CI) = 0.79 (0.21, 3.03)</P>
<P>Symptom scores from <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK> could not be included in the meta-analysis because data were not available for entry into Review Manager. In this study, daily records were kept of day and night cough and wheeze, scoring zero for no symptoms, one for occasional wheeze and/or cough, two for troublesome wheeze and/or cough, and three for very ill with severe wheeze and /or cough.</P>
<P>The authors reported that symptom scores were significantly lower with IB compared to placebo for both night symptom scores (IB 47.8 % compared with placebo 42.9% with score 1; 15.1% IB compared to 21.8% placebo with score 2; 1% IB compared with 3.1% placebo with score 3) and day symptom scores (51.4% IB compared to 48.8% placebo at score 1; 10.2% IB compared with 16.6% placebo at score 2 and 1.4% IB compared with 3.9% placebo at score 3). No standard deviations were given with these results but a p value of &lt; 0.005 was obtained.</P>
<P>However, there was no significant difference between IB and placebo in the percentage of symptom-free nights or days.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> examined the effect of IB on diurnal variation in airway calibre and also on bronchodilator responsiveness. <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> postulated that the nocturnal exacerbation of asthma might be due to an exaggeration in the diurnal variation in airway calibre and an increase in airway sensitivity. He postulated that by treating this, a reduction in the effects of nocturnal asthma might be obtained. To study this, PEFRs were recorded twice daily. In addition, the diurnal variation in bronchodilator responsiveness was assessed by examining the increase in PEFR after salbutamol.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> found that 74% of his subjects recorded significant diurnal variation in PEFR during the baseline period of this study. Treatment with IB did not have an effect on this diurnal variation. 21 out of the 31 patients inhaled three times daily salbutamol. The study initially proposed that all trial patients should take regular salbutamol. However, the reasons for 10 patients not taking salbutamol were not given. An increase in morning PEFRs was observed in 12 out of 21 patients (i.e. 57%) but this increase was not affected by treatment with IB compared to placebo.</P>
<P>The study period in this trial was four periods each lasting four weeks (a baseline period and two treatment periods separated by a washout period). At the end of each study period histamine challenges were performed. Subjects did not use salbutamol or treatment aerosols for between 8 and 12 hours before the challenge test. The provocation dose of histamine needed to cause a fall of 20% in FEV1 (PD 20) was recorded. It was found that treatment with IB was associated with significantly higher mean PD 20 values (geometric mean 0.78 versus 0.49 mg/ml, P&lt;0.01).</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK> was the only trial within this comparison group where the effects of anticholinergic drugs were compared to placebo by using formal lung function testing. Vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/VC, and average forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of the vital capacity (FEF 25-75%) were calculated. In addition, residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) were calculated. Results were expressed as percentages of predicted values for FEV1, FEV1/VC, FEF 25-75% and RV.<BR/>As mentioned above, inhaled atropine did not have an effect on lung function testing. However, the use of oral atropine resulted in significantly higher results (p&lt;0.05) for FEV1/VC and a significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) in RV/VC (see below).<BR/>However, there were no differences between oral atropine, inhaled atropine or placebo for the number of days of school missed, night time waking, the need for additional oral steroids, or morning and evening PEFRs. (see also Comparison of Inhaled anticholinergics versus oral anticholinergics).</P>
<P>2) INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS versus BETA-2 AGONIST</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raes 1989</LINK> compared the effects of IB with the beta-2 agonist, fenoterol, on bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) to histamine. Their study group was in children with mild stable asthma. Daily diary cards were kept and lung function was assessed formally at monthly intervals through the study. The authors reported no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of:</P>
<P>- symptom scores of cough, wheeze, number of asthma attacks<BR/>- PEFR diurnal variation<BR/>- FEV1<BR/>- PD 20 values</P>
<P>In the IB group, three of the 12 patients were withdrawn. The exact timing of this withdrawal is not documented by the authors. Two of these patients had an increase in asthma symptoms in the weeks prior to entering the study and the third patient's symptoms worsened during the study (in all patients in the trial, medications apart from trial drugs had been stopped one week before the start of the study).</P>
<P>3) INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS PLUS BETA-2 AGONISTS versus BETA-2 AGONISTS</P>
<P>Two trials compared the effects of inhaled anticholinergic drugs combined with a beta-2 agonist with a beta-2 agonist alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK>). Unfortunately data could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to data presentation in the <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK> study. Both trials were cross-over studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK> studied 13 children in a two-part study, the second part being relevant to this review. The authors reported that there was no statistically significant difference in symptom scores (recording daytime breathlessness, cough, physical activity, tremor, palpitations and sleep) between the two comparison groups except for a slightly higher score for disturbed sleep during the IB period (p &lt; 0.05). The number of additional doses of salbutamol used were not significantly different between the two groups. The authors also reported that there was no statistically significant difference in the changes in PEFRs or in FEV1 between the two comparison groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK> studied 10 children in a two-part study, the second part being relevant to this review. Once again, the authors reported no statistically significant differences in symptom scores (recording nocturnal wheeze and cough, daytime wheeze, daytime activity and sputum production) between the two study groups. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in PEFRs, which were recorded twice daily. The authors did not examine the effect of trial drugs on diurnal variation. At three time points in the study, lung function tests were performed and results compared to those found at the baseline point in the study. No statistically different changes in lung function (as measured by FEV1, FVC, FEF 25-75% and heart rate) were found between the two study groups.</P>
<P>In summary, both trials failed to show any significant benefit from the long term use of combined anticholinergics with beta-2 agonists compared with beta-2 agonists alone.</P>
<P>4) INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS PLUS BETA-2 AGONISTS versus INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1984</LINK> involved 39 children over a two week study period in a parallel trial. Children were either given fenoterol plus IB or IB alone. However, the dose of IB in the IB alone arm of the study was 5 times that of the dose in the combination arm, making data comparison difficult.</P>
<P>Results were reported by using means but no standard deviations were given. Data could therefore not be entered into the RevMan statistical software package. No tests for significance were calculated by the authors and the baseline data of the two groups were different. Therefore the results from this study will not be reported further. Despite diary cards for symptom scores being recorded by the patients, the results of these were not given in the text.</P>
<P>5) INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS versus ORAL ANTICHOLINERGICS</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK> has already been discussed in the comparison above, "Inhaled anticholinergics versus placebo". This trial compared the effects of both inhaled and oral anticholinergics with placebo on chronic asthma in 12 children. The authors reported no statistically significant differences between any of the three study groups in terms of the number of days missed from school, night time waking, the subjective assessment of adequate asthma control or the need for additional doses of oral steroids. In addition, no significant difference in morning and evening PEFRs between the three groups was noted. The effects on diurnal variation were not examined in the trial. The authors reported a significantly higher FEV1 / VC ratio (p&lt; 0.05) while subjects were taking oral atropine. In addition, the residual volume expressed as a percentage of total lung capacity (RV / TLC) was significantly reduced with oral atropine. Inhaled atropine was not found to be significantly different to placebo.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1984</LINK>, has not been included in the results section above. The trial was a two-part parallel study, the second part of which was relevant to this review. The first part examined and compared the effects of disodium cromoglycate, salbutamol and IB on exercise-induced bronchospasm in 49 patients. 32 patients were then given the trial medications for one month and then reassessed. Outcome measures included symptom diaries, PEFRs and formal lung function (including FEV1) testing at the end of the trial. The study was published in Spanish but a translation was obtained. Unfortunately, the results section of the paper concentrated on reporting the results from the initial phase of the study. No results were given for symptom diaries, PEFRS or FEV1. In addition, the authors did not explain why only 32 of the original 49 patients continued into the second phase of the trial. The study authors have been contacted to obtain more information and their response is awaited.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity</P>
<P>Data were merged from the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK> so these were examined for heterogeneity for treatment setting and asthma severity. In all three studies, the trial settings were similar in that all patients were assessed in both the home and in the outpatient clinic. The three studies were then examined for heterogeneity in asthma severity. In Hutchinson, patients were included with severe chronic asthma. Patients were all said to be inadequately controlled despite maximal daily medication, including regular inhaled sympathomimetics, oral theophylline and inhaled and oral steroids. Mann enrolled patients with chronic asthma who were all on regular daily medication, although none were on oral steroids. Sly did not specifically state the asthma severity of their trial group but all children were on salbutamol, oral theophyllines and inhaled steroids, suggesting at least moderate asthma. The PEFR data analysed in the meta-analysis from these three studies showed no evidence of heterogeneity (chi square = 0.23, p = 0.89), and was therefore not explored further.</P>
<P>The existence of publication bias would have been assessed by using a funnel plot. However, as only three studies could be merged these data were considered insufficient to examine for this. However, in future updates of this review, if more data can be merged then the presence of publication bias will be sought.</P>
<P>Mann was graded A by the Cochrane assessment of allocation of concealment, whereas the other seven trials scored B. Where data from three trials were compared (<LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK>), similar results were found. So, although a formal sensitivity analysis could not be performed due to the low numbers, it was encouraging that similar data were found when trials of different allocation concealment were compared.</P>
<P>Secondly, each study was also assessed using a 1 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1995</LINK> as discussed above. One trial obtained a Jadad score of 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK>); four trials obtained a score of 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Mann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK>) and three studies a score of 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1984</LINK>). However, despite the variation in trial quality, once again when data were compared between studies, findings were similar, suggesting that trial quality did not affect the findings of the review.</P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS AND EFFECTS</P>
<P>Very few adverse events or side effects were reported in any of the trials. Mann reported no apparent side effects but one child disliked the taste of IB. Sly did not discuss or monitor side effects. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1980</LINK> reported no side effects for either inhaled or oral atropine. They did report however, that if they increased the dose of oral atropine, a small increase in their selected dose caused dry mouth and mydriasis. <LINK REF="STD-Bratteby-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bratteby 1986</LINK> reported mild tremor and palpitations in both their treatment groups (i.e. IB plus beta-2 agonists and beta-2 agonists alone). <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1984</LINK> reported cough occurring in seven children in both treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Raes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raes 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1984</LINK> reported no side effects during their study period.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Anticholinergic agents are widely used in the treatment of acute asthma and in infants with airways obstruction with associated wheeze. A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2000</LINK>) concluded that using multiple doses of anticholinergic in addition to beta-2 agonists was beneficial in the management of acute asthma in children. It is also well recognised that a single dose of anticholinergic has bronchodilating effects although the effect may be slightly less and slower in onset of action than with beta-2 agonists. However, the effectiveness of anticholinergics as part of the regular maintenance treatment in chronic asthma remains unclear, resulting in the need for this review. </P>
<P>Despite an extensive and thorough literature search in which hundreds of papers examining anticholinergic drugs were found, only eight met the inclusion criteria of this review. Three papers compared the effects of anticholinergic drugs with placebo, and a meta-analysis of these results demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of the use of anticholinergic drugs over placebo in any of the outcome measures (including symptom scores, PEFRs and formal lung function testing). The results of one trial could not be included in the meta-analysis but the authors did report significantly lower symptom scores with inhaled anticholinergics compared with placebo. However, there was no significant difference between IB and placebo in the percentage of symptom-free nights or days.</P>
<P>Two trials studied the effects of anticholinergics on bronchial hyper responsiveness to histamine, by measuring the provocation dose of histamine needed to cause a fall of 20 % in FEV1 (PD 20). One study (comparing anticholinergics with placebo) reported a statistically significant increase in PD 20 but this was not found in another study (comparing anticholinergics with beta-2 agonist). A meta-analysis could not be performed to view the overall effect as the comparison groups were different.</P>
<P>Both of these trials also examined the effect of anticholinergic drugs on diurnal variation in PEFR and both reported no effect.</P>
<P>Two studies compared the addition of an anticholinergic drug to a beta-2 agonist with a beta-2 agonist alone. Although the results could not be combined in a meta-analysis, both trials failed to show any significant benefit from the long term use of combined anticholinergics with beta-2 agonists compared with beta-2 agonists alone (symptom scores, PEFRs and lung function tests were used as outcome measures). </P>
<P>One trial compared the effects of oral and inhaled anticholinergic drugs with placebo. No statistically significant differences were found in any of the outcome measures except for a higher FEV1 / VC ratio and RV / TLC ratio (i.e. reduced "gas-trapping") with oral anticholinergic therapy when compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Two non-English language trials were included in our review. Unfortunately, data reporting in these papers was poor so conclusions are difficult to draw from these trials. In addition, the IB doses in the two arms of the <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1984</LINK> study were different and therefore, comparison could not be made.</P>
<P>It was noted that three out of the five cross-over studies did not incorporate a formal wash-out period. However, we think that this is unlikely to have affected the study results as inhaled anticholinergic drugs are known to have a relatively short duration of action.</P>
<P>The present review summarises the best evidence available to date. Although there were some small beneficial findings in favour of anticholinergic therapy as detailed above, the results presented here do not support the use of anticholinergic drugs in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children. Further work is required to clarify their exact role if any.</P>
<P>The British Thoracic Society guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997a</LINK>) recommended the use of IB as regular maintenance therapy in schoolchildren who are already on high dose inhaled steroids (Step 4). They were not recommended for use in the management of chronic asthma in children under the age of 5 years. The new BTS/SIGN guidelines have recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). From this review, it seems that there is little evidence to support their use for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children, and this is reflected in the new guidelines that withdrawn the previous recommendation.</P>
<P>METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS</P>
<P>Systematic bias <BR/>Bias related to missed trials: a large volume of literature was searched for relevant studies. Despite a comprehensive search strategy it is possible that relevant studies were missed.</P>
<P>Power<BR/>A significant proportion of outcome data from individual trials could not be included in the meta-analysis because either standard deviation values for mean effect sizes were not presented in the original citation or no numerical data were presented at all. These missing data will diminish the power of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Generalisability<BR/>The studies included in this review included children with a spectrum of asthma severity being treated with a range of drug doses delivered by various means (nebuliser, MDI, MDI plus spacer) over a range of treatment periods. These factors should be taken into account when considering the findings of this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children with chronic asthma (ranging in severity from mild to severe), there is not enough data to assess the efficacy of adding long term anticholinergic therapy to maintenance treatment. </P>
<P>It does however appear that anticholinergic agents are safe and well tolerated. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials could improve on several aspects: interventions, choice of outcomes, and stratified reporting of results by asthma severity level.<BR/> <BR/>Several of the trials that were included in this review discussed the uncertainty about selecting appropriate doses and delivery methods of anticholinergic drugs. A variety of doses were therefore selected and drugs were delivered by a variety of delivery systems. In some of the trials, it was unclear how the drug had been delivered and if by inhaler +/- holding chamber, whether the inhaler technique had been checked. </P>
<P>It is clearly difficult to monitor the effects of the trial drug on a child's quality of life and asthma control over a long period of time when the child is at home. Completing symptom and PEFR diaries is time consuming and results are difficult to validate. Future trials should include more sensitive and reliable endpoints and should perhaps consider the use of researchers in the community environment to monitor outcome measures. When children are assessed in the hospital environment for formal lung function testing, a wider and more consistent choice of outcome measures would help to compare results from a number of studies.</P>
<P>Finally, the small number of trials found during this review meant that results could not be separated meaningfully with regard to asthma severity. This may be important and should be considered if further trials are planned.</P>

<P>References identified: 438 titles and abstracts<BR/>Possibly relevant: 107 studies for inclusion. Full text versions of these papers were obtained &amp; assessed independently by NM and AB. Where a query arose about a study's fulfilment of the inclusion criteria, the authors were contacted for further confirmation. If the trial had presented both child and adult data together, authors were asked if they could provide the data for children separately. No further information was provided by study authors.<BR/>N included: Eight. All study authors contacted to clarify information.<BR/>N excluded: 99 papers (reasons for exclusion detailed in 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' .<BR/>
<BR/>Nine out of the 107 studies were published in a foreign language (one in French, one in Polish, three in Spanish, two in Italian, one in German, and one in Dutch). No study was excluded on the basis of language of publication. Translations have been obtained for all studies. Two non-English language papers met the inclusion criteria for this review and were included (Vazquez 1984; Zimmermann 1984).</P>
