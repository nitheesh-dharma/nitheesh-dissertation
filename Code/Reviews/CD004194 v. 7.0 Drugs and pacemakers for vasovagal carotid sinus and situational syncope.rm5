<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-05 21:15:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neurally mediated reflex syncope (including fainting) is the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness. It is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure and/or lowering of heart rate. The main treatment goal therefore is to increase blood pressure and heart rate. In most patients, this can be achieved by non-pharmacological treatment measures (e.g. adequate fluid and salt intake, physical counterpressure manoeuvres). In patients not responding to this treatment, pharmacological or pacemaker treatment might be considered. We investigated the effectiveness of these treatments for different subtypes of neurally mediated reflex syncope, namely vasovagal syncope (fainting), carotid sinus syncope (fainting due to pressure on the neck) and situational syncope (fainting when passing urine of faeces or swallowing). Where data were available, we determined the treatment effectiveness for different outcome measures including occurrence of syncope, amount of (pre-)syncopes per year during follow-up and quality of life.</P>
<P>We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope. No studies on situational syncope matched the criteria for inclusion in our review. Studies in general were small with a median size of 42 patients. A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using placebo control treatment. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. The type of outcomes reported by studies varied considerably with only 16 studies reporting on non-provoked recurrences during follow-up. As a consequence of all these differences, results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. In some studies significant results were reported for one type of outcome, but not for other outcomes.</P>
<P>We conclude that there is insufficient evidence either to support or to<SUP> </SUP>refute the use of any of the pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-08 12:27:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In neurally mediated reflex syncope a reflex is triggered that induces vasodilatation and/or bradycardia, resulting in a systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). It is by far the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness both in general practice and in clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Colman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soteriades-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soteriades 2002</LINK>). The three main types of neurally mediated reflex syncope are vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syncope and situational syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vasovagal syncope is characterised by premonitory signs and provoked by triggering events such as prolonged standing, emotion or pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). Carotid sinus syncope is caused by stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors, which may lead to hypotension or bradycardia or both. Situational syncope is defined as loss of consciousness at the onset of, during or directly after swallowing, defecation, micturition or coughing.</P>
<P>The life-time prevalence of neurally mediated reflex syncope in the general population ranges between 30 and 50% for people up to 60 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ganzeboom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganzeboom 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganzeboom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganzeboom 2006</LINK>). Vasovagal syncope accounts for the vast majority (75%) of episodes of reflex syncope in patients under 60 years of age that come to medical attention (<LINK REF="REF-Linzer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linzer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2008</LINK>). Twenty-one percent of reflex syncopal episodes are caused by situational syncope and about 4% by carotid sinus syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Linzer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linzer 1997</LINK>). Although the prognosis of neurally mediated reflex syncope is usually benign, it can be disabling and have a profound effect on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of neurally mediated reflex syncope is aimed at ensuring an adequate blood supply to the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). Treatments options might however vary considerably among different types of neurally mediated reflex syncope. Most patients with a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and situational syncope can be treated by counselling and advice. Avoiding or ameliorating the triggering event is a crucial treatment component for situational syncope, but is also applicable to patients with vasovagal syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wieling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieling 2004</LINK>). For both conditions, recognition of premonitory signs are also important as well as increasing fluid and salt intake (<LINK REF="REF-Wieling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieling 2004</LINK>). Patients with recognizable premonitory signs and symptoms are instructed to apply counterpressure manoeuvres (e.g. leg-crossing, muscle-tensing) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2006b</LINK>). Tilt-training has been put forward to prevent the recurrence of neurally mediated syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Ector-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ector 1998</LINK>). Recent studies indicate that this intervention might only be effective in highly motivated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Foglia_x002d_Manzillo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foglia-Manzillo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurevitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurevitz 2007</LINK>), limiting widespread use of this intervention.</P>
<P>The treatment of carotid sinus syncope depends upon the nature of its condition (<LINK REF="REF-Healey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healey 2004</LINK>). Pharmacological treatment is advocated for the vasodepressor form; pacemaker treatment for mixed and bradycardic forms. Pharmacological and pacemaker treatment can also be considered for vasovagal syncope and situational syncope upon failure of the aforementioned non-pharmacological treatment measures (<LINK REF="REF-Brignole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignole 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many pharmacological interventions have been proposed for treating neurally mediated reflex syncope but the evidence to suggest their effectiveness is limited to small studies, sometimes showing conflicting results. Medications used to prevent syncope include beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g. etilephrine, midodrine), ACE-inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, anti-arrhythmic agents (e.g. disopyramide), serotonine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine) and medication for fluid retention, such as salt tablets and fludrocortisone (<LINK REF="REF-Benditt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benditt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calkins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calkins 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). The (presumed) mechanisms of actions of these pharmacological agents are discussed below (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). Since it is unknown whether salt tablets are effective to prevent neurally-mediated reflex syncope in addition to changes in lifestyle, we considered salt tablets as pharmacological treatment in our review.</P>
<P>Pacemakers are also sometimes used in cases of neurally mediated reflex syncope with severe bradycardia or asystole (<LINK REF="REF-Kuriachan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuriachan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from the clinical effectiveness, it is also important to address the issue of cost-effectiveness of pharmacological and pacemaker treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope. In the Netherlands, the average treatment costs per year vary between EUR 6 and 2614 (USD 8 and 3570) for the suggested pharmacological treatment measures (<LINK REF="REF-College-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">College 2009</LINK>). The costs associated with the implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker system are about EUR 1145 (USD1560) per year. Costs might however vary considerably across countries and types of health care systems.</P>
<P>Though pharmacological and pacemaker treatment are frequently prescribed to large numbers of patients suffering from recurrent neurally-mediated reflex syncope, little is known about the clinical effectiveness of these expensive treatments. Therefore, the aim of this review was to determine the effects of both pharmacotherapy and pacemaker therapy in patients with different forms of neurally mediated reflex syncope.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-08 12:27:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many pharmacological and pacemaker interventions have been implemented in clinical practice in order to reduce (pre-)syncopal recurrence in patients with neurally mediated reflex syncope. Though here is much debate on the effectiveness of these interventions, a systematic review has not been forthcoming. This Cochrane systematic review presents evidence which may help facilitate decision making for physicians and other health care workers involved in treating patients with neurally mediated reflex syncope. Moreover, it might lead to the development of new and better studies aiming to improve treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope.</P>

<P>The following drugs were considered for inclusion in our review: beta-blockers (both selective and non-selective), fludrocortisone, alpha-adrenergic agonists, selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), ACE-inhibitors, disopyramide, anticholinergic agents and salt tablets. The presumed mechanisms of action of these pharmacological interventions are stated in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>Pacemaker therapy is hypothesized to counteract the cardioinhibitory component of the vasovagal response (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2007</LINK>). There are different types of pacemakers, which can be classified by a three-letter abbreviation (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2002</LINK>). The first letter stands for the heart chambers paced (Atrial, Ventrical, Dual), the second for the heart chambers sensed (Atrial, Ventrical, Dual, or none (O)), the third for the response (Inhibited, Triggered, Dual (I and T) or none (O)). Sometimes a fourth letter is added to denote the presence or absence of rate modulation.</P>
<P>In this review, we included all different types of dual-chamber cardiac pacemakers, either with or without rate hysteresis, or rate drop response sensing, provided that a comparison was made with no therapy or counselling and advice or pharmacotherapy, another type of pacemaker therapy or with pacemaker &#8216;off&#8217;.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-09-01 12:02:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>Since the aetiology of the different subtypes of neurally mediated reflex syncope is quite different (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>), we presented the studies for vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syncope and situational syncope in different sections. Within these sections, studies were categorized by pharmacological or pacemaker treatment modality. Next, for each treatment modality, studies were classified depending on the type of control treatment. Thus, all studies were classified at three levels: 1) subtype of neurally mediated reflex syncope, 2) pharmacological or pacemaker treatment modality, 3) treatment comparison.</P>
<P>Next, for each study, summary estimates of treatment effect (with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)) were calculated for each outcome measure provided that study data were available for a particular treatment comparison. For dichotomous outcomes risk ratios (RR) were calculated. For continuous outcomes we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) or weighted standardised mean difference (SMD), when appropriate. For data with discrete numbers we determined the rate ratio by dividing the mean number of syncopal episodes by the number of person years of follow-up. For time-to-event data we calculated the hazard ratio with the help of the P value of the log rank statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to combine a continuous outcome measure of included parallel and cross-over studies we determined the WMD as described by Curtin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>). For the pooling of a dichotomous outcome measure from studies with and without a cross-over design we calculated a combined odds ratio (OR) according to the Becker-Balagtas method (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). In case the results of cross-over trials were presented as in parallel studies and no additional information was provided by contacting the corresponding authors of these studies, we assumed that there was no correlation between observations on the same patient. This means that such studies received less weight in the analyses because the effect estimate would have been more precise in case of a positive correlation.</P>
<P>Results of clinically and statistically homogeneous studies (i.e. studies for which the participants, interventions, outcome measures and timing of the follow-up measurements were considered to be similar) were combined using a fixed effect model. In case of statistical heterogeneity (as assessed by visual inspection of the forest plots, the Q-statistic and the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>)) and the availability of at least five studies, a random effects model was used.

<P>If results of two or more studies were available for a particular outcome measure, we presented the results of parallel and cross-over studies in different subgroups.

<P>Data were extracted from 43 of the 46 included studies. 2327 Patients participated in these remaining 43 studies. The trial sizes in the different studies ranged from 8 to 208 participants with a median sample size of 48 (interquartile range 25 to 65). The mean age of patients within these trials was 49.8 years of age (range 13 to 86). On average, 45% of the study participants were men. The studies were undertaken between 1992 and 2006, mainly in developed countries. As far as the duration of the wash-out period was reported in cross-over trials, it varied between 1 to 2 hours to 7 days.

Though dual chamber pacemakers were used in all these studies, the precise pacemaker responses differed between studies. Both rate drop responsiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1999</LINK>) and DDI-pacing with rate hysteresis (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>) were applied. In one of these studies, the action made has not been specified (<LINK REF="STD-Flammang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Flammang 1999</LINK>). The occurrence of syncope during follow-up was found to be lower in patients treated with a DDI-pacemaker compared to patients receiving standard treatment (risk ratio 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 - 0.60)(see<I> </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>)(<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>).

<P>Active DDD-pacemaker treatment was compared with non-active pacemaker treatment in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Connolly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Bedawi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">El-Bedawi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raviele-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raviele 2004</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-05 21:41:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we studied different pharmacological and pacemaker treatments for various types of reflex syncope. We identified randomized trials for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope, but were unable to include any studies about situational syncope. In the following sections, we discuss the different treatment modalities for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Vasovagal syncope</HEADING>
<P>There is no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope.</P>
<P>In individual studies, we found significant effects for beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and anticholinergic agents for the outcome occurrence of syncope upon provocational head-up tilt testing (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, this outcome should be interpreted with caution, because the reproducibility of tilt test results could vary between 31% and 94% depending on the tilt test response (<LINK REF="REF-Brignole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignole 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanc-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 1992</LINK>). Approximately 50% of patients with a baseline positive tilt test become negative upon repeat of the tilt test (<LINK REF="REF-Brignole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignole 2004</LINK>). Moreover, provocational tilt testing does not provide information about the ability of interventions to prevent (pre-)syncopal recurrence in daily life (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). For all studies in which any treatment was initiated only upon symptom recurrence during a provocational head-up tilt test we obtained significant differences (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, pre-syncope, which is associated with a blood pressure decrement (<LINK REF="REF-Alboni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alboni 2002</LINK>), was already imminent in these patients. Because of this, comparison with patients with treatment initiation before the occurrence of transient loss of consciousness is difficult. The results of studies in which the effectiveness of treatment is determined by provocational head-up tilt testing need therefore to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>For DDD-pacemaker treatment compared to standard treatment in unblinded studies we found significant effects regarding the occurrence of syncope and time to syncopal recurrence (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, no significant differences for these parameters were observed when active DDD-pacemaker treatment was compared with inactive pacemaker treatment. These findings strongly suggest that the primary mechanism of benefit of pacemaker insertion is an expectation response, rather than a true treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2007</LINK>). Adequate blinding is undoubtedly necessary to observe true effects of pacemaker interventions.</P>
<P>DDD-pacemakers were more effective than DDI-pacemakers with respect to the occurrence of syncope during follow-up and the time to first syncopal recurrence (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, all three studies were very small and firm recommendations can not be based on this body of evidence.</P>
<P>Though treatment with fludrocortisone is considered to be a useful treatment option for vasovagal syncope, we did not include any studies evaluating the effectiveness of fludrocortisone, because no controlled studies with adult patients were available (<LINK REF="REF-Kuriachan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuriachan 2008</LINK>). A relatively small controlled trial in children found that symptoms disappeared more often in patients treated with fludrocortisone than in patients receiving placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Salim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salim 2005</LINK>). A study evaluating the tolerance of fludrocortisone in elderly patients also found that side effects were common upon treatment with fludrocortisone (<LINK REF="REF-Hussain-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussain 1996</LINK>). The results from these studies indicate that fludrocortisone can not be considered the treatment of choice in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-09-05 21:41:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite a reasonable number of trials in our review, many uncertainties remain. The main reasons for this incomplete picture are that studies are small in sample size, use a variety of control treatments, are often not blinded, and the focus is not always on patient relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>In syncope trials, there is no agreement on the most relevant treatment outcomes. Therefore, many different outcomes are reported in the included studies of our review, which could result in outcome measures contradicting each other.This makes it very difficult to make clear statements about the effectiveness of particular pharmacological or pacemaker interventions. Multiple studies have used laboratory testing (head-up tilt test) as a surrogate end-point for clinical effectiveness. Studies however have shown that laboratory responses and responses in daily life are significantly different (<LINK REF="REF-Brignole-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignole 2006b</LINK>). Head-up tilt testing may therefore be used for preliminary assessment of effectiveness, but for assessment of true effectiveness of interventions studies using clinical outcomes are needed.</P>
<P>In trials, selective dropout, cross-over and loss to follow-up have a negative impact upon the comparability of different treatment groups. Comparability of different treatment groups is important in order to determine pure treatment effects of interventions. An intention-to-treat is more appropriate to clinical practice, since any selective dropout, cross-over or loss to follow-up is taken into account in this analysis. For this reason, we preferred to extract data according to an intention-to-treat analysis in this review.</P>
<P>Effective treatment for neurally mediated syncope not only reduces the recurrence of syncope and pre-syncope, but also makes patients <I>feel</I> better. It is well known that quality of life is decreased in patients with transient loss of consciousness compared to patients without syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Linzer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linzer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2007</LINK>). In previous studies, quality of life appeared to be lower in patients with frequent recurrences of transient loss of consciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2006a</LINK>). Recurrent episodes were found to be the strongest negative predictor of quality of life in patients with transient loss of consciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2007</LINK>). Because of this, improving quality of life is an important goal of treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope. Unfortunately, quality of life was only addressed in a limited number of included studies.</P>
<P>In this review, we have not investigated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological and pacemaker treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope. As some of these treatments are quite expensive (<LINK REF="REF-College-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">College 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deniz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deniz 2008</LINK>), costs of treatment need to be considered prior to treatment initiation. None of the pharmacological and pacemaker treatments investigated in this review showed clear superiority to control treatment for different treatment comparisons. Therefore, these treatments should only be applied to patients with frequent (pre-)syncopal recurrences, unresponsive to non-pharmacological treatment. Based on the results from our review, widespread usage of pharmacological and pacemaker treatment for neurally-mediated reflex syncope is not likely to produce a significant increase in patients' well-being and is in our view therefore not a cost-effective option.</P>
<P>Non-pharmacological treatment measures such as ensuring an adequate fluid and salt intake, regular exercise and the performance of physical counterpressure manoeuvres have been shown to be effective, initial treatment measures for vasovagal syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wieling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieling 2004</LINK>). For this reason, non-pharmacological treatment is currently recommended to all patients diagnosed with neurally mediated reflex syncope in current syncope management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 2009</LINK>). Since non-pharmacological treatment measures are especially useful to increase the circulating blood volume (<LINK REF="REF-Wieling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieling 2004</LINK>), patients with cardio-inhibitory carotid sinus syncope seem to be less likely to benefit from these measures. Except maybe for these patients, pharmacological or pacemaker treatment should only be considered in patients failing to respond to non-pharmacological treatment measures. However, in all studies included in our review, pharmacological and/or pacemaker treatment were prescribed without prior non-pharmacological treatment. Treatment effects could be much different in patients not responding to non-pharmacological treatment measures. Therefore, the fact that the effectiveness of pharmacological and pacemaker treatment in included studies has not been determined in patients not responding to non-pharmacological treatment measures could seriously impair the applicability of study results to clinical practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-09-01 12:21:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>Since it has been found that patients more often present themselves after a recent worsening of their symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 2007</LINK>), it is likely that syncopal recurrence will decrease during treatment regardless of the prescribed intervention. Therefore, treatment effects for neurally mediated reflex syncope are partly due to a natural decrease in syncopal recurrence. By comparing one particular treatment with an adequate control treatment it is still possible to determine whether particular treatments are effective.</P>
<P>We included 13 cross-over studies in our review. Cross-over studies have the advantage that treatments effects are based on comparison within individuals. This can lead to an increased precision meaning that confidence intervals become smaller in cross-over trials compared to parallel studies if outcomes are positively correlated. Unfortunately, the majority of cross-over studies in our review (11 out of 13) did not report on this correlation. Unfortunately, we were unable to retrieve this information by contacting the authors of the original publications. In these studies we assumed that correlation would be zero. This is a conservative approach meaning that the weight of those studies could have been larger if they had used or reported this information. We performed two additional sensitivity analyses to examine whether alternative approaches would have changed the results. In one sensitivity analysis, we imputed the average correlation reported in other cross-over studies. In the other sensitivity analysis we set the correlation to zero in all cross-over studies. Both sensitivity analyses produced nearly identical results as our main analysis (data not shown). </P>
<P>A major drawback of cross-over studies arises when carry-over effects are present (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). This means that the size of treatment effect is different when a treatment is given as first compared to second. This greatly reduces the informativeness of cross-over trials. None of our cross-over studies examined the presence of carry-over effects or would have sufficient power to examine it in a meaningful way. The implicit assumption in our review is therefore that the impact of carry-over effects is limited.</P>
<P>In 27 of the 46 included studies (59%) the randomization method was described in insufficient detail to make a judgement. Moreover in 80% of studies, the treatment allocation was not concealed or inadequately concealed. Because of this, there might have been systematic differences between the groups being compared. In other words, selection bias might have occurred.</P>
<P>In more than 20% (10/46) of the studies included in this review, patients, physicians, and other study personnel were not blinded. Blinding is difficult in studies comparing pharmacological treatment with pacemaker treatment. The lack of blinding of treatments almost certainly influenced our results. This is illustrated by the fact that pacemaker treatment was found to be more effective than standard treatment for vasovagal syncope (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, active pacemaker treatment was not superior to non-active pacemaker treatment. In unblinded studies, systematic differences between treatment groups in the care that is provided, or in exposure to factors other than the interventions of interest (e.g. an expectation effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2007</LINK>)) might have occurred. Also, systematic differences between groups might have occurred with respect to the withdrawals from a study (attrition bias) and also in the manners of outcome assessment (detection bias). Thus, the lack of blinding in many of the studies in our review could have caused serious bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-07 22:09:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joost Romme">
<P>We made comparisons for certain groups of different pharmacological agents (e.g. beta-blockers). In principle, we assumed that the treatment effect of all pharmacological agents within a certain pharmacological group was similar. If the treatment effects of different agents within a certain pharmacological group differ considerably, the general treatment effect might be insignificant, while the treatment effects of certain pharmacological agents can be significant. Except for alpha-adrenergic agents for vasovagal syncope, we did not find clear indications for specific treatment effects within a certain pharmacological group.</P>
<P>For different comparisons of pharmacological treatment, the dosage of pharmacological treatment could differ considerably between studies. This could influence the occurrence of syncope and side effects due to dose-effect relationships. Only if more studies would have been available, the effects for certain medication dosages could have been investigated separately. Because of the limited amount of studies we obtained, we decided to analyze the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment independent of the drug dosage in order to be able to draw some conclusions from the available studies.</P>

<P>Current evidence does not support pharmacological treatment or pacemaker implantation in patients with vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope.</P>
<P>We were unable to include any studies about situational syncope, and therefore cannot make any recommendations for this subdiagnosis of neurally mediated reflex syncope.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-08 12:37:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For most patients with neurally mediated reflex syncope, pharmacological and pacemaker treatment are only relevant treatment options upon failure of non-pharmacological treatment measures. However, in none of the studies included in this review treatment effects were determined in patients who failed to respond to non-pharmacological treatment. Therefore, in future studies, the effectiveness of pharmacological and pacemaker treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope should be determined in patients with an insufficient response to non-pharmacological treatment, especially in patients with vasovagal syncope and situational syncope. Non-pharmacological treatment measures aimed at ensuring adequate blood supply to the brain are probably less appropriate to patients with cardio-inhibitory carotid sinus syncope.</P>
<P>No studies on situational syncope were included in this review. Also, we did not include any RCT studying the effectiveness of fludrocortisone treatment, though this pharmacological treatment is prescribed often in clinical practice. For almost all other kinds of pharmacological and pacemaker treatments, the number of studies and included patients was very limited. Often, a comparison with placebo or standard treatment was not made. We hope that the above information encourages researchers to address these issues in future studies.</P>
<P>Preferably, double-blinded randomized controlled trials should be performed. For future research, it is important to select outcome measures that are directly relevant to patients. In many studies included in our review, provocational head-up tilt testing was used to determine the effectiveness of treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope. However, in daily life, syncopal episodes do not occur while standing upon a tilt table. Because of this, the occurrence of syncope during long-term follow-up is a much better indicator of treatment effectiveness in daily life.</P>
<P>Additionally, quality of life needs to be assessed, because an inverse association exists between recurrence of transient loss of consciousness and quality of life. Preferably, both generic quality of life and syncope-related quality of life should be addressed. Information about the occurrence of side effects is an important factor in the decision whether or not to prescribe pharmacological or pacemaker treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope. Therefore, the occurrence of side effects should be determined in future studies. In case of study drop out or loss of follow-up, an intention-to-treat-analysis is preferable to determine pure treatment effects.</P>
<P>Therefore, we hope that the occurrence of syncope during follow-up, quality of life and the occurrence of side effects will be addressed in future studies on the effectiveness of pharmacological or pacemaker treatment for neurally mediated reflex syncope in patients not responding to initial, non-pharmacological treatment.</P>

<P>The title of the protocol to this review was Drugs and pacemakers for neurally mediated reflex syncope. The title has changed from protocol to review. In the new title (Drugs and pacemakers for vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syncope and situational syncope) the subtypes of neurally mediated reflex syncope that we investigated are indicated specifically. </P>
<P>In the protocol, we indicated that we would include randomized or quasi-randomized parallel randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and cross-over trials in our review. In practice, we have only included parallel randomized controlled trials and randomized cross-over trials in our review because of the tremendous amount of publications we obtained in the first selection of articles.</P>
<P>In the protocol of this review it was stated that summary estimates of treatment effect (relative risk and mean difference) would be calculated for each comparison. However, this was impossible for several studies due to a lack of information. Furthermore, different summary estimates were needed for discrete data (rate ratio) and time-to-event data (hazard ratio). We calculated odds ratios to compare binary outcomes between parallel and cross-over studies.</P>
<P>Due to the fact that we obtained relatively few studies for each comparison, we did not perform analyses for RCTs separately and RCTs and CCTs combined. Instead, we only performed combined analyses for RCTs and CCTs combined according to the methods described by Curtin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>). Because of the lack of relevant studies for each comparison we did not perform a sensitivity analysis. For the same reason, we considered it inappropriate to assess the presence of publication bias using funnel plots.</P>

<P>- The duration of drug testing could vary between patients and could be short (3 days). Thus, it is unclear whether the effects observed during drug testing are real or happened just by chance.</P>
<P>- Chronic treatment with medication was based upon the efficacy of drug testing in patients. This implies that chronic treatment was not really random.</P>
<P>- Elastic compression stockings are reported to be effective in case the drugs patients had received were unsuccessful or caused side effects. It is however unclear which drugs these patients had used.</P>
<P>From the study, it appears that different patients were treated with different dosages of medication for a different duration of time. Because of this, we considered the study results insufficiently valid and applicable for data extraction.</P>

<FOOTNOTE>For this randomized cross-over trial, we presented the number of patients that received the treatment of intervention and control. Patients included in cross-over trials receive both treatments. Thus, the actual number of patients studied in randomized cross-over trials is equal to the number of patients that receive either intervention or control treatment. By contrast, patients included in randomized controlled trials receive either intervention or control treatment. We took the actual number of patients into account when calculating the combined treatment effect for this outcome measure.</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>For this randomized cross-over trial, we presented the number of patients that received the treatment of intervention and control. Patients included in cross-over trials receive both treatments. Thus, the actual number of patients studied in randomized cross-over trials is equal to the number of patients that receive either intervention or control treatment. By contrast, patients included in randomized controlled trials receive either intervention or control treatment. We took the actual number of patients into account when calculating the combined treatment effect for this outcome measure.</FOOTNOTE>

<TD>
<P>Presumed mechanism(s) of action</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Beta-blocker</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>-Beta-blockers decrease the force of ventricular contraction thereby reducing stimulation of ventricular and arterial mechanoreceptors which is hypothesized to induce syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>-Beta-blockers block the sympathic stimulation of the adrenal glands, thereby preventing catecholamine release and subsequent adrenaline induced vasodilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2004</LINK>)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Alpha-adrenergic agonists</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The binding of alpha-adrenergic agonists to receptors of arteriolar and venous vasculature could enhance peripheral vascular tone thereby helping to maintain blood pressure and in this way preventing the occurrence of neurally-mediated reflex syncope (<LINK REF="REF-Brignole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignole 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1995</LINK>).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Selective serotonine re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Blocking re-uptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft, thereby augmenting the extracellular serotonin concentration. This results in a downregulation of post-synaptic serotonin receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Samoil-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samoil 1995</LINK>). Consequently, the surge of cerebral serotonin that occurs prior to syncope is blunted (<LINK REF="REF-Helke-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helke 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1988</LINK>).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The enzyme angiotensin elevates sympathetic tone (<LINK REF="REF-Majewski-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majewski 1984</LINK>). Inhibition of this enzyme with an ACE-inhibitor will therefore reduce sympathetic activity and in this way reduce the contractility of the heart, thereby preventing the syncope reflex to occur (<LINK REF="REF-Zeng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 1998</LINK>).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Disopyramide</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Anti-arrhythmic drug with negative inotropic and anticholinergic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2004</LINK>). These effects could prevent the occurrence of neurally-mediated reflex syncope.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Anticholinergic agents</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Blocking the activity of the nervus vagus with anticholinergic agents could prevent the bradycardia occurring in patients with neurally-mediated reflex syncope (<LINK REF="REF-McLaran-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaran 1986</LINK>).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Salt tablets</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Salt stimulates water retention and thereby increases plasma volume as well as orthostatic tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wieling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieling 2004</LINK>).</P>

<TD>
<P>Fludrocortisone</P>
