<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:07:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>The common cold is probably the most common illness known and usually presents with a range of symptoms such as sore throat, nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing and cough. On average, young children have six to eight colds per year and adults have two to four. It is caused by viruses (more than 200 viruses have been implicated) and is generally not a serious condition which usually resolves by itself within one to two weeks. However, the common cold has a large impact on time lost from work or school and causes substantial discomfort.</P>
<P>As there is no cure for the common cold, only symptomatic treatment is available. Many people use oral over-the-counter (OTC) medications that contain antihistamines, decongestants, analgesics or a combination to self treat the symptoms of the common cold. Our review of 27 trials with over 5000 participants shows some benefit of these treatments in adults and older children with regards to general recovery and symptoms. The combination of antihistamine-decongestant is the most effective combination but many people experience adverse effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, insomnia and dizziness. There is no evidence for a beneficial effect in young children. The included trials studied very different populations, treatments and outcomes but overall the methodological quality was acceptable.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:25:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We included 27 trials (5117 participants) of common cold treatments. Fourteen trials studied antihistamine-decongestant combinations; two antihistamine-analgesic; six analgesic-decongestant; and five antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations. In 21 trials the control intervention was placebo and in six trials an active substance. Reporting of methods in most trials was poor and there were large differences in design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Pooling was only possible for a limited number of studies and outcomes.</P>
<P>
<U>Antihistamine-decongestant:</U> 12 trials. Eight trials report on global effectiveness, six could be pooled; n = 309 on active treatment, n = 312 placebo) the odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.50); the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was four (95% CI 3 to 5.6). On the final evaluation day 41% of participants in the placebo group had a favourable response compared to 66% on active treatment. Of the two trials that were not included in the pooling, one showed some global effect, the other showed no effect.</P>
<P>
<U>Antihistamine-analgesic</U>: three trials. Two reported on global effectiveness, data from one study was presented. (n = 290 on active treatment, n = 292 ascorbic acid). The OR of treatment failure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.46) and the NNTB was 6.67 (95% CI 4.76 to 12.5). After six days of treatment 43% were cured in the control group and 70% in the active treatment group. The second study also showed an effect in favour of active treatment.</P>
<P>
<U>Analgesic-decongestant:</U> six trials. One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73% benefited compared with 52% in the control group (paracetamol) (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.52).</P>
<P>
<U>Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant:</U> Five trials. Four trials reported on global effectiveness, two could be pooled: global effect reported (less than one severity point on a four or five-point scale) with active treatment (52%) and placebo (34%); the OR of treatment failure was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.67) and the NNTB was 5.6 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.2). Two other trials found no beneficial effect. Two other studies did not show any effect.</P>
<P>Two studies with antihistamine-decongestant (113 children) could not be pooled. There was no significant effect of the active treatment.</P>
<P>
<U>Adverse effects</U>: the combination of antihistamine-decongestant had more adverse effects than the control intervention but the difference was not significant: 157/810 (19%) versus 60/477 (13%) participants suffered one or more adverse effects (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.21). Analgesic-decongestant combinations had significantly more adverse effects than control (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37); the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 14. None of the other two combinations caused significantly more adverse effects. Antihistamine-analgesic: 11/90 with combination suffered one or more adverse effects (12%) versus 9/91 (10%) with control (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.23). Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: in one study 5/224 (2%) suffered adverse effects with active treatment versus 9/208 (4%) with placebo. Two other trials reported no differences between treatment groups but numbers were not reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-31 10:24:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:07:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:07:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>The common cold is probably the most common illness known. It is a recurrent, acute respiratory tract infection which affects the whole population. On average, young children have six to eight colds per year and adults have two to four (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>). The occurrence of the common cold is clearly related to the seasons. In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, the frequency of respiratory infections increases rapidly in the autumn, remains fairly high throughout the winter, and decreases again in the spring. In tropical areas, most colds occur during the rainy season (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the common cold is not a serious condition, it has a substantial impact on time lost from work and school, general practitioner consultations and money spent on both prescription and over-the counter (OTC) medications. In the US there is a loss of approximately 22 million school days and 20 million work days, as well as 25 million visits to the family physician annually due to the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIAID-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIAID 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>More than 200 different viruses are known to cause the common cold. Rhinovirus is by far the most frequent cause of the common cold (30% to 50%), although a substantial number are caused by coronaviruses (10% to 15%). Respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza and adenovirus have also been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Wat-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wat 2004</LINK>). The relative proportion of the different virus types depends on several factors such as age, season, virus sampling and detection methods. In 20% to 30% of cases no cause can be found. The recent discovery of a new virus in young children indicates that a number of infectious agents causing colds are yet to be identified (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the prevalence of rhinovirus, most studies of common colds are based on this virus (<LINK REF="REF-Wat-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wat 2004</LINK>). The infection is transmitted to the nasal epithelium by airborne droplets and by hand from fomites. The initial accumulation of rhinovirus in the eyes and nose leads to attachment of the virus to intercellular receptors at the back of the throat. The detailed mechanisms by which viral infection causes changes in the nasal mucosa are still incompletely understood. The absence of epithelial destruction during rhinovirus infections has led to the idea that the clinical symptoms of the common cold might not be caused by a direct cytopathic effect of the viruses but instead are primarily caused by the inflammatory response of the host. There is evidence of increased concentrations of several mediators which affect the vascular tissues of the nasal epithelium causing engorgement and vascular permeability (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wat-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wat 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The symptoms of the common cold arise after an incubation period that can vary considerably between different viruses. The incubation period for a rhinovirus infection is eight to 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002a</LINK>). Generally symptom severity increases rapidly, peaking within two to three days after infection, and decreasing soon after. The mean duration of the common cold is seven to 10 days, but in a proportion of patients some symptoms can still be present after three weeks. Rhinovirus infections typically start with a 'scratchy' throat, which is soon accompanied by nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing and cough. The soreness of the throat usually disappears quickly, whereas the initial watery rhinorrhoea turns thicker and more purulent. The purulence of the nasal discharge is not associated with changes in the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora. Fever is an infrequent finding during rhinovirus infections in adults, but is fairly common in children (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinnen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinnen 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:07:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Since there is no widely available cure or vaccination for the common cold, treatment is focused on alleviating the symptoms. There is limited evidence that first-generation antihistamines have a limited effect on rhinorrhoea and sneezing (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>). Decongestants can reduce nasal blockage and secretion through vasoconstriction of the nasal vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Taverner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taverner 2007</LINK>). Analgesics can relieve headache, muscle ache, sore throat or mild fever, and in the case of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may suppress the inflammatory response caused by the viral infection. NSAIDs have been shown to reduce symptoms in rhinovirus infections (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-20 18:11:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Combinations of antihistamines, decongestants and analgesics are used to relieve the broad spectrum of common cold symptoms. The evidence of the effectiveness of these combinations in relieving cold symptoms is summarised in this review.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-24 09:27:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Although combination formulas containing antihistamines, decongestants and/or analgesics are prescribed or sold OTC in large quantities for the common cold, their effectiveness is not clear. A previous Cochrane Review that is currently being updated reviewed the evidence for effectiveness of antihistamines in monotherapy in treating the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>). Our Review complements that work by summarising the evidence on effectiveness of a broader range of therapies containing antihistamines in combination with other active agents such as analgesics and/or decongestants.</P>

<P>We assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two authors (AK, OL with supervision from MVD) independently assessed the risk of bias by assessing random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias. We discussed disagreements with the supervisor and resolved them by consensus. The results are reported in the 'Risk of bias' tables in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-08-24 09:36:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>There was a wide variation in the ways outcome was presented across the trials. In most of the studies the outcome measures were a global evaluation of effectiveness (for example, complete relief, marked, moderate, slight or no relief at all), or a decrease in the severity of individual common cold symptoms assessed by severity scales or by global evaluation of effectiveness. We did not extract data where individual severity scores were added up and effectiveness was evaluated by comparing these sum scores, because the clinical meaning of sum scores is unclear. We compared the proportion of patients with treatment failure at the end of the treatment to evaluate the global effectiveness. We used odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure with 95% CI to report the effect estimate for dichotomous data. We used mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.</P>

<P>Individual patients were used as the unit of analysis. If the unit of randomisation was not the same as the unit of analysis, such as in cluster-randomised trials, we had planned to apply the correction for clustering as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We attempted to contact the trial authors in order to obtain the necessary data where original data were missing.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-24 09:55:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We assessed the presence of heterogeneity using a two-stepped approach. First, we assessed heterogeneity between trials at face value (for example, obviously different populations, settings, treatment regimens). We did not pool data if clinical heterogeneity was clearly present. Secondly, we assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as detailed in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This evaluates whether variations in the results of different trials are attributable to chance alone or whether they were the result of differences in trial design. We considered a Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test result with a P &lt; 0.10 and an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistical result of 50% or higher as indicative of substantial heterogeneity.</P>

We retrieved 51 papers for more detailed evaluation, 27 of which met the criteria for inclusion. There was complete agreement between the review authors assessing the papers. In an updated search in December 2011 one potentially relevant additional trial was identified. This study will be assessed for an update of the review once the full paper has been obtained.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:26:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The trials showed important differences in study participants, interventions, outcomes and designs. In most reports there was inadequate information to allow pooling of data and requests to trial authors for additional data remained unanswered. Therefore, pooling of data was very limited, and consequently we analysed four different treatment combinations in this review. We have summarised available numerical outcomes of the different trials in the <LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK> section.</P>
<P>Details of included population, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, intervention and dosage, outcome measures, and main methodological shortcomings ('Risk of bias' assessment) for the individual studies are summarised in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>In total, 27 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The interventions consisted of combinations of antihistamines (azatadine, pyrilamine, clemastine, diphenhydramine, dexchlorpheniramine, doxylamine, brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, pheniramine, triprolidine, promethazine, loratadine, dexbrompheniramine, carbinoxamine) with decongestants (ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphtyl imidazoline) and/or analgesics (acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen)).</P>
<P>We divided the trials into four treatment groups. The first group consisted of 14 trials evaluating antihistamine-decongestant combinations; in two of these trials active treatment also contained an antitussive. The second group contained two trials, which evaluated antihistamine-analgesic combinations. The third group comprised of six trials studying analgesic-decongestant combinations. Finally, the fourth group of five studies investigated a combination of the three agents. In one study two different combinations were used: analgesic + antihistamine for night time and analgesic + decongestant for day time. We included the day time combination in the analgesic-decongestant group and the night time combination in the antihistamine-analgesic group.</P>
<P>Nineteen trials compared active treatment with placebo. One trial had a cross-over design. Four trials had more than one active treatment arm (one of the components of the combination, a different dosage of the same combination, or a different combination). In four studies the control group took active treatment (paracetamol (two studies); chlorphenindione + phenylpropanolamine + belladonna; diphenhydramine).</P>
<P>The 27 trials involved 5117 participants suffering from a common cold. Most studies involved adult participants. In eight trials children were included: two trials included very young children (from six months to five years); four included children aged 2 to 16, at least four years old, at least six years old, and 6 to 12 years, respectively. One trial included adults and children aged six to 12 years.</P>
<P>The trials took place in different settings: university clinics, paediatric departments, family medicine departments and general practice surgeries. Seven trials were multi centre trials. In two trials the participants were experimentally infected with cold viruses, and in 25 trials the participants had community-acquired colds. In most studies the recruitment of the participants was not clearly defined.</P>
<P>In the vast majority of studies the inclusion criterion was the presence of common cold symptoms. There was a lot of diversity between studies. In general a minimal score on a symptom severity scale was required. This score was calculated by adding the individual severity scores of a number of typical common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, chills, sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough and malaise. In two studies the inclusion criterion was the serum neutralising antibody titre (1:2) to the challenge rhinovirus. In one study the inclusion criterion was the presence of cough attributed to an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In another study the inclusion criterion was nasal obstruction assessed by rhinomanometry. In yet another study the inclusion criterion was the presence of congestive rhinitis.</P>
<P>In 15 studies respiratory allergy was an explicit exclusion criterion. One study was conducted outside the pollen season and another study excluded patients with recent hay fever. In 10 studies it is unclear whether or not patients with allergies were excluded.</P>
<P>In the majority of studies the duration of symptoms before inclusion was less than 48 hours. In three trials this was up to three days, in two up to five days, and in two (paediatric trials) up to seven days. In the trials dealing with experimental colds, the therapy started 24 and 30 hours after virus challenge. The majority of trials lasted for five days, but this varied from single administration to eight days of treatment. Diaries were usually kept for the duration of treatment. The longest follow-up period was 14 days.</P>
<P>Only three studies reported independent financial support. All others were fully or partly supported by pharmaceutical companies by means of grants, supply of study drugs or other forms of assistance. In nine studies the source of financial support was not clear.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-12-07 17:48:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>We included 27 trials involving 5117 participants with the common cold. Fourteen trials studied antihistamine and decongestant combinations (antihistamine-decongestant); two studied antihistamine and analgesic combinations (antihistamine-analgesic); six studied analgesic and decongestant combinations (antihistamine-decongestant); and five studied antihistamine, analgesic and decongestant combinations (antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic). Two trials studied different combinations. The reporting of methods used was poor in most trials and there were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, control conditions and outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, most combinations had a significant effect on general recovery in adults and older children. Antihistamine-decongestant odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.50). We could not pool data for other combinations. The combinations containing a decongestant also had some effect on nasal obstruction. Rhinorrhoea and cough improved with antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic, while antihistamine-decongestant combinations may have some effect on severity of sneezing, but not on the first day of treatment. The size of the effect on the specific symptoms, when reported, was less than one severity point on a four- or five-point scale. The combinations containing antihistamine-decongestant and analgesic-decongestant had significantly more adverse effects than placebo. Many different adverse effects are mentioned. There is insufficient evidence for effectiveness in young children.</P>

The pooled risk ratio of therapy failure at final evaluation was 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.50) and the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) was 4.4. The <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK> trial could not be included in the meta-analysis because numerical data were not reported. However, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> were in line with the other trials. <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK> showed no effect.</P>
<P>Therefore, we can conclude that antihistamine-decongestant combinations have some effect on general recovery compared to placebo treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Nasal symptoms and cough</HEADING>
<P>(a) Objective nasal obstruction</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aschan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Aschan 1974</LINK> recorded positive rhinomanometric changes in nasal patency in 24/30 participants after a single dose of active treatment. With placebo there were no positive changes (P &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK> study phenylpropanolamine + carbinoxamine had some effect on nasal resistance in adult participants 30 minutes to two hours after intake of medication (P &lt; 0.05), but there was no effect in children. The combination of phenylpropanolamine + phenyramine maleate + mepyramine maleate was ineffective. In the <LINK REF="STD-Robert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Robert 2004</LINK> trial participants' peak nasal flow was evaluated before and after three days of treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo.</P>
<P>Pooling of results was not possible because different outcome measures were used. Results are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The two trials showing positive results in objective nasal patency had small sample sizes and took place in an experimental setting (<LINK REF="STD-Aschan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Aschan 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK>). One study has serious methodological problems (<LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK>). The third trial took place in a clinical setting and had a much larger sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Robert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Robert 2004</LINK>). This trial showed no effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that antihistamine + decongestant combinations probably have no effect on objectively measured nasal patency in clinical circumstances, although there may be some effect in experimental settings.</P>
<P>(b) Subjective severity assessment of nasal obstruction</P>
<P>Seven trials including 677 participants assessed the effect of antihistamine-decongestant combinations on the subjective severity of nasal obstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK> trial parents assessed severity of nasal congestion in their children. There was no significant difference between treatment groups (P values not mentioned) on any of the four treatment days. Nor was there any significant difference in nasal congestion between the treatment groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK> studies (P values not mentioned).</P>
<P>On the other hand the <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK> trial found significantly less nasal obstruction with active treatment, but only on day one (P value not mentioned).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial the severity scores for nasal obstruction were significantly lower in the active treatment group from day one to day five (P &lt; 0.05). This was also the case in the <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK> study on days two and three (P &lt; 0.01), four (P &lt; 0.05) and five (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK> study showed a significant effect on nasal congestion with active treatment compared with control at both evaluation times (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>We could not pool data from these trials because of differences in outcome measures and lack of adequate data. Results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The trials showing no effect had methodological problems (<LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK>), had a small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1982</LINK>) or compared two active treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK>). The trials demonstrating some positive effect are larger and of higher methodological quality. The size of the effect is only reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial (the difference in mean severity score of nasal congestion between treatment groups being at most 0.3 severity points on a four-point scale). We can conclude that antihistamine + decongestant combinations may have a limited effect on subjective severity of nasal obstruction, but it is not clear whether this is clinically significant.</P>
<P>(c) Effect on results on anterior rhinoscopy</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lebacq-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lebacq 1994</LINK> trial the condition of the nasal mucosa was assessed at different time points using a four-point scale (normal, red, violet, blue). There was no difference in the aspect of the nasal mucosa between treatment groups (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> study, physicians assessed severity of swelling and hyperaemia on day three and five of treatment and found no significant differences.</P>
<P>(d) Rhinorrhoea</P>
<P>Seven trials including 877 cold episodes assessed the effect of an antihistamine-decongestant combination on rhinorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schrooten-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schrooten 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated rhinorrhoea in an objective way by counting used tissues (<LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK>) or by weighing the used tissues (<LINK REF="STD-Schrooten-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schrooten 1993</LINK>). They found no difference between treatment groups.</P>
<P>Five other trials evaluated rhinorrhoea using a subjective severity score. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK> trial no effect of active treatment was noted. In the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial, severity scores for rhinorrhoea were significantly lower in the active treatment group on day two (P &lt; 0.05) and four (P &lt; 0.05) but not on days one, three and five. In the <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK> trial this was the case on day two (P &lt; 0.05) and three (P &lt; 0.01), but not on day one, four and five; and in the <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK> trial on day three (P &lt; 0.05), but not on the other nine observation days. Finally, in the <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK> study there was a significant effect on rhinorrhoea with active treatment compared with control at both evaluation times (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Again pooling was not possible. Available results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In only one of the trials with a positive result the size of the effect on nasal discharge was reported: in the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial the difference in mean severity score between treatment groups is at most 0.3 severity point on a four-point scale. We can conclude that although a small effect on rhinorrhoea on some days of a treatment with a combination of antihistamine + decongestant cannot be excluded, a clinically relevant effect is unlikely.</P>
<P>(e) Sneezing</P>
<P>Sneezing was investigated in five trials including 718 cold episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK>). In four trials there is some effect (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial severity scores for sneezing are significantly lower with active treatment from day two until day five (all P &lt; 0.05). In the <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK> trial this was the case on days two, three and four (no P values mentioned) and in the <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 1983</LINK> trial on days two to eight (day two: P &lt; 0.05; day three: P &lt; 0.001; day four P &lt; 0.01; day six and seven: P &lt; 0.01; and day eight: P &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK> mentions a significant effect on sneezing with active treatment compared with control at both evaluation times (P &lt; 0.001). <LINK REF="STD-Debelic-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Debelic 1973</LINK> compared two active combinations and found no difference.</P>
<P>Pooling of results was not possible. All available data are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. All trials in which this symptom was evaluated found some effect of the active treatment in comparison with placebo. However, in only one trial the size of the effect was reported: in the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> trial the difference in mean severity score between treatment groups is at most 0.3 severity point on a four-point scale. We can tentatively conclude that a combination of antihistamine-decongestant has some effect on sneezing, but the effect is small and probably not clinically relevant.</P>
<P>(f) Cough</P>
<P>Four trials including 672 cold episodes evaluated the effect of an antihistamine-decongestant combination on the severity of cough (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK>). Neither <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Bye-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bye 1980</LINK> found any significant difference in severity of cough between the active treatment group and the control group. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK> the mean severity score for cough was significantly less on days three, four and five (P &lt; 0.05). In the paediatric trial by <LINK REF="STD-Weippl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weippl 1984</LINK> there was a statistically significant improvement of cough at the interim visit in comparison to control (P = 0.03). Pooling was not possible. All available data are represented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK> study included 1167 adult cold patients and assessed the effect of Grippostad®, a combined formulation of acetaminophen + caffeine + chlorpheniramine + ascorbic acid in comparison with two references (chlorpheniramine + ascorbic acid and acetaminophen + caffeine + ascorbic acid) and ascorbic acid. The treatment was given for six days. The participants assessed the severity of their cold symptoms daily, and sum scores were calculated. Data for individual symptoms were not provided.

<P>Two trials evaluating 1358 participants, assessed the global effectiveness of antihistamine + analgesic in the common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK> trial, the proportion of participants who were completely cured at the end of the trial with Grippostad® was 70% and with control (ascorbic acid) was 43%. This difference is highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK> trial overall subjective assessment was measured at the end of the study by asking: "on the whole do you think the tablets have helped you?" Significantly more patients receiving the active night time medication compared with the control group (paracetamol) responded affirmative to the question: 73% versus 52% (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>We did not pool these data because one of the trials used an active control (<LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">C. Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>All three trials evaluated adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK>). Many different adverse effects were described: nasal dryness, nasal irritation, blood stained nasal mucus, drowsiness, dry mouth, gastrointestinal upset, loss of appetite, headache, depression and dizziness. Most of the adverse effects were rare and mentioned in only one trial (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Total number of patients suffering side effects</HEADING>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Koytchev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koytchev 2003</LINK>, 39 out of 1167 participants mentioned a side effect. There were no differences between the different treatment groups. In the trial of Middleton both combinations (day and night) were evaluated together: 11 out of 79 participants taking paracetamol, and nine out of 82 participants taking active treatment mentioned adverse effects (P = 0.57).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patients suffering drowsiness</HEADING>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 2002</LINK> five out of 61 participants taking active treatment and zero out of 30 participants taking placebo suffered from drowsiness (P = 0.03). In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK> drowsiness was mentioned by five participants taking paracetamol and by four participants taking the combination therapy (P = 0.68). After pooling, 7% of participants taking the combination therapy and 3% of participants taking placebo or paracetamol suffered from drowsiness. This difference was not significant (P = 0.28).</P>
<P>Other side effects were very rare and there were no differences between treatment groups (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). We can conclude that the combination of antihistamine with analgesics is generally well tolerated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">A. Short description of the studies</HEADING>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2006a</LINK> examined the effectiveness of a combination of pseudoephedrine + paracetamol in comparison to placebo, or pseudoephedrine, or paracetamol in monotherapy (four arms). In total, 305 participants with a natural cold were included. Included participants had symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection with pain of at least moderate intensity and nasal obstruction measurable by rhinomanometry. Effectiveness of treatment on nasal obstruction was assessed during the first four hours after administration of one dose by rhinomanometry, during the next three days of treatment by subjective assessment of nasal congestion, and finally by a global assessment of nasal congestion relief at the follow-up visit after three days of therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Loose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loose 2004</LINK> studied the effect of a single-dose acetylsalicylic acid + pseudoephedrine and pseudoephedrine + paracetamol compared to placebo, in 643 adults with a cold and nasal congestion for five days. Outcomes were the change in nasal congestion score (on an 11-point scale for severity of nasal congestion) and change in the subjective severity of nasal congestion two, four and six hours after the ingestion of the study medication.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1994</LINK> investigated the effectiveness of naproxen + pseudoephedrine compared to pseudoephedrine and placebo in 65 paediatric participants aged two to 16 years. The treatment was administrated three times daily for five days in different concentrations, depending on the age of the child. The duration of nasal symptoms (nasal oedema and nasal congestion) was evaluated at the end of the study.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK> study included 191 participants, and studied the effectiveness of 'Benylin Day and Night', a combined formulation composed of two different combinations of active substances: Benylin Day (paracetamol + phenylpropanolamine) and Benylin Night (paracetamol + diphenhydramine hydrochloride) compared to paracetamol. This trial was already described in the previous section. Here we will consider the day combination.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK> study, 58 participants developed a cold after experimental virus inoculation. They were kept under observation until six days after inoculation and were treated with a combination of pseudoephedrine + ibuprofen, or pseudoephedrine or placebo. Subjective severity of cold symptoms (runny nose, nasal obstruction, sneezing, cough) were evaluated daily. Rhinorrhoea was further evaluated by weighing used tissues. Nasal congestion was measured by anterior rhinometry. In this review we consider the comparison between pseudoephedrine + ibuprofen and placebo.</P>
<P>In another trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 2000</LINK> the effectiveness of two doses (the second dose was administrated six hours after the first) of pseudoephedrine + acetaminophen was compared with placebo in 430 adult participants with a natural cold. Participants were evaluated two hours after each administration. Effectiveness of the treatment was measured against the subjective severity of common cold symptoms (nasal obstruction, sneezing, cough, rhinorrhoea) and was assessed using a five-point severity scale.</P>

<P>Only one trial assessed overall subjective effectiveness at the end of the study by asking "on the whole do you think the tablets have helped you?" (<LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK>). Significantly more participants receiving the active day time medication compared with the control group (paracetamol) responded affirmative to the question: 73% versus 52% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.83, P &lt; 0.01).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1. Objective nasal obstruction</HEADING>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>, recipients of the active treatment showed improved nasal patency from the pre-treatment baseline flow rates on day four (P = 0.08) and five (P = 0.06) of treatment. The overall and daily patency tended to be greater in the recipients of pseudoephedrine plus ibuprofen compared to placebo. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2006a</LINK>, the combination treatment was more effective than placebo in increasing nasal airflow conductance (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Subjective severity assessment of nasal obstruction</HEADING>
<P>This symptom was assessed in six trials.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1981</LINK> the severity of nasal obstruction was not significantly different between the treatment group and placebo group. Conversely, in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1994</LINK>, active treatment significantly reduced the duration of nasal congestion.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Loose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loose 2004</LINK>, the differences from baseline of the nasal congestion scores and nasal relief scores were statistically larger (P &lt; 0.05) for all active treatments and at all observation intervals compared to placebo. The peak difference was noted at 120 minutes after dosing. The differences between the different active combinations were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK> evaluated nasal congestion during five days of therapy on a four-point scale. There was a statistically significant difference in the sum of the day scores between the active treatment (4 +/- 3) and placebo (7 +/- 2, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In the other trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 2000</LINK> the mean difference in nasal congestion score at the beginning of the study and after the first and second administration of active medication was evaluated on a five-point scale. Two hours after the first dose there was a statistically significant decrease (P = 0.002) in favour of active treatment. After the second administration the difference was still statistically significant, but smaller (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2006a</LINK> study the sum of nasal congestion differences over three days of treatment was significantly higher with active treatment than with placebo (P = 0.0042) or paracetamol (P = 0.02). The global nasal congestion relief was also greater with active treatment compared to paracetamol or placebo (P = 0.00 4). This was not the case when the combination was compared to pseudo-ephedrine in mono-therapy.</P>
<P>Results of these trials could not be pooled because of differences in outcome measures or lack of adequate data. Results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>From these results we can conclude that decongestant-analgesic combinations are probably effective in alleviating nasal obstruction. In three trials there are some data on the size of the effect: in the trial of Sperber (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>) the difference in the sum of the severity scores over five days is three points on a four-point scale. In the second trial of <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 2000</LINK> the difference is, at most, 1.06 severity points on a five-point scale. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2006a</LINK> the mean sum of nasal congestion differences over three days is 0.69 (on a four-point scale) and the difference in global nasal congestion relief is 0.7 (on a five-point scale) .</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">3. Effect on results on anterior rhinoscopy</HEADING>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Blanco-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blanco 2000</LINK> study participants were evaluated on the third and fifth day of treatment using a five-point severity score.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:07:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-06 21:01:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>In this review we evaluated the effectiveness of four different combinations of over-the-counter (OTC) treatments for the common cold. All four combinations showed a general benefit in adults and children aged over six years. Where pooling of results was possible we found a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of four (for the combination of antihistamine-decongestant). The combination of antihistamine-analgesic was beneficial in the two trials and the combination of analgesic-decongestant was beneficial in the one trial with data on this outcome. The combination of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic was more effective than control in two of the four trials, one of which was recent, large and of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>). General improvement is a significant outcome since the literature shows that patients suffering from a common cold find their generalised symptoms and functional impairment more important than specific symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Barret-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barret 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>All combinations containing decongestants reduced nasal obstruction. Antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations seemed to have some additional effect on cough and rhinorrhoea and antihistamine-decongestant combinations may have some effect on subjective severity of sneezing, but not on the first day of treatment. Yet, when the size of the effect was reported (which was rarely the case), it was invariably small (less that one point on a four- or five-point severity scale).</P>
<P>Adverse effects were not always clearly reported but with the available data we found that adverse effects were usually more frequent with active treatment than with control. Dry mouth and insomnia are more frequent with antihistamine-decongestant and dizziness is more frequent with analgesic-decongestant combinations. The other two combinations, antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic and antihistamine-analgesic, were well tolerated which is rather remarkable as they contain similar products as the two other combinations. It is unclear whether for patients the benefits justify this cost of adverse effects. In a recent study on severity reduction in the common cold <LINK REF="REF-Barret-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barret 2007</LINK> found that a sufficiently important difference meaning "the smallest amount of patient-valued benefit that an intervention would require in order to justify associated costs, risk and other harms" was about 25% for a cheap treatment without adverse effects. The effect found on severity of specific symptoms is much lower than this.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-15 14:22:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the number of studies was small, the majority of the studies included participants suffering from a community-acquired common cold, investigated current combinations of cold medications, and used as outcomes the subjective assessment by the participants. Therefore, the results of this systematic review seem generalisable.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:27:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>The most striking finding is that in spite of the large number of combination products and formulations on the market and the vast amounts sold, there are only a limited number of studies evaluating their effectiveness, especially in young children. The most studied combination was antihistamines combined with decongestants (eight trials in adults (n = 1091), two in young children (n = 113) and four including older children (n = 214)); the least studied combination was antihistamines with analgesics (three trials in adults (n = 1508)). For analgesics with decongestants we found five trials in adults and one in children (n = 1692), and for the combination of antihistamines with decongestants and analgesics we found four trials in adults and one in children (n = 961). The trials we found differed from each other in every possible aspect: definitions of the common cold, inclusion and exclusion criteria, settings, method of infection (natural (N = 25) or experimental (N = 2)), interventions, control and outcome measures. Pooling of results was very rarely possible and our conclusions are based on a global assessment of the result of each trial (effective/not effective) rather than on numerical data. The overall quality of the included trials was acceptable, although often a clear description of the methods used was missing. In some of the (often older) trials, data required to judge the methodological rigour were not reported at all (mostly information related to the randomisation process). However, the results of these older studies were in line with the more recent higher quality studies and therefore we think that this does not pose a threat to the validity of the meta-analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:27:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite our extensive search it is possible that we did not find all relevant trials, because it seems unlikely that so few studies have been performed in view of the vast market for an active preparation. Our results might be over-optimistic and publication bias cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>In most studies it is unclear how the participants were recruited, in other words, it is not clear if the included participants were actively seeking care of their symptoms of the common cold. This may jeopardise the generalisability of the findings. This also raises some ethical issues, as treatments with possible adverse effects may have been given to patients with minor self limiting illnesses.</P>
<P>We have excluded illnesses with a possible bacterial cause or potentially non-self limiting course or conditions which might interfere with the natural course of the common cold (such as allergies). Allergies were also excluded because antihistamines are an effective treatment for them.</P>
<P>We have included studies using active controls because we feel that this makes the review more comprehensive as comparison with an active control allows us to assess the added value of the combination versus a single substance or a current treatment.</P>
<P>As not all studies reported on the occurrence of adverse effects it is possible that the number of adverse effects is underestimated. Some trials evaluated the immediate effect of one dose of active medication; other trials looked at the effectiveness over the duration of the cold. Although these are very different outcomes, both are relevant in view of the goals of the review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-07 10:07:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Our results are in line with the results of other reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK> extensively reviewed the effectiveness of OTC cold medications and concluded that there was very little evidence of effectiveness in young children but that some medications and combinations were effective in adolescents and adults, which is confirmed by our findings. <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK> showed that there was no good evidence of effectiveness of OTC medication for acute cough but that results of studies were conflicting. In our review we found some evidence of effectiveness in cough in adults with the combination of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic mainly due to the results of one trial not included in the review by Smith (<LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Taverner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taverner 2007</LINK> concluded that a single oral dose of nasal decongestant is modestly effective for short-term relief of congestion in adults and that these medications also provide benefit after regular use over three to five days. This is in accordance with our findings that combinations with decongestants decrease nasal obstruction. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2006b</LINK> on the efficacy and safety of OTC analgesics in the treatment of common cold and flu showed that there is little information on the use of analgesics in treating colds. Safety and efficacy data must be related to other pain and fever models. The authors conclude that these medications are effective, which confirms our findings that most combinations showed some general benefit.</P>
<P>As to the possible risks, it has to be noted that in 2005 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States issued a warning for OTC nasal preparations containing phenylpropanolamine because of the increased risk of intracranial bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2005</LINK>). Moreover, since 2000 the poison-control centres have reported more than 750,000 calls of concern related to cough and cold products. A recent report from the Centres of Disease Control and Prevention identified more than 1500 emergency room visits in 2004 and 2005 for children under two years of age who had been given cough or cold products, and a review by the FDA identified 123 deaths related to the use of such products in children under six years of age over the past few decades (<LINK REF="REF-Sharfstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharfstein 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-31 11:03:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>The scarce data on the effectiveness of antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations for the common cold shows that there is some general benefit in adults and older children which, however, must be weighed against the risk of adverse events. The effect on individual symptoms is probably too small to be clinically relevant. Combinations containing phenylpropanolamine must be avoided. In young children these combinations should not be used since there is no evidence of effectiveness and they are potentially dangerous. This means that the combinations studied can be used in adults and older children in order to improve general symptoms of the common cold.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-10 22:28:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Our review shows that there is evidence to support the effectiveness of combinations with antihistamines, decongestants and analgesics compared to placebo. However, it is unclear if the effect is due to the effect of one of the components alone or the combination product. Further trials are needed to explore the added value of combining these individual components in comparison with each in monotherapy. Analgesics and decongestants have some effect in monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taverner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taverner 2007</LINK>). Further trials comparing the effectiveness of a single component with a combination may show that the single component is equally effective. Especially, attention should be given to investigating the balance between increased risk of adverse events and clinical benefit. Future studies should report on recruitment of patients, randomisation procedures and include information on the patient perspective. All studies should report patient well-being as the primary outcome, as the benign course of the common cold makes laboratory outcomes or quantification of mucus etc. irrelevant for clinical practice. We do not recommend new studies in small children, given the potentially dangerous adverse effects in children and the benign course of the common cold.</P>
