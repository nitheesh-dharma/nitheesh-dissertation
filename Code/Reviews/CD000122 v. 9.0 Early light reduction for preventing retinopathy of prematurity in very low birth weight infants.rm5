<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:21:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retinopathy of prematurity (a common retinal neovascular disorder of premature infants) is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. The cause of advanced retinopathy of prematurity and the way the disease develops are not fully understood. In the past many factors, such as the use of supplemental oxygen, excessive light exposure and hypoxia (lack of oxygen), have been suggested as possible causes. Light exposure has been investigated because experimental studies have demonstrated that intensive lighting can result in irreversible damage to the retina. However, the clinical studies conducted to date have shown conflicting results in terms of the effects of light in the development of the disease. Furthermore, studies have concluded that reduction of light exposure does not reduce the progression of retinopathy of prematurity.</P>
<P>This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of early light reduction to prevent retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight infants. We selected randomised controlled trials (a specific type of scientific experiment to test the efficacy and/or effectiveness of various types of medical intervention within a patient population). Four studies (seven publications) with a reasonable methodological quality were included with a total of 897 participants. The evidence shows that bright light is not the cause of retinopathy of prematurity and that the reduction of exposure of the retinas of premature infants to light has no effect on the incidence of the disease. This evidence is up to October 2012.</P>

<P>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex condition of the developing retinal blood vessels and is one of the leading causes of preventable childhood blindness. Several risk factors for ROP have been studied over the past 50 years. Among them, general immaturity (low birth weight and low gestational age) and prolonged oxygen therapy have been consistently related to disease onset. However, it is understood that the progression of the disease is multifactorial and may be associated with others risk factors, such as multiple gestation, apnoea, intracranial haemorrhage, anaemia, sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, multiple transfusions and light exposure. Furthermore, the precise role of these individual factors in the development of the disease has not yet been well established.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:52:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:25:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common retinal neovascular disorder of premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1991</LINK>). It is of variable severity and usually heals with mild or no sequelae, but may progress in some infants to partial vision loss or blindness from retinal detachments or severe retinal scar formation. The disease is described clinically by the International Classification of ROP which uses the location in the retina (zones), extent of disease (clock hours of disease), severity of the neovascularisation (stages) and the presence or absence of 'plus' disease to describe categories of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-ICROP-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICROP 1984</LINK>). Categories of 'pre-threshold' and 'threshold' are summary descriptions of ROP disease severity with prognostic significance developed by the Cryotherapy for ROP Co-operative Group, where eyes that developed threshold ROP had an observed rate of 47% progression to retinal detachment (<LINK REF="REF-CRYO_x002d_ROP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRYO-ROP 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of both any acute ROP and of the more severe stages varies inversely with gestational age at birth. ROP is unusual (except in the mildest forms) in infants of more than 31 weeks gestation, and severe complications such as retinal detachment occur in less than one-half of one per cent of infants of more than 31 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1991</LINK>). However, 84% of infants of less than 28 weeks gestation develop some ROP and close to 11% develop 'threshold ROP' and undergo ablative surgery (cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation) to the peripheral avascular retina to reduce the risk of disease progression to retinal detachment (<LINK REF="REF-CRYO_x002d_ROP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRYO-ROP 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In more than half a century of intense clinical and laboratory research, great advancements have been made in elucidating the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity. Currently, it is known that ROP is a two-phase disease. Phase 1 begins when retinal vascular growth ceases after premature birth (roughly 22 to 30 weeks' postmenstrual age). For a period of time, the vessel formation is halted at the interface between the vascular and avascular retina. It is now understood that phase 1 involves relative hyperoxia and a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Phase 2 (from roughly 31 to 44 weeks' postmenstrual age) is triggered by an increase in VEGF concentrations, in an attempt to compensate for the hypoxic retina (<LINK REF="REF-Hellstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mintz_x002d_Hittner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintz-Hittner 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:29:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Efforts to reduce morbidity from ROP can be grouped into preventive and interdictive categories. While prevention would be best aimed at preventing premature birth, once that birth is inevitable such efforts are directed at reducing the stresses that may lead to injury of the developing retinal capillaries. To date, these have focused on antioxidants, reduction of light exposure and control of exogenous oxygen delivery. Animal models or clinical data have suggested that each of these are candidates for causing retinal injury. For the purposes of determining what preventive treatments to consider using, it is important to remember that preventive interventions must be applied to all premature infants, not just those infants who develop ROP, and that therefore potential side effects should be minimal.</P>
<P>Interdictive approaches target just those eyes that already have ROP of a defined severity. The goal is to control or arrest the progression of the neovascularisation (even at the sacrifice of some of the retina) in order to preserve central vision. Cryosurgical or laser ablation of the peripheral avascular retina destroys the cells that are the putative source of the neovascular growth factors, thus allowing regression of the neovascularisation. Anti-VEGF drugs are an alternative treatment for poor ROP.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exogenous light exposure</HEADING>
<P>It is hypothesised that oxygen free radicals are one cause of injury to developing retinal capillaries in the premature infant (<LINK REF="STD-Hepner-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Locke-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Locke 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riley-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1969</LINK>). Energy from light striking the retina may induce, or increase, the number of oxygen free radicals in the retina, particularly in the face of high levels of tissue oxygen. Numerous animal studies have demonstrated retinal injury from light, but these injuries have been to other parts of the retina than the blood vessels, namely the photoreceptors, cornea or lens, depending on the amount and wavelengths of the light used (<LINK REF="REF-Lawwill-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawwill 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricci-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricci 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wesolowski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wesolowski 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Many years ago, light was seen as a risk factor for the development of ROP in very low birth weight infants. There is still some controversy about whether reduced light could have significant protection in the development of ROP. This systematic review aims to update the knowledge in this field.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Previous overviews of light exposure</HEADING>
<P>A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographic references of published research on light exposure and personal discussion with investigators involved in ROP research uncovered only one systematic review, published in the book 'Effective Care of the Newborn Infant' (New Reference). No meta-analysis was attempted in that review due to methodological difficulties with the reported studies. New data had been published since that review (<LINK REF="STD-Seiberth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiberth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK>) and, therefore, the first Cochrane review was carried out and published in February 1997. Subsequent new research led to updates of that review in July 1997 (adding <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1997</LINK>) and August 1998 (adding <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK>). This is a second update of the review with new authorship for this update.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:45:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the assessment of study quality, we used the new 'Risk of bias' approach for Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the following five separate criteria.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated, for example with random number tables or computer-generated random numbers? We recorded this as 'low risk of bias' (the method used is either adequate or unlikely to introduce confounding), 'uncertain risk of bias' (there is insufficient information to assess whether the method used is likely to introduce confounding), or 'high risk of bias' (the method used (e.g. quasi-randomised trials) is improper and likely to introduce confounding).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: was allocation adequately concealed in a way that would not allow either the investigators or the participants to know or influence allocation to an intervention group before an eligible participant was entered into the study (for example, using central randomisation or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes held by a third party)? We recorded this as 'low risk of bias' (the method used (e.g. central allocation) is unlikely to induce bias in the final observed effect), 'uncertain risk of bias' (there is insufficient information to assess whether the method used is likely to induce bias in the estimate of effect), or 'high risk of bias' (the method used (e.g. open random allocation schedule) is likely to induce bias in the final observed effect).</LI>
<LI>Masking: were the study outcome assessors masked from knowledge of which intervention a participant received? We recorded this as 'low risk of bias' (the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of masking), 'uncertain risk of bias' (there is insufficient information to assess whether the type of masking used is likely to induce bias in the estimate of effect), or 'high risk of bias' (the outcome or the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of masking).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Incomplete outcome data essentially include: attrition, exclusions and missing data. If any withdrawals occurred, were they described and reported by treatment group with reasons given? We recorded whether or not there were clear explanations for withdrawals and dropouts in the treatment groups. An example of an adequate method to address incomplete outcome data is the use of an intention to-treat analysis (ITT). We recorded this item as 'low risk of bias' (the underlying reasons for missingness are unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods have been employed to handle missing data), 'uncertain risk of bias' (there is insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data is likely to induce bias in the estimate of effect), or 'high risk of bias' (the crude estimate of effects (e.g. complete case estimate) will clearly be biased due to the underlying reasons for missingness, and the methods used to handle missing data are unsatisfactory).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting: are reports of the study free from any suggestion of selective outcome reporting? This was interpreted as no evidence that statistically non-significant results might have been selectively withheld from publication, for example selective under-reporting of data or selective reporting of a subset of data. We recorded this as 'low risk of bias' (the trial protocol is available and all of the trials prespecified outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported or similar), 'uncertain risk of bias' (there is insufficient information to assess whether the magnitude and direction of the observed effect is related to selective outcome reporting), or 'high risk of bias' (not all of the trials prespecified primary outcomes have been reported or similar).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Information relevant for making a judgement on a criterion were copied from the original publication into an assessment table. When additional information was available from study authors, this was also entered in the table along with an indication that this was unpublished information. Two review authors (ECJ and RED) independently made a judgement as to whether the risk of bias for each criterion was considered to be 'low', 'uncertain' or 'high'. We resolved disagreements by discussion.</P>
<P>We considered trials which were classified as low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data and selective outcome reporting as low risk of bias trials.</P>
<P>We recorded this information for each included trial in 'Risk of bias' tables in RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>) and summarised the risk of bias for each study in a summary 'Risk of bias' figure and graph.</P>

<P>For the original review in 1997, one review author scanned all citations (title and abstract if listed) retrieved with the search strategy (over 90) and determined 24 to be possibly relevant (human premature infants, light reduced in the first week and ROP outcome data reported). An independent review author made the same determination on a subset of 20 of these citations and selected all of the same top-ranked 18 citations that appeared in that subset, plus four others. However, upon review of photocopies of those additional four full citations, none proved to be relevant and the decisions of the first review author were accepted on the remainder for identifying all the possibly relevant articles. During the search process, two sets of unpublished data (part of the 24), two abstracts and one ongoing trial were identified.</P>
<P>Photocopies of the 24 possibly relevant articles were provided to two independent review authors to determine the true relevance of the article and the methodology used in the study. Thirteen relevant studies contained in 12 citations were identified (one citation contained two studies). Twelve other citations proved to be editorials, letters, duplicate abstracts or subsequent publications based on the data from one of the 10 studies. The two citations of unpublished data sets were also evaluated by the review authors: one was technical pilot data without a control group and the other involved a problematic comparison group.</P>
<P>Photocopies of the 12 relevant citations were provided to two review authors to independently determine the methodology used. Methods were evaluated for masking of randomisation, masking of intervention, completeness of follow-up and masking of outcome measurement. Five randomised or quasi-randomised trials were identified. Five cohort studies comparing a period of reduced light to a non-randomised control cohort were identified, and two studies had no controls.

<P>For the first update of this review in 2000, no new trials were identified.</P>
<P>For the second update of the review in 2013, only 82 references were identified by the searches. We then selected three references for careful reading. Following assessment of the full articles, we considered two further publications for inclusion in this review: <LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK> met the minimal methodological requirements to be included in this review.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:40:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies (seven publications) were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Seiberth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiberth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK>), with a total of 897 participants.</P>
<P>It is important in each study to carefully consider whether outcomes in eyes or outcomes in infants are being reported. In the Locke study, the intervention (patching) was applied to one eye with the opposite eye serving as control, and thus each infant contributed two outcomes; one for the treated group and one for the control. In <LINK REF="STD-Seiberth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiberth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK> both eyes of each infant were treated in the same way. Therefore, each infant could contribute only once to the outcomes and was reported/recorded as the worst stage of ROP observed (presumably in either eye).</P>
<P>Additionally, because light hypothetically might be expected to affect acute ROP differently than severe ROP (poor ROP outcome), we also extracted data in categories of ROP severity, if possible. 'Poor ROP outcome' was defined as retinal detachments, partial or complete (stages 4b or 5 in the International Classification of ROP detachments, <LINK REF="REF-ICROP-II-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICROP II 1987</LINK>), or ROP of threshold severity requiring cryo/laser surgery. Original authors kindly confirmed data extraction and responded to questions that were unclear from their publications (<LINK REF="STD-Seiberth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiberth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Seiberth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiberth 1994</LINK>: 169 infants of less than 1501 g birth weight from one nursery were enrolled and then randomised (by a phone call to the randomisation centre - personal communication from authors) to no patching or patching of both eyes from the day of birth until 35 weeks postmenstrual age. Parents, nurses and paediatricians could observe the treatment assignment, but ophthalmologists determining outcomes were masked to the study group. Three families in the patched group withdrew after randomisation. Eye examinations were standardised and a calculated sample size and a priori hypotheses stated. A similar number of infants in each group were lost to follow-up due to transfers (16%) or death (six patched and eight controls). Outcomes were based on the worst stage of ROP reached in each infant and no significant differences were found.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Braz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Braz 2006</LINK> (further two publications as abstracts: Lopes 1997; Braz 1996): a randomised controlled trial enrolling 226 infants of less than 1600 g birth weight or &lt; 32 weeks gestation. In the experimental group, patching of both eyes began on the day of birth and continued until 35 weeks postmenstrual age. Because a paired randomisation within birth weight groups (two per block) was used, the investigator obtaining consent was sometimes aware of what the next randomisation assignment would be. Indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed every two weeks and recorded according to the International Classification of ROP. To date, results in 74 control and 75 experimental group survivors are reported. In both groups, 37% of surviving infants developed some degree of ROP. Two control and no experimental infants were treated with cryotherapy (presumed to have threshold ROP). It is unclear whether this study is ongoing. (Authors kindly provided additional information in addition to that in published abstracts.)</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1997</LINK>: a randomised controlled trial randomising infants weighing 1250 g or less, or of gestational age 32 weeks or less, at 0 to 6 hours after birth with consent subsequently obtained to continue the study. Goggles were worn until 31 weeks and the primary outcome was electroretinograms at 35 weeks postmenstrual age. Seventy-one of 135 infants born at less than 1251 g during the study period were randomised and 10 families subsequently refused consent to continue in the study (six control and four goggles). Of the 61 infants in the study, 11 had no outcomes due to death (six control, three goggles), or protocol violation (one goggle) or per study criteria of second surviving twin (one control). ROP was a secondary outcome, determined by residents or attendings who were masked to study assignment, and reported only as present or as reaching pre-threshold stage according to the CRYO-ROP study definitions. Therefore, only acute ROP can be reported. Acute ROP rates were similar in both groups: 29% goggles, 31% controls. While the loss to follow-up by this unusual randomisation method raises some concern, similar numbers from each group withdrew at the point of consent.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK>: infants of less than 31 weeks gestation and less than 1251 g birth weight were randomised after informed consent through a central registry to wearing goggles or control. The goggles were placed on the infant within 24 hours of birth, reducing light by 97% (100% of ultraviolet) and were continued until the infant was 31 weeks postmenstrual age or four weeks chronological age, whichever occurred later. Oxygen exposure and use was not reported. Certified study ophthalmologists masked to group assignment examined all infants starting at 32 weeks postmenstrual age and classified ROP according to the International Classification of ROP. Confirmed ROP was required for the study outcome and consisted of at least three clock hours of ROP in any zone observed on at least two examinations. However, 'any ROP' was also reported in the tables permitting direct comparison of results with previous studies. Of the 409 infants randomised, 46 died before the ROP outcome could be determined and two were lost to follow-up (distribution of these 48 infants between the 17 missing goggled infants (8.3%) and 31 missing controls (15%) is not described but has to approximate mortality in the two groups since only two infants were not lost because of death). The comparable numbers for 'any ROP' were 130 (69%) in the goggled group and 121 (70%) in the controls, and these numbers are the ones used in this review. For pre-threshold ROP it was 19/188 (10%) goggled versus 15/173 (9%) controls, and for threshold ROP it was 9/188 (4.8%) goggled versus 9/173 (5.2%) controls. For the subgroup analysis (&lt; 1 kg and &gt; 1 kg) only 'confirmed ROP' was reported and therefore was used in the data tables in this review. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Examination of the baseline characteristics revealed only minimal differences between the groups and these were associated with a slightly higher predicted risk of ROP in the control group and therefore do not affect the conclusions. Poor ROP outcome as vision loss was not reported, however, threshold ROP was used for the 'poor outcome' variable. Oxygen exposure, oxygen use and vitamin E use were not reported, and the statistical section did not address sample size or power.</LI>

<P>Six studies were excluded and are described in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Locke-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Locke 1952</LINK>: in this study, conducted before knowledge of the oxygen link to ROP, one eye of each of 22 infants (less than 2001 g birth weight) was patched from within 24 hours after birth through discharge. Non-survivors are not mentioned. Although selection of which eye was to be patched is not described, there is no biological rationale to expect one eye to be more likely to develop ROP than another. Control eyes were examined weekly with a direct ophthalmoscope, and patched eyes only at the time of discharge. If mild, transient ROP were an outcome, this would be problematic; however, the type and severity of ROP that could be detected with the direct ophthalmoscope would have been the same in both groups given the timing of examinations. Outcomes are based on eyes, rather than infants since each eye received different treatment. The first author performed all eye examinations and was not masked as to study group. No differences were observed.</P>
<P>(Used for discussion). In Locke's second study, 33 premature infants in one nursery had both eyes patched from within 24 hours of birth until discharge, and were compared to 33 premature infants of matched birth weights from the immediately preceding time period in the same nursery. Determinations of eye outcomes were with direct ophthalmoscopes as noted in study A from the same citation. These historical controls were close in time and from the same nursery, but leave reason to be concerned about the results because of potential changes in practice even over this time period. No significant differences were observed.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Hommura-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hommura 1988</LINK>: (used for discussion). Control infants included all 21 survivors of less than 1501 g birth weight born in one hospital in 1983 to 1984. Treated infants were all 16 survivors of less than 1501 g birth weight born in 1985 to 1986. Treated infants had both eyes patched from the day of birth until discharge home. Examinations were conducted weekly by one ophthalmologist not masked to study group. There were fewer cases of acute ROP in the patched infants. The results, when reported as eyes rather than as infants, are statistically significant, but not so if reported as infants. This is concerning because left and right eyes are closely correlated in this disease and therefore not independent events. For this discussion, eye outcomes were converted to infant outcomes based on the worst eye from each infant. The authors provided supplemental information to Professor Ogawa who assisted in translation.</P>
<P>3. <LINK REF="STD-Glass-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glass 1985</LINK>: (used for discussion). This study was designed to have an immediately preceding control cohort because the authors believed that concurrent controls were not possible. They felt that personnel accustomed to shielded incubators would insist on shielding all infants once the intervention had been taught. Premature infants from two nurseries had light reduction via shields placed over the incubators. The time from birth to placement in incubators that were then shielded was not controlled. This creates a potential bias against finding an effect of shielding because the sickest infants, and therefore the ones most likely to get ROP, could be more likely to stay in the radiant warmers longer and therefore could have had later shielding from light than more healthy infants.</P>
<P>Eye examinations were conducted by experienced ophthalmologists according to usual practice and they were unaware of group assignment, which could have meant that they were unaware of the research project, particularly during the control period. No mention of specific research data forms is made in the report. This is problematic because the manner in which ophthalmologists viewed ROP and its staging and medical record notes were undergoing significant changes during just this period of time. The first meeting to talk about a new international classification for ROP occurred in 1981 at the Ross Conference on ROP held in Washington DC. The second meeting which resulted in a draft classification which was to be taken home and tried out for a year occurred in Calgary, Canada in 1982. The third meeting was held at the NIH in 1983, and led to the final International Classification of ROP published in 1984. This evolution of the classification was happening during this study which recruited controls mostly in 1982 and shielded infants mostly in 1983. Therefore, these data raise concerns around the definitions of diagnoses changing with time as the study moved from enrolling controls to enrolling treated infants, as well as the non-random allocation. Statistically significantly lower rates of ROP were observed in the shielded infants. The results are used for discussion.</P>
<P>4. <LINK REF="STD-Ackerman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ackerman 1989</LINK>: (used for discussion). This study compared historical controls from an immediately preceding period to similar infants after instituting shielding of incubators. In this manner, most of the problems from the Glass study are replicated, except that the possible changing of the ROP classification is less of a problem. The time from birth until shielding is not well described, with the same bias against finding an effect as in the Glass study. Some infants may have been in open warmers for more than a week after birth before being shielded. Ophthalmologists determining outcomes were unaware of shielding status and no differences between the two cohorts was observed. There are significant chances for bias and therefore these data are used only for discussion.</P>
<P>5. <LINK REF="STD-Hepner-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Hepner 1949</LINK>: five premature infants had both eyes covered by 30 hours after birth and the patching was continued until near discharge when the first eye examination was performed. There were no controls or mention of baseline or historical rates of ROP in the paper. Four of the five infants developed severe ROP in both eyes. Ironically, the generous use of oxygen is well documented in each of these careful case histories. The authors accepted these findings as having ruled out the possibility that ambient light caused ROP. Without controls, the data cannot contribute to a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>6. <LINK REF="STD-Repka-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Repka 1996</LINK> (unpublished): these data are unpublished and found only as a personal communication in a Manual of Procedures for a current ongoing study. The data were discussed with the author (MXR) and describe the incidence of ROP in two different nurseries with different ambient levels of light by actual measurement. All infants were less than 1000 g birth weight and the brighter nursery had a higher incidence of ROP. However, the nurseries have very different populations (race, illness rates, insurance, etc.) and different physicians and policies involved in their care. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare these outcomes directly and the investigators have decided not to submit the outcomes for publication.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:47:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data available from valid studies in the published literature provide strong evidence that a reduction in light will not reduce the overall incidence of acute retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The data are less conclusive about reduction of poor ROP outcomes because of sample size and the low rates of these severe stages. Additional reports using non-randomised controls do not provide data that are sufficiently free of potential bias to include in the meta-analysis, but in aggregate they also show no reduction in ROP.</P>
<P>If such a relatively simple, inexpensive intervention as reducing light could reduce poor visual outcomes it would be extremely valuable and it has been important to settle the question. The addition of the LIGHT-ROP study (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1998</LINK>) strengthens the conclusion that light reduction is not the solution to preventing ROP vision loss. Critics of this study state that the goggles should have been placed on the infants sooner than within the first 24 hours, but subgroup analysis of the 15% who were goggled within six hours of birth also showed no difference (similarly for the <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1997</LINK> study where infants were also goggled within six hours of birth.)</P>
<P>The confidence intervals around these conclusions are fairly narrow for reducing ROP overall so that a true absolute difference in the incidence rates would be no more than 7%, and the risk ratio is contained within the interval of 0.88 to 1.14. However, the 95% confidence interval for the relative risk difference in poor retinal outcomes is larger because the rates are so low. With the current aggregate sample sizes, the risk ratio could fall between 0.52 and 2.38, although the absolute risk reduction would fall between a 3.1% reduction to a 4.1% increase in absolute rates of poor retinal outcomes.</P>
<P>The question for investigators and funding agencies now is whether to commit further resources to conducting even larger studies of light reduction. The chance that a true effect of light reduction has been missed is now small. Complicating this decision are the other reasons for reducing light exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit, along with noise reduction and other noxious stimuli related to better rest and recovery and growth. These are the subjects of other studies and will complicate future efforts to examine, in isolation, the effects of light reduction.</P>
<P>The number of infants studied to date allows 95% confidence that if there were a true difference being missed, it would be smaller than seven percentage points on a background of 54% of all infants under 2 kg developing ROP based on risk difference.</P>
<P>Future research is unlikely to change the conclusion reached in this analysis: that light reduction to the retina of premature infants does not significantly reduce the incidence or severity of ROP.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:59:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review examined the efficacy of light reduction for preventing retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight infants. Four studies were included with a total of 897 infants. We included three randomised and one quasi-randomised controlled trial. Although the quality of included studies was reasonable, it was not possible to use analytical methods such as subgroup analysis of weight gain or duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, or to explore heterogeneity.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:47:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of our comprehensive search strategy and contact with experts in the field, we are confident that we have mapped all clinical trials comparing any intervention aiming to cover the infant's eyes or to decrease of light falling on the infant's face. Although the evidence on the use of goggles for preventing retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight infants came from only four small trials, the included studies seem to confirm that bright light is not the cause of retinopathy of prematurity.</P>
