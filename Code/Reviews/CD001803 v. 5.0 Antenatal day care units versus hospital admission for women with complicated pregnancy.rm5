<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-05 14:01:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Many women experience complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure, threatened early labour or abnormal and heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Admission to hospital may be necessary but can be disruptive to the mother and her family. Often tests and monitoring are needed so that the condition of the mother and baby can be assessed and treatment can be provided. Sometimes this care can be given in day care units to avoid the need for an overnight stay in hospital. The review compares day care units with hospital admission or routine care. Three trials, involving 504 pregnant women with high blood pressure or preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were included in the review. The findings were that women receiving day care had to make more visits to hospital as outpatients but were less likely to stay in hospital overnight. Care in day units did not seem to affect other outcomes for mothers and babies or increase or reduce interventions in labour; although women in one trial were less likely to have their labours induced if they received day care. Two studies provided evidence that women preferred day care to hospital admission and no women expressed a preference for more inpatient care; most women in both groups felt they had received good care and were satisfied with it.</P>
<P>The aim of antenatal care is to reduce adverse outcomes for mothers and babies but these are relatively infrequent and could not be investigated in this review. A proportion of women attending for day care require subsequent inpatient care, and a range of non-medical considerations such as travelling distance to emergency facilities, social factors and women's emotional wellbeing may lead to admission to hospital. All studies included in the review were carried out as part of evaluations of new services.</P>

<P>Compared with women in the ward/routine care group, women attending day care units were less likely to be admitted to hospital overnight (risk ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.62). The average length of antenatal admission was shorter for women attending for day care, although outpatient attendances were increased for this group. There was evidence from one study that women attending for day care were significantly less likely to undergo induction of labour, but mode of birth was similar for women in both groups. For other outcomes there were no significant differences between groups.The evidence regarding the costs of different types of care was mixed; while the length of antenatal hospital stays were reduced, this did not necessarily translate into reduced health service costs.</P>
<P>While most women tended to be satisfied with whatever care they received, women preferred day care compared with hospital admission.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-05 16:43:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>This review updates and replaces an earlier Cochrane Review on antenatal day care units (<LINK REF="REF-Kroner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Many women experience pregnancy complications that could potentially lead to hospital admission. Dunlop et al have suggested three main reasons why women are admitted to hospital during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 2003</LINK>). First, a woman may need treatment that it would not be feasible to provide outside hospital; second, she may be at risk of her condition worsening over a short period of time, and need emergency facilities close at hand; and third, tests and monitoring may be needed so that the condition of the mother and baby can be assessed and decisions about treatment made. In the latter case, it may be more convenient to women, and more efficient for health service providers, if women do not stay in hospital overnight, but instead attend an antenatal day care unit for initial tests and monitoring. Subsequently, women may be admitted for inpatient care, or discharged home with arrangements for any necessary follow up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Admission to hospital during pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Several large observational surveys have provided information on the numbers of women admitted to hospital during pregnancy and on trends in admission rates. They have also described those women most at risk of, and those complications most likely to result in, hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Adelson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franks-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Population-based studies in the United States (US) have revealed a considerable decline in antenatal hospital admissions during the 1980s and 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>). Between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000 the total rate of (non-delivery) admissions in the US declined from 17.6 to 12.8 per 100 deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>). Similar declines in the rate of admissions during pregnancy have been described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). This decline (which generally mirrors declining overall rates of hospitalisation) has been ascribed to different management rather than reflecting any reduction in the incidence and prevalence of pregnancy complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>). Over the same period, the average length of hospital stay has also declined; and again this is thought to relate to changed management as well as improved therapies, rather than to reduced morbidity.</P>
<P>The complications leading to hospital admission during pregnancy include the onset of preterm labour or threatened preterm labour (accounting for approximately a quarter of admissions); hypertensive disorders including pre-eclampsia; hyperemesis (severe vomiting); antenatal haemorrhage; genito-urinary complications and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Adelson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franks-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zwart-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwart 2008</LINK>). Evidence from observational studies shows that risk of hospitalisation during pregnancy is greater for younger women and those without private health insurance, and that it varies for different ethnic groups, and in different geographical areas and healthcare settings (<LINK REF="REF-Adelson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bacak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antenatal day care units</HEADING>
<P>Admission to hospital during pregnancy is likely to disrupt the lives of women and their families, and may be associated with costs to women (who may lose time at work or need to arrange for the care of other children) and to health service providers. Women may prefer to be cared for in less formal settings and to remain at home overnight, and hospital admission may exacerbate anxiety. On the other hand, women may be reassured by being cared for in hospital, and care in day units may not necessarily lead to cost savings for women or healthcare providers.</P>
<P>During the1980s an alternative to inpatient care for women with pregnancy complications was introduced: the antenatal day assessment unit. In different contexts these facilities have been given different names (e.g. antenatal day care units or obstetric day wards) and their functions vary. Women attending the units frequently undergo the same tests and monitoring as they would receive as inpatients, and treatment may be initiated. Where results of investigations indicate that no immediate inpatient treatment is necessary, women may be discharged home, possibly with arrangements to attend the unit for further monitoring. These facilities were set up with a view to reducing overnight hospital stays, although it was not clear that transferring care to other settings would realise cost savings. Early evaluations suggested that the units were acceptable to women and care providers, and offered the potential for cost reductions compared with inpatient care (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twaddle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twaddle 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twaddle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twaddle 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The organisation of different day units varies; some are staffed by midwives (with medical support) and offer informal facilities with home-like furnishings and facilities for families to accompany women; other facilities resemble more traditional hospital wards which close overnight. Women attending units may stay for several hours during which time tests and monitoring are carried out (including assessment of both mother and baby). Women frequently receive their test results, and subsequent management is arranged, on the same day (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>While hospital admission for pregnancy complications such as hypertension has declined over the past 20 years a significant proportion of women continue to require inpatient care (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1990</LINK>); some women have serious and deteriorating conditions and require immediate admission. A proportion of those attending for day care will require subsequent inpatient care, and a range of non-obstetric considerations (travelling distance from emergency facilities, social factors, and women's emotional wellbeing) may prompt formal admission to hospital. Many units were set up before any formal evaluations by randomised controlled trials had been carried out.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:45:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Using the search strategy we identified four trials for possible inclusion. We excluded one study as the intervention group included women attending antenatal clinics as well as day care units, and separate results were not available for those women attending the day care unit (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included three studies with a total of 504 women. Two of the studies were carried out in the United Kingdom in the 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK>) and one study in Australia between 1998 and 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK>, 55 women with mild to moderate hypertension were randomised to attend a day care unit versus hospital admission. Women attending the day unit had two-hourly blood pressure checks, but it was not clear how long they remained on the unit, and there was no information on how those women admitted as inpatients were managed.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK> also focused on women with hypertension. In this trial, women in the intervention group attended a four-bed day care unit for blood pressure measurements (five readings), urine analysis and a range of other tests. Women were reviewed and then either discharged home with arrangements for any necessary follow up, or admitted to hospital. The comparison group received routine care which varied at the discretion of the referring clinician, and did not necessarily involve inpatient care.</P>
<P>The third and largest of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK>), focused on three pregnancy complications frequently leading to hospital admission: hypertension with proteinuria, hypertension without proteinuria, and preterm premature rupture of the membranes. In this study, the day care unit was compared with admission to a hospital ward. The day care unit was described as "deinstitutionalised" with informal seating and dining areas where women could be accompanied by other family members.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-04-23 10:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One study provided little information on study design (<LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK>). In this study it was not clear how the randomisation sequence was generated, whether there was any attempt to conceal group allocation, or the number of women included in the analyses for different outcomes. Results from this study may be at high risk of bias and should be interpreted with caution. The remaining two studies had adequate allocation concealment and low rates of attrition (at least for those outcomes where data were collected from case notes) (<LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK>). It was not possible to blind women or clinical staff to group allocation in any of these studies, and this may be a source of bias. It is possible that where an intervention represents a new and innovative form of care (that is being evaluated in a trial) clinical staff serving women in the intervention arm may be particularly motivated to provide a high standard of care.</P>

<P>This review aimed to answer questions about length of hospital stay, clinical outcomes, satisfaction with care and costs in day care units compared with routine management or hospital admission.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Antenatal length of stay, admissions and visits (Analysis 1.1 to Analysis 1.5)</HEADING>
<P>All three trials provided some data on antenatal admissions; however, outcomes were measured in a number of ways and we were unable to pool data from trials for most outcomes.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK>, there was a significant reduction in length of antenatal hospital stays for the women in the day care group compared with women receiving routine care (mean difference (MD) of 4.00 fewer days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.96 to -2.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the later study by Turnbull et al (<LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004)</LINK>, the average length of stay was also considerably shorter for women attending the day care unit. The overall length of hospital stay was reported to be less than a day in the day care group (median stay 17 hours, interquartile range (IQR) 5 to 9 hours). This compared with an average stay of more than two days for those in the ward group (median length of antenatal stay 57 hours, IQR 35 to 123 hours). The difference between groups was reported to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Two studies (with 109 women) provided information on the number of women admitted to hospital for at least one night. As might be expected, fewer women in the day care group were admitted to hospital overnight for antenatal complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In contrast, compared with women receiving routine care, women in the day care group made more outpatient visits. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK>, women made more separate visits to hospital (MD 1.5 more visits, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.46). Similarly, in the <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK> study, compared with women admitted to the ward, those in the day care group were reported to have, on average, more separate care "episodes" in the antenatal period (total episodes included hospital admissions, day care unit visits and visits to the emergency department) (MD 0.41, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK> reported that there was no difference in the number of women requiring three successive days' care either in hospital or on the day unit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Maternal morbidity and other maternal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was no maternal mortality in the two studies reporting this outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Maternal morbidity (the development of further complications) in the antenatal period did not differ significantly between the day care and the inpatient groups (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.95).</P>
<P>(In an unpublished paper by <LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK>, it was reported that one woman allocated to the day care group was later admitted to hospital; she then discharged herself, and was later admitted to another hospital with fulminating pre-eclampsia and a placental abruption. We have included this case in the analysis for maternal complications according to randomisation group. It was not clear what the eventual outcomes were for the mother or for the baby.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neonatal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No perinatal mortality was recorded in any of the trials (although the outcome for one baby whose mother had serious morbidity, but who withdrew from the study, was not reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Hooker--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hooker 1986</LINK> study). There were no significant differences between groups for Apgar scores at five minutes (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>), gestational age at delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>), admission to neonatal special care (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>) or birthweight (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was little information on interventions in labour. <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK> reported that there were no significant differences between groups for mode of birth or interventions in labour. Data from the <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK> study partly supported these findings, with similar numbers of women in the day care and comparison group having instrumental and caesarean deliveries (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>). However, in this study, fewer women in the day care group had their labours induced compared with women receiving routine care (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83). (Overall, the numbers of women undergoing induction or augmentation, or both, were similar for both study groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK> study; separate figures for inductions were not reported (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>).)<BR/>
</P>
<P>The length of postnatal stay for women randomised to day care versus routine or hospital care was similar (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK> the overall length of stay (including antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal hospital care) for mothers and babies was significantly shorter in the day care group than in the inpatient group (MD 1.31 fewer days, 95% CI -2.36 to -0.26) but this did not translate into any overall reduction in health service costs for women in this group compared with the ward group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK>, unpublished data revealed that compared with hospital admission, day care was potentially cheaper for both health service providers and for women. However, the authors noted that not all savings are realisable; many costs remain fixed, unused resources may not be redeployed, and the existence of an alternative form of care (day care unit) may exert new demand (e.g. if clinicians do not use the same threshold for referral for day care as for hospital admission).</P>
<P>Patient views on their care were collected in two studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK> study, five comparison group and two day unit women felt they had spent too long in hospital (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>). When asked about care in any subsequent pregnancy, 42 of the 45 respondents said they would have been prepared to attend outpatients at least twice a week to avoid hospital admission, and 17 women would have been prepared to attend every day to avoid admission. No women expressed a preference for more inpatient care. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK>, most women in both groups felt they had received good care and were satisfied with it. However, at four days after delivery, overall, significantly more women in the hospital group expressed dissatisfaction with their care compared with those randomised to the day unit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). For other measures of dissatisfaction measured at four days, differences between groups were not significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>) although in a detailed breakdown of psychosocial outcomes at four days after delivery, the authors report that 12 of 28 items examining satisfaction with care favoured the day care group, and for other items there were no significant differences between groups.</P>

<P>One study recorded maternal complications at the birth and in the postnatal period, and again there were no significant differences between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:52:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Women attending day care units were less likely to be admitted to hospital and, therefore, average length of antenatal admissions were shorter, although outpatient attendances were increased for this group. For most other outcomes there were few differences between groups. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were similar. There was some evidence that women attending for day care were less likely to undergo induction of labour. Changes in the rate of induction of labour are not simple to interpret; the decision to induce may be taken to reduce prolonged observation in hospital and the reduction in length of stay for women in the day care group may thus be underestimated if more women in the hospital group are induced. However, other outcomes including mode of birth were similar for women in both groups, and there were no significant differences in infant birthweight. Length of stay for intrapartum and postnatal care were similar for the two groups. It was not clear that reductions in hospital admissions in the antenatal period resulted in overall cost savings for health service providers.</P>
<P>While most women tended to be satisfied with whatever care they received, women appeared to prefer day care to hospital admission.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:56:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Interpreting the findings of this review is not straightforward. The review includes only three trials, and all these were carried out as part of evaluations of new service developments, with possibly new facilities. This could affect the results in different ways. First, when there has been major investment in an innovative new service, it may be difficult for clinical staff and investigators to maintain equipoise. The clinical staff recruited to serve in new services may be particularly enthusiastic; especially if the service represents a new innovation in the care offered by a particular professional group (e.g. a midwifery-led day care unit). Further, staff that are aware that they are part of a trial evaluating the very service that they are providing may not offer 'routine' care. Both of these may increase the quality of care in the new unit. Conversely, however, staff may not have complete confidence in a new service in which the intensity of care is reduced. This may lead to them regressing to traditional forms of care for the more serious cases. In the <LINK REF="STD-Tuffnell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tuffnell 1992</LINK> study, there were a number of protocol deviations as some clinical staff preferred to refer women to the day care unit rather than admitting them as inpatients, irrespective of randomisation. Although in this review analysis was by randomisation group, these protocol violations make the results more difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>The aim of antenatal management of hypertension (or preterm premature rupture of membranes) is to reduce the frequency of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. These, however, are relatively infrequent even in this high-risk group. In <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 2004</LINK>, for example, an Apgar score of under seven at five minutes was only reported in 5.1% of women whilst severe hypertension in labour was only seen in 6.6%. Even for these relatively 'soft' outcomes, the studies in this meta-analysis are hugely underpowered with only 26% and 33% power to detect a reduction of 50% in the rate of low Apgar and severe hypertension respectively (at a 95% significance level). With such small numbers, therefore, it would be unlikely for us to see a statistically significant difference unless the difference were very large. This gives further reason to interpret these results with care.</P>
<P>Day care management in obstetrics and in other medical specialties is now widespread. Observational studies on antenatal day care units have supported the findings of this review in as much as they have suggested that day care offers the potential for cost savings. However, savings are only realised if resources are redeployed and day care does not create new demand. Clinical staff may have lower thresholds for referring women to day care units than for ward admission. Further, management of a discrete episode of care in the antenatal period accounts for only a small part of overall cost. Reduced length of stay on one occasion will only result in cost savings if there is an overall reduction in health service utilisation including, for example, the use of out-of-hours, community-based health services (which was not reported in these trials). Interpreting cost data is further complicated by the wide variation in the cost of care (and in length of hospital stay in the antenatal and postnatal periods) for individual women and their babies; a small number of women and babies may incur very high costs and this may mean that "average" cost data may not be particularly informative.</P>
<P>The results in this review concerning women's views about their care are supported by findings from another non-randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Twaddle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twaddle 1995</LINK>) which found 57% of women prepared to attend day care five times a week to avoid a seven-day admission and all women were prepared to come at least once. However, some women may prefer hospital admission, and it may be important to offer women choice about the way their pregnancy complication is managed; this may apply especially to those women who have experienced a poor outcome in a previous pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:56:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Two of the three studies included in the review had adequate allocation concealment; however, blinding of women and service providers is not possible for this type of intervention and, as we have discussed above, this may lead to some bias in the conduct of trials. This is especially true when a new innovative service is being introduced. In both the intervention and comparison groups, the type of care given in the three studies varied and this means that caution is needed in the interpretation of any pooled results. Further, each trial measured different outcomes in different ways. Outcomes relating to length of stay are particularly difficult to interpret.</P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:56:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>As day care units are now an accepted part of antenatal services in many areas, it is difficult to carry out further randomised studies. However, the trials included in the review included little information on psychological outcomes for women. Qualitative studies have examined the impact on women of hospital admission during pregnancy, but there has been little work on anxiety and depression for women attending day care units, or on those aspects of service provision which are associated with optimum outcomes or are preferred by women. Such research could underpin further service development in this area.</P>

<P>Intervention group: patients referred to the day unit were seen the morning after referral. 5 BP readings were made; urine was checked for protein; platelet count and serum urate concentration were measured; and a cardiotocograph was done. Doppler waveform analyses were done if considered necessary by the clinician. After each visit the woman was reviewed, and further visits were arranged according to perceived clinical need; either discharged back to clinic, followed up in the day unit, or admitted to hospital.<BR/>Comparison group: patients in the control group were managed according to the judgement and established practice of the referring clinician. This did not necessarily entail admission to the hospital. In the experimental group, 16 women were admitted to hospital without further review, 5 were reviewed by the community midwife 48-96 hours later and 3 were given appointments to the next antenatal clinic. 3 patients allocated to the control group were referred to the day unit.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-05-18 14:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A record was kept of the woman's blood pressure, weight and stage of gestation at referral, and the action taken after randomisation. Outpatient attendance and admissions and the proportion of time in hospital were recorded prospectively from day of entry to the study to delivery. Clinical complications, the method of management, and labour and delivery details were recorded. Patient satisfaction was assessed by a confidential postal questionnaire sent to all women 4 to 6 weeks after delivery.</P>

<P>This study compared inpatient versus outpatient management of raised diastolic blood pressure. The inpatient group were admitted on the day of recruitment to the study or on the next day. The intervention group included 2 groups of women who were managed in different ways: (i) women were referred to a day care unit where they had a protocol for monitoring women's condition including urine analysis and blood pressure checks and 4 hours' bed rest, OR (ii) women were assessed in the antenatal clinic which had no facilities for bed rest, cardiotography or ultrasound. Women in both groups were given urine testing equipment to use on discharge home. The study was excluded as separate results were not provided for women attending the day care unit. It was not clear how many women in the outpatient group attended the day care unit or whether women in the two outpatient groups had similar characteristics.</P>
