<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-14 16:23:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Mooren's ulcer is inflammation that occurs at the edge of the cornea (clear part of the front of the eye). Its cause is unknown. It is very painful and can or will lead to loss of vision if untreated. It occurs worldwide and affects all age groups. It is diagnosed by excluding other causes of ulcerations at the edge of the cornea such as chronic inflammation of the joints due to rheumatoid arthritis. Mooren's ulcer can be treated both medically and surgically. Medical treatment includes the use of drugs such as steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. Surgical methods include resection of the conjunctiva (the thin clear tissue that covers the surface of the eye) from the cornea, removal of dead cornea tissue and cornea transplant. We set out to determine the best available intervention for the treatment of Mooren&#8217;s ulcer by looking for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one form of treatment to another; and treatment versus no treatment. The electronic database searches did not find any RCTs on the treatment of Mooren&#8217;s ulcer. This review recommends the need for well conducted RCTs for both medical and surgical interventions for Mooren&#8217;s ulcer. These trials should look at outcomes such as number of participants that healed against those that did not, what percentage of area healed and the speed at which healing took place.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Mooren's ulcer is a chronic, painful peripheral ulcer of the cornea. Its cause is unknown but it can or will lead to loss of vision if untreated. Severe pain is common in patients with Mooren's ulcer and the eye(s) may be intensely reddened, inflamed and photophobic, with tearing. The disease is rare in the northern hemisphere but more common in southern and central Africa, China and the Indian subcontinent. There are a number of treatments used such as anti-inflammatory drugs (steroidal and non-steroidal), cytotoxic drugs (topical and systemic), conjunctivectomy and cornea debridement (superficial keratectomy). There is no evidence to show which is the most effective amongst these treatment modalities.</P>

<P>We found no evidence in the form of RCTs to assess the treatment effect for the various interventions for Mooren's ulcer. High quality RCTs that compare medical or surgical interventions across different demographics are needed.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:35:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:35:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Mooren's ulcer is a chronic, painful, peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) (peripheral ulcer of the cornea). It is bilateral in approximately one-third of cases and the cause is unknown.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The prevalence of Mooren's ulcer and the blindness caused by it worldwide is unknown. The disease is rare in the northern hemisphere but more common in southern and central Africa, China and the Indian subcontinent (<LINK REF="REF-Tuft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuft 2003</LINK>). It is more common in males (1.3:1) than females (1.6:1) and very rare in children (<LINK REF="REF-Tuft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuft 2003</LINK>). In a three-year retrospective review in a hospital in Nigeria, amongst 18 people (25 eyes) with Mooren's ulcer, the age range was 12 to 42 years (average 27.9 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Alhassan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhassan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence varies from one case per year seen in specialist clinics in Europe and North America, to between one in 350 and one in 2200 clinic visits in India and Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Zegans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zegans 1998</LINK>). A large case series from China (715 eyes treated in 36 years) put the incidence at 0.03% of the study population (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Although the cause is unknown, it has been suggested that there is a genetic as well as an environmental basis for the disease. The likely environmental factors include antecedent history of accidental trauma or surgery and exposure to viral and parasitic infections. However, an increase in the rate of hepatitis C infection has not been found in patients from India with Mooren's ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Tuft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuft 2003</LINK>). An association with helminthiasis (intestinal worm infestation) has also been noted, but the disease can develop in the absence of helminthiasis. Even where helminthiasis is endemic, Mooren's ulcer is still rare (<LINK REF="REF-Tuft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuft 2003</LINK>). Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) can confer susceptibility to several autoimmune disorders and in Asian and black African patients the presence of HLA-DR17 or DQ2 (histocompatibility antigens) may confer susceptibility to Mooren's ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1993</LINK> also reported increased expression of HLA DR in patients with the disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Classification</HEADING>
<P>There are various forms of classifications of the disease. A recent and more often used classification groups Mooren's ulcer into three distinct types on the basis of clinical features, fluorescein angiographic evidence of capillary closure or leakage and response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1997</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Unilateral Mooren's ulceration (UM) is a painful progressive corneal ulceration in elderly patients and is associated with non-perfusion of the superficial vascular plexus of the anterior segment.</LI>
<LI>Bilateral aggressive Mooren's ulceration (BAM) occurs in young patients and progresses circumferentially then centrally in the cornea. There is vascular leakage and new vessel formation extending into the base of the ulcer.</LI>
<LI>Bilateral indolent Mooren's ulceration (BIM) usually occurs in middle-aged patients and presents with progressive peripheral corneal guttering in both eyes, with little inflammatory response. There is no change from normal vascular architecture except an extension of new vessels into the ulcer.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Another common classification is based on laterality and age of onset. The disease is grouped into two types.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A unilateral type common amongst older age groups with same sex distribution, and slow progression.</LI>
<LI>A type that occurs mostly in Africa, as a bilateral rapidly progressive disease, that is less responsive to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wilhelmus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilhelmus 2001</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical manifestation</HEADING>
<P>Severe pain is common in Mooren's ulcer and the eye(s) may be intensely reddened, inflamed and photophobic, with tearing. The disease is characterised by a crescent-shaped, peripheral corneal ulcer, with an extensively undermined central edge that results in the characteristic 'overhanging' edge of the cornea (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilhelmus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilhelmus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1982</LINK>). The ulcer typically progresses with an anterior stromal yellow-white infiltrate 2 mm to 3 mm from the limbus at the advancing margin of the ulcer, often in the interpalpebral zone (<LINK REF="REF-Kanski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuft 2003</LINK>). An overlying linear epithelial defect then develops often at the central margin. This is followed by progressive stromal melting, which affects the deeper stroma first and subsequently the anterior stroma. The ulcer progresses circumferentially and centrally. A re-epithelialised, conjunctivalised, thinned cornea may remain.</P>
<P>Chronic Mooren's ulcer ultimately results in a central island of hazy stromal tissue with severe peripheral thinning. Topography demonstrates significant irregular astigmatism and peripheral steepening. No scleral involvement occurs, although associated conjunctival and episcleral inflammation may be seen. Visual loss as a result of irregular corneal astigmatism and scarring is common.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical grading</HEADING>
<P>Mooren's ulcer can be graded as follows (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2005</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>The extent of corneal thinning in one or more quadrants, subdivided into a) mild - thinning affecting less than 25% of corneal circumference; b) moderate - thinning affecting 25% to 50% of corneal circumference; and c) severe - thinning affecting more than 50% of corneal circumference.</LI>
<LI>Impending corneal perforation.</LI>
<LI>Corneal perforation of more than 2 mm.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Mooren's ulcer is diagnosed by its typical clinical features as described above (in 'Clinical manifestation') and exclusion of any systemic disease. This distinguishes it from other, more common types of PUK associated with collagen vascular disease, which must be excluded in order to diagnose Mooren's ulcer.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:30:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Some investigators advocate 'the stepladder approach' in the treatment of aggressive Mooren's ulcer. This includes medical (local and systemic) and surgical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1984</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Medical treatment</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Local</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that initial treatment should be with topical corticosteroids, followed by limbal conjunctival resection if the inflammation is not controlled. Topical cyclosporine 1% drops have been used in some cases (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1993</LINK>). In addition, bandage contact lenses (to reduce discomfort and promote epithelial healing); tissue adhesive; subconjunctival heparin injections; artificial tears and topical collagenase inhibitors, such as acetylcysteine (Mucomyst 10%) and L-cysteine 0.2 molar have been used. Lecinthinated superoxide dismutase use has also been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Shimmura-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shimmura 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Systemic</HEADING>
<P>Immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine may be initiated if treatment with conjunctival resection fails, and may be considered earlier in bilateral cases or in cases where the disease is advanced at first examination, with extensive corneal thinning (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1985</LINK>). Systemic immunosuppressive treatment of the more aggressive bilateral disease has included the use of oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, and methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1984</LINK>). The use of high-dose cyclosporine A has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1985</LINK>). Plasma exchange has also been tried. Systemic interferon alfa-2b has been used in the treatment of patients positive for the hepatitis C virus who have Mooren's ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Moazami-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moazami 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1994</LINK>). Two case reports showed favourable responses to monoclonal antibodies campath- 1H and infliximab (<LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Hoek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Hoek 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Surgical interventions include conjunctival resection, lamellar keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty, delimiting keratotomy, conjunctival flap and patch grafts of periosteum or fascia lata (<LINK REF="REF-Kinoshita-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinoshita 1991</LINK>). Some investigators advocate "removal of the presumed antigenic corneal source (central lamellar keratectomy)" in an attempt to mediate a more rapid resolution of the inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although initial corneal surgery is usually contra-indicated, some authors have reported good results with a primary lamellar keratoplasty combined with topical cyclosporine A. Using this regimen <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK> achieved a cure of 74% for the first procedure, and a final cure rate of 95%.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-12 13:19:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The local and systemic immunosuppressives act by mitigating the immune response to inciting antibodies while the surgical interventions like conjunctival resection act by preventing the delivery of immune complexes to the cornea stroma.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The multiplicity of therapeutic strategies employed for Mooren's ulcer underscores the relative lack of knowledge about effective treatment. The outcome of management is difficult to determine because of the different treatments and different patient characteristics. Thus, it is imperative to identify the most effective modality or modalities for the treatment of this condition, for different patient characteristics, so that informed decisions can be made for optimal management of the disease.</P>

<P>Two authors will independently assess the methodological quality of studies for inclusion in the review. We will use the criteria for assessing risk of bias, as stated in Chapter 8 of <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), for each of the following domains.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We will calculate and pool risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data (such as healed/not healed). For continuous data we will calculate mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs for each included study and pool the data to derive the mean difference (MD). If the scales vary, we will calculate and pool the standardised mean difference (SMD). If possible, we will calculate a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for time-to-event data.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>If the unit of analysis differs from the unit of randomisation (for example analysis by eyes but randomisation done per individual) then we will ensure that the correct denominator is used for analysis, or else we will adjust for the non-independence between the two eyes.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We plan to contact primary authors for missing data. If we do not get a response from the primary author, we will address missing data by using replacement values (assuming that the data were missed at random and that the missing values signify poor outcomes). We will perform sensitivity analysis using various assumptions.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity using a P value of  less than 0.10 to determine significant heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test). We will use a random-effects model and subgroup analysis to address significant heterogeneity.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We plan to assess for reporting bias if at least 10 papers are included in the review. We also plan to include unpublished studies. We have not restricted the electronic database searches by language (see '<LINK TAG="SEARCH_METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Search methods for identification of studies</LINK>'). We will also examine the funnel plot for asymmetry by visual inspection. For continuous data we will use linear regression of the intervention effect estimate on their standard error to test for funnel plot asymmetry. For dichotomous data we will use linear regression of the log odds ratio (OR) on its standard error by the inverse of the variance of the log OR. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>If meta-analysis is deemed appropriate we will combine studies using a fixed-effect model where there are three or less studies, or a random-effects model where there are more than three studies.</P>
<P>If meta-analysis is not possible, we will report included studies in a narrative synthesis. We will group the studies according to study design and intervention with consideration of variation in recruited participants, outcome measures and methodological validity.

<P>The electronic searches did not find any prospective RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.

<P>A combination of these strategies has been used in many of the studies cited above. <A HREF="file:///c:\documents%20and%20settings\appdata\local\microsoft\windows\temporary%20internet%20files\low\content.ie5\krs8srjt\interventions_for_mooren's_ulcer%5b1%5d.htm#std-chen-2000">Chen 2000</A> used a combination of conjunctival excision, lamellar keratoplasty and topical 1% cyclosporine A with some success.

The classification is based on the degree of cornea thinning at time of commencement of treatment.</P>
<P>Definition of success also seems to vary in the literature. Some studies used &#8216;healed&#8217;(<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiev-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tiev 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1993</LINK>) while others used 'visual acuity' (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1987</LINK>). Failure was defined as progression of corneal melting leading to perforation and loss of the eye.</P>
<P>Any RCT design for the measurement of treatment effect for Mooren&#8217;s ulcer needs to take into consideration the above factors i.e. combination of modalities, step ladder approach and clear definitions of outcome measures such as visual acuity, healing, cornea thinning/perforation, time to healing and adverse events. Case definition has to be clearly stated including how the other causes of PUK were ruled out. All interventions compared should be well defined. We suggest any RCT on interventions for Mooren's ulcer should consider the following points.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Participants' selection</HEADING>
<P>Selection of participants must ensure that the mechanism for exclusion of PUK from systemic conditions is followed. The panel of tests to be carried out will include the following: antinuclear antibody (ANA); antiphospholipid antibodies; rheumatoid factor (Rh); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); serum antibodies to hookworm; C-reactive protein (CRP); and stool microscopy for hookworm (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Gaag-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Gaag 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelefsky-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelefsky 2007</LINK>). Adequate concealment of allocation must also be insured. The <LINK REF="REF-Wilhelmus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilhelmus 2001</LINK> classification of Mooren's ulcer is suggested in any planned RCT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Assessment</HEADING>
<P>Masking of participants and the care giver should be effected in trials involving use of drugs.</P>
<P>Adequate masking of the assessors needs to be made for all interventions. This may easily be effected by assessing quality photographs of the ulcer instead of the patient.</P>
<P>The following intervention combinations can be used in an RCT on Mooren's ulcer treatment: topical immunosuppressives (topical steroids, topical cyclosporine and topical cyclophosphamide); systemic immunosuppressives (steroids, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide); and conjunctivectomy with superficial keratectomy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-14 15:59:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There are no RCTs available to measure the effectiveness of the various modalities for the treatment of Mooren's ulcer. For now the routine practice of selective treatment or step ladder approach, judged clinically to be most appropriate for the patient characteristics, will have to continue.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:30:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Mooren's ulcer is potentially a blinding condition. High-quality RCTs are needed comparing the various treatment modalities (medical or surgical) for the treatment of Mooren's ulcer among the different demographic status of patients. Such studies should make use of various outcome measures such as (healed versus not healed, percentage of area healed, speed of healing etc.) as well as ensuring high quality randomisation and data analysis as highlighted in this review.</P>
