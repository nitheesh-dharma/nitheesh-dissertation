<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Acupuncture is a treatment based on ancient Chinese medicine in which fine needles or pressure is applied at certain sites in the body for therapeutic purposes. We wanted to know whether acupuncture is effective in improving the recovery of daily activities, movement, and quality of life in people who had experienced a stroke more than one month previously.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Stroke is a major cause of death in the world and can also cause severe disability. Acupuncture is a relatively simple, inexpensive and safe treatment that has been used in China for hundreds of years and is increasingly practiced in some Western countries. However, it remains uncertain whether the existing evidence is sufficiently reliable to recommend the routine use of acupuncture.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 31 studies to July 2015 for inclusion in the review. These included a total of 2257 participants who had had a stroke more than one month previously. They all investigated acupuncture aimed at promoting recovery compared with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture. Outcomes included measures of daily activities (activities of daily living), neurological function, movement, cognition, depression, swallowing, pain, and quality of life. Most of the studies (29/31) were conducted in China; the studies varied considerably with respect to the time of stroke, specific techniques used, and the frequency of acupuncture.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found some evidence that acupuncture improved activities of daily living and a number of aspects of neurological function. However, these conclusions were based on studies with low quality evidence. No serious side effects were reported and there was no information on the effects of acupuncture on death or the need for institutional care.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>It proved difficult to reliably determine the quality of the evidence because of poor reporting of study characteristics. Therefore, we have described most conclusions as having low or very low quality evidence.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:40:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the second most common cause of death in the world and in China it has now become the main cause of death. It is also a main cause of adult disability and dependency. Acupuncture for stroke has been used in China for hundreds of years and is increasingly practiced in some Western countries. This is an update of the Cochrane review originally published in 2006 .</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-06-06 08:52:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy in people with subacute and chronic stroke. We intended to test the following hypotheses: 1) acupuncture can reduce the risk of death or dependency in people with subacute and chronic stroke at the end of treatment and at follow-up; 2) acupuncture can improve neurological deficit and quality of life after treatment and at the end of follow-up; 3) acupuncture can reduce the number of people requiring institutional care; and 4) acupuncture is not associated with any intolerable adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-31 13:07:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <I>Cochrane Library</I> 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2015, Ovid), EMBASE (1980 to July 2015, Ovid), CINAHL (1982 to July 2015, EBSCO), and AMED (1985 to July 2015, Ovid). We also searched the following four Chinese medical databases: China Biological Medicine Database (July 2015); Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (July 2015); China National Infrastructure (July 2015), and Wan Fang database (July 2015).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-05-16 11:33:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Truly randomised unconfounded clinical trials among people with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, in the subacute or chronic stage, comparing acupuncture involving needling with placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality, extracted and cross-checked the data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-03 15:40:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 31 trials with a total of 2257 participants in the subacute or chronic stages of stroke. The methodological quality of most of the included trials was not high. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low based on the assessment by the system of Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).</P>
<P>Two trials compared real acupuncture plus baseline treatment with sham acupuncture plus baseline treatment. There was no evidence of differences in the changes of motor function and quality of life between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture for people with stroke in the convalescent stage.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine trials compared acupuncture plus baseline treatment versus baseline treatment alone. Compared with no acupuncture, for people with stroke in the convalescent phase, acupuncture had beneficial effects on the improvement of dependency (activity of daily living) measured by Barthel Index (nine trials, 616 participants; mean difference (MD) 9.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.34 to 14.05; GRADE very low), global neurological deficiency (seven trials, 543 participants; odds ratio (OR) 3.89, 95% CI 1.78 to 8.49; GRADE low), and specific neurological impairments including motor function measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (four trials, 245 participants; MD 6.16, 95% CI 4.20 to 8.11; GRADE low), cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (five trials, 278 participants; MD 2.54, 95% CI 0.03 to 5.05; GRADE very low), depression measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale (six trials, 552 participants; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.28 to -1.87; GRADE very low), swallowing function measured by drinking test (two trials, 200 participants; MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.08 to -0.14; GRADE very low), and pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (two trials, 118 participants; MD -2.88, 95% CI -3.68 to -2.09; GRADE low). Sickness caused by acupuncture and intolerance of pain at acupoints were reported in a few participants with stroke in the acupuncture groups. No data on death, the proportion of people requiring institutional care or requiring extensive family support, and all-cause mortality were available in all included trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:44:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>From the available evidence, acupuncture may have beneficial effects on improving dependency, global neurological deficiency, and some specific neurological impairments for people with stroke in the convalescent stage, with no obvious serious adverse events. However, most included trials were of inadequate quality and size. There is, therefore, inadequate evidence to draw any conclusions about its routine use. Rigorously designed, randomised, multi-centre, large sample trials of acupuncture for stroke are needed to further assess its effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:45:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world (<LINK REF="REF-GBD2013-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD2013 2015</LINK>). In the USA, stroke accounted for about one of every 19 deaths in 2010. On average, someone dies of stroke every four minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Go-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 2014</LINK>). In 2013, stroke has become the leading cause of death in cities and rural areas in China (<LINK REF="REF-GBD2013-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD2013 2015</LINK>). Although age-standardised rates of stroke mortality have decreased worldwide in the past two decades, the absolute numbers of people with first stroke (16.9 million), stroke survivors (33 million), stroke-related deaths (5.9 million), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost (102 million) in 2010 were still high and had significantly increased since 1990 (68%, 84%, 26%, and 12% increase, respectively), imposing a great burden on families and communities in low-income and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2014</LINK>). Despite considerable research efforts on multiple treatment modalities, there is still no single rehabilitation intervention demonstrated unequivocally to aid recovery. This reality drives people to search for other modalities of treatment in an attempt to further improve the outcome of stroke rehabilitation, such as acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Acupuncture is one of the main modalities of treatment in traditional Chinese medicine and can be traced back more than 3000 years in China (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1996</LINK>). Being a relatively simple, inexpensive, and safe treatment compared with other conventional interventions, acupuncture has been well accepted by Chinese patients and is widely used to improve motor, sensation, speech, and other neurological functions in people with stroke. As a therapeutic intervention, acupuncture is also increasingly practiced in some Western countries (<LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salom_x002d_Moreno-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Salom-Moreno 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaechter-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schaechter 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wayne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wayne 2005</LINK>). .</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:45:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Many studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses, including circulatory and biochemical effects. These responses can occur locally or close to the site of application, or at a distance. They are mediated mainly by sensory neurons to many structures within the central nervous system. This can lead to activation of pathways affecting various physiological systems in the brain as well as in the periphery (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magnusson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magnusson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>
<U>)</U>. In summary, possible mechanisms of the effects of acupuncture on neurological conditions include stimulation of neuronal cell proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2008</LINK>), facilitation of neural plasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Ren-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ren 2008</LINK>), reduction of the post-ischaemic inflammatory reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009a</LINK>), and prevention of neuronal apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008a</LINK>). </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There are a large number of studies of the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in stroke rehabilitation published in the world, especially in China, but not all demonstrate a beneficial effect on stroke rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sze-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zhan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2015</LINK>). Many systematic reviews of trials of acupuncture in stroke rehabilitation have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopwood 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li--2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sze-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2010a</LINK>). These reviews, however, included mainly trials with stroke patients in either the acute, or subacute, and chronic stages. Some reviews only focused on specific types of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2011a</LINK>), or needling (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>), or neurologic deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Long-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2011a</LINK>). Knowing that a large number of clinical studies had been completed since this review was originally published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>), we aimed to conduct an up-to-date systematic review of publications regardless of subtype of stroke, or needling, or neurologic deficits.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to systematically analyse all the randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for subacute and chronic stroke to provide the best available evidence to inform clinical practice and further research planning on stroke treatment.</P>

<P>We planned to undertake subgroup analyses to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, interventions, and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to the type and severity of stroke. Post-stroke neurological recovery is known to be obvious within three months, especially post-stroke motor recovery, and is unlikely beyond six months, so heterogeneity in treatments could be related to times to start of treatment. Mixing patients with interval from stroke onset of less than three months, three to six months, and more than six months in one sample would make the assessment of the efficacy of an intervention methodologically unsound. If appropriate data were available, we planned a subgroup analysis to compare participants with different times to start of treatment (within three months, three to six months, and after six months) using the method outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>

One trial evaluated the effect of acupuncture on the improvement of global neurological function measured by the NFDS at the end of one month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2013a</LINK>).

<P>Seven trials with a total of 543 participants measured improvement of global neurological deficit after acupuncture treatment by using categorical approaches only (CSRS 1 and CSRS 2) rather than continuous scales, for example changes of global neurological deficit score (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lun-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lun 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2015</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity among the seven trials (I² = 55%), which was possibly due to differences in outcome measurements used, times of evaluation from stroke onset, and types of stroke. This means that the overall estimate of treatment effect is not reliable. Hence, the apparent improvement of global neurological deficit in the acupuncture group compared with the control group should be interpreted with caution (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.78 to 8.49; participants = 543; studies = 7; I² = 55%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although funnel plot asymmetry has long been equated with publication bias, the funnel plot should be seen as a generic means of displaying small-study effects<I>. </I>Small-study effects may be due to factors other than publication bias, such as poor methodological quality leading to spuriously inflated effects in smaller studies, true heterogeneity, artefactual, and chance (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:48:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 31 trials in this review, with a total of 2257 participants in the subacute or chronic stage of stroke. Two trials were conducted outside China (<LINK REF="STD-Chou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chou 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naeser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Naeser 1992</LINK>) and the remaining 29 trials were conducted in China. The present review on acupuncture for stroke is also not representative of different racial groups.</P>
<P>The results revealed the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Compared with no acupuncture, for people with stroke in the subacute or chronic stage, acupuncture may have a beneficial effect on improving dependency (activities of daily living); global neurological deficiency; and specific neurological impairments including motor function, cognitive function, depression, swallowing function, pain, and spasticity.</LI>
<LI>Acupuncture was not superior to sham acupuncture or no acupuncture on improving the quality of life in people with stroke in the subacute or chronic stage.</LI>
<LI>There were no serious adverse events reported in people with stroke in the convalescent stage using acupuncture.</LI>
<LI>Currently there is no evidence from the included RCTs for the effect of acupuncture on death, requiring institutional care, and all-cause mortality in people with stroke in the subacute or chronic stage.</LI>
</OL>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:51:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In this systematic review, a substantial number of the included studies were conducted in China and were published in Chinese. Our electronic searching successfully identified studies for which an abstract was available in Chinese, as well as a number of studies based on English titles. However, we believe it is likely that we will not have identified all relevant Chinese trials, in particular those for which only English titles were available and those not published in journals included in the electronic databases that we searched. The asymmetric funnel plot further proved that there was existing publication bias in this systematic review (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many of the relevant trials that we included were published only as brief reports. This was frequently the case for studies published in Chinese, for which published versions were often less than two pages long. Although we contacted study authors, when possible, to confirm study eligibility, we did not have the time or resources to contact all study authors for further information on trial design or study results. Thus, in general the completeness of study information is low, resulting in a high number of studies for which risk of bias is classed as 'unclear'.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>The studies included In this review were predominantly conducted in China, so the review is not representative of different racial groups. The type and severity of stroke may alter the effects of acupuncture on people with stroke. From the available information, it was not possible to perform pre-specified subgroup analyses comparing people with different severities of stroke, and different times to start of treatment after stroke. This was due firstly, to the limited number studies for the specified outcomes, secondly, to only some of the included trials reporting data on severity, and thirdly, to most trials not clearly defining the interval between stroke onset and the start of the intervention treatment, and including participants with a mix of different intervals from stroke onset to start of intervention treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Properties of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The quality of acupuncture treatment is closely related to its effectiveness. Misleading results may have occurred if the treatment schedules were inadequate or administered by unskilled practitioners. However, information on the experience and training of the acupuncturists who gave the treatments was available in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chou 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, the acupuncture techniques, the number of acupoints, the number and duration of sessions, and the duration of the intervention period varied across trials. Some trials reported that the acupuncture points, the number of sessions, and the duration of treatment were individualised according to the practical conditions in each stroke patient. From the scarce description of treatment in all trials, it is difficult to evaluate if the acupuncture treatment was valid or not. The consensus of an international group of experienced acupuncturists and researchers was that clinical trials of acupuncture must use an optimal form of treatment, defined by examining standard texts and by surveying and consulting experts, and must be reported by using Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in ClinicalTrials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) (<LINK REF="REF-Hugh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugh 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Because post-stroke neurological recovery is known to be obvious within three months, especially post-stroke motor recovery, and unlikely beyond six months, mixing people with interval from stroke onset of less than three months, three to six months, and more than six months in one sample would make the assessment of the efficacy of an intervention methodologically unsound. From the available information, it was not possible to perform pre-specified subgroup analyses comparing people with different times to start of treatment (within three months, three to six months, and after six months) for each outcome. This was due to the limited amount of data, the varied outcome measurements, or both, in this systematic review.</P>
<P>The long-term goal of treatment for stroke is to reduce mortality and disability, and ultimately to prolong survival and improve quality of life. Data available from the included trials were mainly secondary outcomes. There was a lack of data from RCTs on clinically relevant outcomes at long-term follow up, such as mortality and quality of life. The lack of reliable evidence on primary outcomes meant that we were unable to draw conclusions about the influence of acupuncture on stroke.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Of the 31 included trials with a total of 2257 participants in the convalescent phase of stroke, only one participant was reported to have suffered from bleeding and three participants were reported to have suffered from intolerance to pain at acupoints. There were no serious adverse events reported. From the available evidence, it appears that acupuncture is a safe treatment when used for people with stroke. However, it should be noted that this result was based on insufficient information from five trials with a small number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2014</LINK>). Most trials in this systematic review did not report whether any adverse events relevant to acupuncture were apparent in their participants. The reasons for insufficient reporting of adverse events were possibly as follows. Firstly, Chinese practitioners perceive acupuncture as free of side effects, secondly, because these are rare events, data from RCTs will almost never be sufficient to prove or disprove a causal relationship between a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy and a rare adverse event, and thirdly, study authors reported positive effects without reporting adverse events as well. However, some studies demonstrated that serious adverse events have been associated with acupuncture, such as infections (HIV, hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis) caused by non-sterile needles, or complications (pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) caused by tissue trauma, but the incidence of adverse events was unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:48:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The current available evidence shows that acupuncture may have beneficial effects on the improvement of dependency, global neurological deficiency, and specific neurological deficiency in some dimensions. Unfortunately due to low methodological quality with regard to methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of assessment of most included trials, and probable publication bias, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of acupuncture for people with stroke in the convalescent stage. The general low methodological quality of the included trials of acupuncture for stroke prohibited meaningful sensitivity analyses to illuminate the robustness of the results of the review to the exclusion of those trials with inadequate methodology. It was also not possible to perform sensitivity analysis to confirm the robustness of the results of the review to the exclusion of Chinese trials, because only two non-Chinese trials were included. However, this systematic review provides comprehensive and updated information on the effects of acupuncture for stroke in the convalescent stage for clinical practice. Therefore, further research on acupuncture for stroke is worthwhile in future.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-06 13:48:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The major limitations of this review are related to the weakness inherent in the available published literature on acupuncture for stroke. While most studies reported global and specific neurological deficit results, the measurement of the outcomes varied considerably across trials. The combined results from studies with such wide variation were unreliable. Furthermore, many studies did not provide detailed information on the severity of the disease, the exact time of starting the acupuncture treatment, the modalities of acupuncture technique and acupuncturist's background, and possible adverse effects relevant to acupuncture treatment. This brings the generalisability of the results into question.</P>
<P>Another limitation of this systematic review is that publication bias might be present, as indicated by the asymmetric funnel plot for the effect of acupuncture on the improvement of dependency measured by the Barthel Index. Although we undertook extensive literature searches, we still could not exclude the possibility that studies with negative findings remain unpublished.</P>
