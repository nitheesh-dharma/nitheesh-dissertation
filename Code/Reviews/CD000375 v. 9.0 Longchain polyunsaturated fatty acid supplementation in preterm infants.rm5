<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Whether feeding premature babies with formula milk supplemented with longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) results in improved vision and overall neurodevelopment.<B>
<BR/>Background: </B>LCPUFA are a type of fatty acid necessary for the maturation of the brain and retina. Unlike breast milk that contains high levels of LCPUFA, most infant formulae are known to only contain minimal amounts of LCPUFA. Babies fed with breast milk are known to have more mature visual skills and a higher IQ (intelligence quotient) than babies fed with formula milk. It has been suggested that the relatively high levels of LCPUFA found in breast milk may contribute to the higher IQ levels and visual skills. Some milk formulae are available with added LCPUFA, usually as fish oil.<B>
<BR/>Study characteristics: </B>Studies that compared the outcomes of premature babies (born at &lt; 37 weeks of pregnancy) who were given formula milk enriched with LCPUFA versus formula milk without enrichment with LCPUFA were analysed in this review.<B>
<BR/>Key results: </B>The researchers found that premature babies fed formula milk supplemented with LCPUFA do not have better outcomes compared to those fed formula milk without LCPUFA. <B>
<BR/>Quality of evidence: </B>The overall quality of evidence was considered low.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-04 02:22:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Sven M Schulzke">
<P>All authors assessed eligibility and trial quality, two authors extracted data separately. Study authors were contacted for additional information. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 19:46:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen trials involving 2260 preterm infants were included in the review. The risk of bias varied across the included trials with 10 studies having low risk of bias in a majority of the domains. The median gestational age (GA) in the included trials was 30 weeks and median birth weight (BW) was 1300 g. The median concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was 0.33% (range: 0.15% to 1%) and arachidonic acid (AA) 0.37% (range: 0.02% to 0.84%).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Visual acuity</B>
<BR/>Visual acuity over the first year was measured by Teller or Lea acuity cards in eight studies, by visual evoked potential (VEP) in six studies and by electroretinogram (ERG) in two studies. Most studies found no significant differences in visual acuity between supplemented and control infants. The form of data presentation and the varying assessment methods precluded the use of meta-analysis. A GRADE analysis for this outcome indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>
<P>
<B>Neurodevelopment<BR/>
</B>Three out of seven studies reported some benefit of LCPUFA on neurodevelopment at different postnatal ages. Meta-analysis of four studies evaluating Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 12 months (N = 364) showed no significant effect of supplementation (Mental Development Index (MDI): MD 0.96, 95% CI &#8722;1.42 to 3.34; P = 0.43; I² = 71% &#8212; Psychomotor DeveIopment Index (PDI): MD 0.23, 95% CI &#8722;2.77 to 3.22; P = 0.88; I² = 81%). Furthermore, three studies at 18 months (N = 494) also revealed no significant effect of LCPUFA on neurodevelopment (MDI: MD 2.40, 95% CI &#8722;0.33 to 5.12; P = 0.08; I² = 0% &#8212; PDI: MD 0.74, 95% CI &#8722;1.90 to 3.37; P = 0.58; I² = 54%). A GRADE analysis for these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>
<P>
<B>Physical growth</B>
<BR/>Four out of 15 studies reported benefits of LCPUFA on growth of supplemented infants at different postmenstrual ages (PMAs), whereas two trials suggested that LCPUFA-supplemented infants grow less well. One trial reported mild reductions in length and weight z scores at 18 months. Meta-analysis of five studies (N = 297) showed increased weight and length at two months post-term in supplemented infants (Weight: MD 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.33; P = 0.0010; I² = 69% &#8212; Length: MD 0.47, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.94; P = 0.05; I² = 0%). Meta-analysis of four studies at a corrected age of 12 months (N = 271) showed no significant effect of supplementation on growth outcomes (Weight: MD &#8722;0.10, 95% CI &#8722;0.31 to 0.12; P = 0.34; I² = 65% &#8212; Length: MD 0.25; 95% CI &#8722;0.33 to 0.84; P = 0.40; I² = 71% &#8212; Head circumference: MD &#8722;0.15, 95% CI &#8722;0.53 to 0.23; P = 0.45; I² = 0%). No significant effect of LCPUFA on weight, length or head circumference was observed on meta-analysis of two studies (n = 396 infants) at 18 months (Weight: MD &#8722;0.14, 95% CI &#8722;0.39 to 0.10; P = 0.26; I² = 66% &#8212; Length: MD &#8722;0.28, 95% CI &#8722;0.91 to 0.35; P = 0.38; I² = 90% &#8212; Head circumference: MD &#8722;0.18, 95% CI &#8722;0.53 to 0.18; P = 0.32; I² = 0%). A GRADE analysis for this outcome indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>

<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-08 17:09:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dietary fat in infancy is fundamental for the provision of energy, fat soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids (EFA). However, the type of fat required is controversial and interest has recently focused on the importance of longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). These fatty acids are found in high proportions in the structural lipids of cell membranes, particularly those of the central nervous system, and their accretion primarily occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Clandinin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clandinin 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>During pregnancy, DHA and AA cross the placenta to the fetus. Postnatally these fatty acids are supplied in breast milk, which contains a full complement of all PUFA including precursors and metabolites. However, most infant formulae contain only the precursor EFA (alpha linoleic acid (ALA; omega 3 precursor) and linoleic acid (LA; omega 6 precursor)) from which formula-fed infants must synthesise their own DHA and AA respectively. The absence of LCPUFA in formula may be further exacerbated by inhibition of incorporation of endogenously produced LCPUFA by the high concentrations of LA currently in most formulae.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-28 07:49:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Biochemical studies in both term and preterm infants indicate that formula-fed infants have significantly less DHA and AA in their erythrocytes relative to those fed breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1992</LINK>). This suggests that infant formula containing only LA and ALA may not be effective in meeting the full EFA requirements of infants.</P>
<P>Biochemical studies of LCPUFA are clinically relevant as dietary fatty acid supply may affect physiological function. In observational studies, term infants fed breast milk have been found to have more mature visual acuities and higher DHA levels than those receiving formula. Further, their visual acuities were positively correlated with erythrocyte DHA levels (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-28 07:53:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence to suggest that breast-fed infants have a long-term IQ advantage over those who have been fed formula has been evident in the literature for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow_x002d_Tlucak-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow-Tlucak 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2008</LINK>). As most of these studies are not randomised, the majority of comparisons between breast-fed and formula-fed infants are confounded by genetic and socioeconomic factors. These studies do not relate their findings to fatty acid supply. However, some reports suggest that the low levels of LCPUFA, such as DHA, found in formula-fed infants may contribute to the lower IQ scores reported in formula-fed infants (<LINK REF="REF-Neuringer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuringer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjerve-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjerve 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual development &#8211; assessment methods</HEADING>
<P>Visual acuity is a measure of the smallest element that can be resolved and may be assessed in infants by using gratings which consist of black and white stripes or checkerboard patterns. Grating acuity can be measured by using behavioural (Teller acuity cards) or visual evoked potential (VEP) methods. Each pairing of a black and white stripe is referred to as a cycle and the spatial frequency of a grating is defined by the number of cycles per degree of viewing angle. As grating spatial frequency increases, the stripes become finer and are more difficult to discriminate, eventually appearing as an even grey to the observer. Grating acuity is the highest spatial frequency where the stripes can be resolved.</P>
<P>The VEP is the electrical activity of the brain that is generated in response to a reversing contrast checkerboard or grating. The VEP is recorded from an electrode placed over the occipital pole. The amplitude of the VEP increases linearly with spatial frequency near the visual acuity threshold. Linear regression is used to fit a straight line through the linear portion of the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency curve and visual acuity is determined from the intercept of the regression line with the spatial frequency axis. Studies in this review have used different methods for assessing VEP (transient, steady state and sweep VEP). Transient VEP reflects a slow pattern reversal rate and records individual responses where the brain has time to recover after each reversal. A steady state VEP reflects a quick pattern reversal rate in which the next evoked response is actually evoked before the previous one has finished. The evoked responses hence run into each other so the output looks almost like a sine wave. The faster the reversal rate the more condensed the wave. The sweep/swept VEP is also a steady state technique but uses a different stimulus &#8212; usually stripes (instead of checks) that sweep through from the largest to the smallest in about 10 seconds.</P>
<P>Behavioural methods for assessing visual acuity rely on the strong preference shown by infants for patterned stimuli over non-patterned stimuli. Both the acuity card procedure (ACP) and the forced preferential looking (FPL) procedure have been used in conjunction with Teller acuity cards for measuring the development of visual acuity in infants. The FPL procedure tests binocular grating acuity: the tester views the infant behind a blind through a peephole, without knowledge of the spatial-frequency gratings on the cards, and makes a forced-choice judgement about which card the infant prefers. Individual acuities are converted to log cycles/degree and SD are in octaves which are determined by dividing one log SD by 0.3. The Lea acuity cards test uses a similar methodology but does not require blinds between examiner and child. The 'Hiding Heidi' low contrast test is a contrast sensitivity test using pictures with facial features (i.e. 'Hiding Heidi') presented at varying levels of contrast. The child's physical response to a particular card suggests the child sees 'Hiding Heidi' at that level of contrast.</P>
<P>Electroretinography, and its resultant ERG, is a method of assessment of retinal function. The more mature the retinal function, the lower the threshold required to elicit a response, and the higher the maximum amplitude recorded (threshold and Vmax are reported in log units).</P>
<P>For this review, most of the visual data is analyzed as mean ± SD in log values. This form of data presentation and the varying assessment methods preclude the use of meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual development &#8210; results</HEADING>
<P>Visual acuity using Teller cards was measured in the <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK> studies. In the 1992 study, the supplement was fed until 12 months and visual acuity was better in the supplemented group at two and four months post-term but not at six, nine, and twelve months (the data are published in Figures only and therefore cannot be included in the Tables for this review). In the 1996 study, LCPUFA supplementation was fed until two months post-term and visual acuity assessed over 12 months post-term. At two months, the supplemented infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had better visual acuity compared with control but supplemented infants with BPD had poorer visual acuity compared with control. No differences between supplemented and control groups (with or without BPD) were detected at four, six, nine and twelve months.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Diersen_x002d_Schade-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diersen-Schade 1998</LINK> study, visual acuity was also assessed with Teller acuity cards and no difference was documented between supplemented and control infants at two and four months post-term. <LINK REF="STD-Fadella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fadella 1996</LINK> assessed vision using the flash VEP; waveforms of the supplemented group were of different morphology and some of shorter latency than those of the control group &#8212; the latencies of N4 and P4 were shorter in the supplemented group but the latencies of N2, P2, N3 and P3 were not significantly different between the groups. There are concerns with the methodology of assessment in this study in that it deviates from international standards (International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision). Therefore, the data reported are difficult to interpret and sensitivity may have been decreased so much that changes due to the intervention may not have been detected.</P>

Data were also published at six and nine months for the 1993 study but were not included in this review. The Fagan Infantest measures novelty preference based on the observation that after habituation to a familiar stimulus has occurred, a preference will be shown for a different (novel) stimulus if both the familiar and novel stimuli are presented together. A novelty preference score is derived for the average percent of total time spent viewing the novel stimuli on ten discrete paired comparison tests. Infants with average scores of greater than 57% are said to have a significant novelty preference, that is the time spent looking at the novel stimuli compared with that spent looking at the familiar stimuli is greater than by chance alone. Novelty preference has been interpreted as an early measure of information-processing capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Fagan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagan 1970</LINK>). Only a subset of the <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK> cohort was assessed by the same version of the Fagan test as the <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1992</LINK> cohort and so the meta-analysis was limited to the subset of the 1996 cohort. Contrary to their hypothesis, novelty preference was lower in the supplemented group. However, the number of looks was higher and the duration of each look was shorter in the supplemented group, which the investigators thought may indicate better cognition.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-08 17:12:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from 17 RCTs (2260 preterm infants) does not indicate a long-term benefit of LCPUFA supplementation of formula on visual development, neurodevelopment or physical growth of preterm infants.</P>
<P>Visual acuity was measured by Teller and Lea acuity cards in eight studies, by visual evoked potential (VEP) in six studies and by electroretinography in two studies. Most studies found no differences in visual outcomes between supplemented and control infants (exceptions were <LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2001</LINK>, where VEP acuity was more mature at two months post-term, and at 6 months post-term in a subgroup of supplemented infants respectively).</P>
<P>The Fagan Infantest measures novelty preference which, under controlled conditions, has moderate predictive validity for performance in standardised intelligence tests in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Fagan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagan 1983</LINK>). Normal infants should have a novelty preference with the mean novelty preference for term infants being 62%. <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK> demonstrated lower novelty preferences in the supplemented compared with the control group. Despite this, the investigators concluded that supplemented preterm infants may have more rapid visual information processing given that they took more looks and each look was of shorter duration. Most other studies assessed neurodevelopment by BSID with three out of seven studies reporting some benefit of LCPUFA in different populations of supplemented infants at different postnatal ages (<LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clandinin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clandinin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four out of fifteen studies reported benefits of LCPUFA on growth of supplemented infants at different postnatal ages (<LINK REF="STD-Diersen_x002d_Schade-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diersen-Schade 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Innis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clandinin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clandinin 2005</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK> suggest that preterm infants fed n-3 LCPUFA supplements grow less well than controls and they give some evidence that poor growth in their studies may be due to a reduction in AA levels which occurs when n-3 supplements alone are used. Recent studies add AA to the supplement and usually find no significant negative effect on growth. The only exception is <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2002</LINK> where mild reductions in length and weight z-scores were reported at 18 months. Contrary to these results, meta-analysis of five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Uauy-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Uauy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diersen_x002d_Schade-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Diersen-Schade 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Innis 2002</LINK>) showed increased weight and length at two months post-term in supplemented infants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently, there has been discussion as to whether LCPUFA supplementation has gender-specific effects. The latest findings from <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK> study participants at 10 years (Kennedy 2010 and Isaacs 2011) reported that girls who received LCPUFA-supplemented formula had greater weight, length, head circumference and blood pressure at 10 years. The girls who received LCPUFA-supplemented formula also had better scores on word reading scores and spelling scores. However, the results need to be interpreted with caution since the sample size was extremely small (maximum total N = 68 girls). It is also important to note that in contrast to the 10-year outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK> where girls had better cognitive scores, in the original <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK> study, boys who received LCPUFA supplementation experienced beneficial effects on cognition with higher Bayley MDI scores (LCPUFA 86.4 (13.9) vs controls 80.8 (13.0); p = 0.04)). The DINO trial (<LINK REF="STD-Makrides-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 2009</LINK>) that compared high-dose versus low-dose DHA in preterm infants showed higher MDI scores at 18 months of age in girls supplemented with high-dose DHA compared to girls who received low-dose DHA. However, at seven years of age, girls who received high-dose DHA had poorer executive function and behaviour compared to girls who received low-dose DHA (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2015</LINK>). Hence, when the results of <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Makrides-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 2009</LINK> are considered together, it appears that there are no consistent gender-specific differences in the outcomes for LCPUFA supplementation.</P>
<P>Overall, this meta-analysis found no clear long-term benefits on visual or intellectual development. The justification for adding LCPUFA to formula is based on the rationale of mimicking the composition of human milk and not on evidence of important clinical benefits. A supplement containing a balance of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA is unlikely to impair the growth of preterm infants.</P>
<P>Overall, methodology varied considerably between studies making a summary of the combined data difficult. Some of the disparity between findings may be due to different combinations of LCPUFA in the supplement and different concentrations of EFA in the control formula. Higher ALA and lower LA:ALA will favour DHA synthesis. Another variable is the medical complications and treatments associated with preterm birth with most studies only enrolling relatively healthy formula-fed infants.</P>
<P>In the recent years, a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the effect of LCPUFA in preterm neonates, the details of which are given below. The results have been inconsistent.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Qawasmi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qawasmi 2012</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (12 term and 7 preterm RCTs) and concluded that LCPUFA supplementation improves visual acuity up to 12 months of age. However, the benefits were not statistically significant for the subgroup of preterm infant RCTs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Beyerlein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beyerlein 2010</LINK> conducted an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of 870 infants from four large RCTs (two preterm RCTs and two term RCTS) of LCPUFA supplementation in formula. For preterm infants, they reported no significant differences in BSID scores at 18 months of age between the LCPUFA and control groups (N = 341, mean difference for MDI scores 1.9, 95% CI &#8722;1.3 to 5.0; mean difference for PDI scores &#8722;0.2, 95% CI &#8722;3.2 to 2.7).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Jiao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiao 2014</LINK> evaluated the role of DHA on cognitive function in infants, children and adults by conducting an extensive systematic review. They found that DHA supplements improved PDI and MDI scores in infants, but the included studies were term infants, not preterm.</P>
<P>Possible reasons for the inconsistent results from RCTs were discussed by <LINK REF="REF-Meldrum-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldrum 2011</LINK>. They hypothesized that variable sample size, genetic and gender differences, dose and duration of supplementation, compliance and test selections may be the reasons behind the inconclusive findings in these RCTs.</P>
<P>Currently, the research focus seems to have shifted paradigm to identify the optimal dose of DHA rather than comparing LCPUFA formulae to non-supplemented formulae. This is based on the finding that the DHA requirement in the neonatal period substantially exceeds that delivered by typical feeding (breastmilk or formula milk) in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2015</LINK>). However, the RCTs of high-dose DHA supplements given to breast milk-fed preterm infants have also reported inconsistent effects of supplementation on neurodevelopmental and visual outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smithers-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Smithers 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrides-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smithers-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smithers 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almaas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Almaas 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alshweki-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alshweki 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<BR/>We evaluated the following and entered the findings into the risk of bias tables:</P>
<P>1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- Low (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>- High (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>- Unclear.</P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- Low (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>- High (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>- Unclear.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias and detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- Low, High or Unclear for participants;</P>
<P>- Low, High or Unclear for personnel;</P>
<P>- Low, High or Unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- Low (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>- High (&#8805; 20% missing data):</P>
<P>- Unclear.</P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- Low (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>- High (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- Unclear.</P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- Low; High; or unclear.</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
