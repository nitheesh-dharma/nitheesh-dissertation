We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in.</P><P>The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias.</P><P>Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-11 13:43:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:29:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease.

We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:04:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.</P><P>Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence).</P><P>There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence).

An estimated 17.7 million people die of cardiovascular disease each year (2015 figures) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016</LINK>). Primary and secondary prophylaxis aims to modify major risk factors. Antiplatelet therapy improves the survival of people with manifest cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 2011</LINK>).</P><P>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as antiplatelet therapy is the drug of choice due to its good cost-effectiveness profile (<LINK REF="REF-Gaspoz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaspoz 2002</LINK>). Based on one meta-analysis, the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATC) concluded that aspirin is protective in most people at risk of cardiovascular events. In this analysis, people at risk were those with acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease or atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2009</LINK>)</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-28 17:54:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Several molecules that inhibit platelet aggregation are currently available in clinical practice, in particular the old (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and the new (prasugrel, ticagrelor) P2Y12 inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-ACCP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCP 2012</LINK>). Previously published reviews and protocols in the Cochrane Library discussed the importance of antiplatelet drugs and their limits in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, mainly in peripheral artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bedenis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedenis 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bedenis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedenis 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cosmi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosmi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorffler_x002d_Melly-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorffler-Melly 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorffler_x002d_Melly-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorffler-Melly 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorffler-Melly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geraghty-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geraghty 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hankey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robless-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robless-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valentine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentine 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2011</LINK>). Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2009</LINK>) by inhibiting platelets by two different mechanisms. Aspirin has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, whereas other antiplatelet drugs are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor/P2Y12 inhibitors. Worldwide, clopidogrel is the most frequently used P2Y12 inhibitor for cardiovascular disease prevention. Clopidogrel has been clinically compared with aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>), and combined with aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-CREDO-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CREDO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CURE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 2001</LINK>), and demonstrated a good safety profile in these studies.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-27 14:03:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>The combination treatment of clopidogrel plus aspirin could be a potential strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease because, although the relative risk reduction of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in people receiving aspirin was approximately 20% (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2009</LINK>), the protection with a single antiplatelet therapy in people with a high risk of cardiovascular disease remains unsatisfactory in absolute terms. Moreover, low compliance and adverse effects limit the cost effectiveness of aspirin alone (<LINK REF="REF-Morant-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morant 2003</LINK>). As confirmed by one systematic review and economic evaluation conducted on behalf of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), it was suggested that people with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome benefit from aspirin in combination with clopidogrel compared to treatment with aspirin alone (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Given that the antiplatelet effect is consistent in different populations, any age, sex and risk subgroups could derive benefit from the combination therapy.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-27 14:06:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Clopidogrel has a good safety profile but it has several adverse effects that should be balanced with the potential beneficial effects. Besides bleeding associated with combined antiplatelet use, additional adverse effects for clopidogrel include diarrhoea, abdominal pain and dyspepsia, which are common. Moreover, some rare, but potentially severe complications need to be considered. Indeed, thienopyridines can provoke potentially severe neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Hankey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankey 2004</LINK>), although the risk is lower with clopidogrel compared to ticlopidine (<LINK REF="REF-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>). Finally, clopidogrel-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), albeit rare, is associated with high mortality if not treated promptly (<LINK REF="REF-Zakarija-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakarija 2004</LINK>).</P><P>The aim of this systematic review, an update of a previously published Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Squizzato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squizzato 2011</LINK>), was to assess the effects of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:01:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but do not have a coronary stent.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2017-12-11 13:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:29:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-11-27 14:07:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone.

We extracted data for five primary outcomes (cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, and adverse events) and three secondary outcomes (major bleeding, minor bleeding and heart failure). Data for the five primary outcomes and two secondary outcomes (major bleeding and minor bleeding) are shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P><P>We found a beneficial effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin in reducing risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, but this was also associated with an increased risk of major and minor bleeding. For other outcomes, there was no evidence for a difference between the effect of clopidogrel with aspirin compared with aspirin alone or aspirin with placebo.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:06:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For a correct interpretation of these data, some comments are necessary. Several single secondary outcomes were not available in the published papers, and could not be obtained from the trial investigators. This means that the overall treatment effect may be estimated with bias as published results from particular outcomes may be correlated with the size of the effect.</P><P>The CURE study enrolled people with a recent non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and showed strong evidence of benefit for the primary outcome of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction. By contrast, the data from the <LINK REF="STD-CHARISMA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CHARISMA 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PROCLAIM-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PROCLAIM 2009</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Vavuranakis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vavuranakis 2006</LINK> studies showed a benefit of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone, suggesting insufficient evidence to support the use of treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin in non-acute people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Data from the <LINK REF="STD-CURE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 2001</LINK> study suggested that the main benefit of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy was in the initial period. Therefore, it is probable that clopidogrel plus aspirin was associated with an even smaller reduction in the risk of having a cardiovascular event during long-term follow-up to a mean of nine months. Given that we excluded trials with less than 30 days of treatment, a definitive conclusion on the early effects of treatment and the optimal duration of treatment were not possible. In a CURE subgroup analysis, the authors reported data between 30 days and one year after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-CURE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 2001</LINK>). The exclusion of people who had an event in the first 30 days may have undermined the balance achieved by randomisation in the groups. For this reason, these data are potentially biased and any interpretation is difficult.</P><P>We also retrieved sufficient data to perform four predefined subgroup analyses: acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation, coronary artery bypass grafting, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease undergoing revascularization procedures. Available data on three subgroup populations (i.e. coronary artery bypass grafting, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease undergoing revascularization procedure) suggested that bleeding events were increased in each subgroup. In particular, the subanalysis on participants with ischaemic stroke suggested that clopidogrel plus aspirin increased major bleeding and minor bleeding. The only study that included post-stroke patients (<LINK REF="STD-SPS3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SPS3 2012</LINK>) reported higher all-cause mortality among people taking clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. This would indicate that this treatment option should be very carefully assessed in people who have had a stroke. </P><P>In addition, SVG patency was more common in the group of participants undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting taking clopidogrel plus aspirin.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:03:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Offsetting the beneficial antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel is the clear increased risk of major and minor bleeding that was demonstrated during use of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). In addition, it should be considered that people at high risk of bleeding were excluded in all trials. For example, in the CURE study, people with contraindications to antithrombotic/antiplatelet therapy, at high risk of bleeding or ongoing long-term need for oral anticoagulants were excluded (<LINK REF="REF-CURE-protocol" TYPE="REFERENCE">CURE protocol</LINK>).</P><P>Based on the available data, four of the 15 included studies was assessed at overall low risk of bias for domains other than industry funding (<LINK REF="STD-CASCADE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CASCADE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CASPAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CASPAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CURE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FASTER-2007" TYPE="STUDY">FASTER 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P><P>According to the GRADE system, quality of evidence was generally moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality) and adverse events (very low quality evidence) (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of bias</HEADING><P>Only one outcome (fatal and non-fatal stroke) was downgraded due to concerns about a serious risk of bias.

For people undergoing a revascularization procedure for peripheral arterial disease, we analysed data on the risk of amputation. The results of these unplanned analyses of additional outcomes for particular groups should be viewed with caution as they may be affected by publication bias towards positive findings, and because the decision to include them was made after seeing the results.</P><P>Several included studies were funded by the pharmaceutical companies who developed and sold clopidogrel.

According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was very low to moderate. In particular, use of combination therapy is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, major bleeding and minor bleeding in people with a previous ischaemic stroke. In people with acute non-ST coronary syndromes, combination treatment from one to 12 months after acute event could be of benefit in people at low-risk of bleeding.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:01:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>From a public health perspective, given the high prevalence of atherothrombosis, even a small benefit may be desirable. At this time, additional data are needed to identify a subgroup of people at very high risk of cardiovascular events and at very low risk of bleeding in which the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin may be of clinical benefit. Before starting a new randomised controlled trial (RCT), it is advisable that reliable clinical or laboratory (or both) prognostic markers be available to select people for inclusion. Finally, forthcoming trials should uniformly present outcomes to avoid many of the problems we have experienced in being unable to get the relevant data and to permit easier systematic reviewing of the RCTs.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-12-11 11:01:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors thank Dr SR Steinhubl, Dr RF Storey and Dr VA Mannacio for providing additional information of the <LINK REF="STD-CREDO-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CREDO 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ONSET_x002f_OFFSET-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ONSET/OFFSET 2010</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-CRYSSA-2012" TYPE="STUDY">CRYSSA 2012</LINK> study, respectively.

People were eligible for the trial if they were aged 45 years or older and had one of the following conditions: multiple atherothrombotic risk factors, documented coronary disease, documented cerebrovascular disease or documented symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. After a median of 28 months of follow-up, a predefined primary efficacy endpoint was composed including: first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke (of any cause) or death from cardiovascular causes (including haemorrhage). The principal secondary efficacy endpoint was a composite of first occurrence of the primary endpoint, or hospitalisation for unstable angina, a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a revascularization procedure (coronary, cerebral, peripheral). The primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding, according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage, or bleeding that caused haemodynamic compromise requiring blood or fluid replacement, inotropic support or surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-GUSTO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">GUSTO 1993</LINK>).</P><P>A pilot study to examine the effects of clopidogrel compared to placebo on markers of inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome who were receiving background therapy, including low-dose aspirin (PROCLAIM) was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-PROCLAIM-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PROCLAIM 2009</LINK>). A total of 181 people who had metabolic syndrome, an atherothrombotic vascular event or cardiovascular intervention six or more months earlier, and an high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level between 2 mg/L and 10 mg/L at screening, were randomised to receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus aspirin 81 mg/day (participants = 89; mean age ( standard deviation (SD)) 55.9  12 years; range 18.3 to 82.4 years; male sex 43.8%) or placebo plus aspirin 81 mg daily (participants = 92; mean age ( SD) 56.3  12 years; range 24.4 to 32.3 years; male sex 41.3%) for nine weeks to assess the efficacy of each treatment in suppression of inflammatory markers. Change from baseline in the levels of hsCRP, CD40 ligand, P-selectin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide at six weeks was assessed to evaluate each treatment.</P><P>The Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) study randomised 12,562 people with a non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome to receive either clopidogrel loading dose 300 mg orally, followed by 75 mg daily or placebo plus aspirin recommended dose 75 mg to 325 mg (<LINK REF="STD-CURE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 2001</LINK>). After a mean follow-up of nine months, a predefined primary endpoint was composed including: death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal acute MI or stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic). A secondary combined endpoint was a composite of the primary endpoint and refractory ischaemia. The safety endpoint of bleeding was defined as life-threatening, severe (requiring two or more units of blood transfusions) or minor.</P><P>Vavuranakis and colleagues performed a randomised, single-blind, controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vavuranakis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vavuranakis 2006</LINK>). They randomised inpatients aged greater than 21 years with acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation to one of two groups: aspirin 325 mg/day for one week, followed by aspirin 100 mg/day plus clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg daily for 36 weeks or aspirin alone 325 mg daily for one week, followed by 75 mg daily for 36 weeks. Levels of serum sCD40L, hsCRP and P-selectin were determined on admission and at eight hours, 48 hours and six days of treatment. By means of clinical follow-up, Kaplan-Meier free-of-major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) plots were used to assess the prevalence of MACEs, including cardiovascular-related death, in people with and without high levels of hsCRP (greater than 3 mg/L) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) (greater than 5 &#956;g/L) for 52 weeks. The study enrolled 86 participants (mean age ( SD) 68  3 years; 71 men, 15 women).</P><P>In the Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient ischaemic attack to prevent Early Recurrence (FASTER) study, investigators randomly assigned, in a factorial design, 392 people with TIA or minor stroke to clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose then 75 mg daily (198 participants) or placebo (194 participants), and simvastatin 40 mg/day (199 participants) or placebo (193 participants) within 24 hours of symptom onset (<LINK REF="STD-FASTER-2007" TYPE="STUDY">FASTER 2007</LINK>). Baseline characteristics of participants were: clopidogrel only: participants = 98, mean age ( SD) 68.9  13.0 years, female sex 46.9%; simvastatin and clopidogrel: participants = 100, mean age ( SD) 67.1  12.9 years, female sex 39%; double placebo: participants = 95, mean age ( SD) 69.8  12.3 years, female sex 55.8%; simvastatin only: participants = 99, mean age ( SD) 66.6  14.2 years, female sex 47.5%. All participants were given aspirin and were followed for 90 days. The trial was stopped early due to failure to recruit participants at the prespecified minimum enrolment rate. Descriptive analyses were done by intention to treat. The primary outcome was total stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) within 90 days. Safety outcomes included haemorrhage related to clopidogrel and myositis related to simvastatin.</P><P>The Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) trial tested two randomised interventions in a 2  2 factorial design in people with recent symptomatic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed lacunar stroke: clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone and two target levels of systolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-SPS3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SPS3 2012</LINK>). The antiplatelet component of the trial was terminated at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee because of lack of efficacy combined with evidence of harm. It was a double-blind, multi-centre trial involving 3020 participants with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by MRI. Participants were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel 75 mg (participants = 1517; mean age 63 years; male sex 62%) or placebo daily (participants = 1503; mean age 63 years; male sex 64%); participants in both groups received aspirin 325 mg daily, and to one of the two groups defined by target levels for systolic blood pressure (less than 130 mmHg versus 130 mmHg to 149 mmHg) (with participants and practitioners aware of the group assignments). The primary outcome was any recurrent stroke, including ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage.</P><P>The Clopidogrel After Surgery for Coronary Artery DiseasE (CASCADE) study was undertaken to evaluate whether the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin inhibits saphenous vein graft (SVG) disease after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as assessed at one year by intravascular ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-CASCADE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CASCADE 2010</LINK>). In this double-blind phase II trial, 113 participants undergoing CABG with SVGs were randomised to receive aspirin 162 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily (participants = 56; mean age ( SD) 64.9  7.5 years; male sex 91.1%) or aspirin 162 mg plus placebo daily (participants =57; mean age ( SD) 68.1  7.4 years; male sex 87.7%) for one year. The primary outcome was SVG intimal hyperplasia (mean intimal area) as determined by intravascular ultrasound at one year. Secondary outcomes were graft patency, MACE events and major bleeding.</P><P>The Prevention of Coronary arteRY bypaSS occlusion After off-pump procedures (CRYSSA) study was a single-centre prospective randomised controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-CRYSSA-2012" TYPE="STUDY">CRYSSA 2012</LINK>). The study randomised 300 participants who underwent off-pump CABG to receive aspirin (participants = 150; mean age ( SD) 58.9  8.3 years; male sex 75.3%) or aspirin plus clopidogrel (participants = 150; mean age ( SD) 59.4  7.7 years; male sex 73.3%). Aspirin 100 mg or aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily was initiated when postoperative chest tube drainage was less than 51 mL/hr for two hours and participants were followed up for 12 months. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of platelet function, angiographic evaluation of coronary revascularization by 64-slice computed tomography and clinical outcome.</P><P>Gao and colleagues performed a single-centre, randomised, controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2010</LINK>). They randomly assigned 249 consecutive participants undergoing elective CABG to two groups: 124 participants received aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily (mean age ( SD) 57.9  8.25 years, female sex 17.7%), and 125 participants received aspirin 100 mg alone daily (mean age ( SD) 59.8  7.92 years, female sex 16.2%). Antiplatelet therapies were initiated when postoperative chest tube drainage was less than 31 mL/hours for two hours. All participants were invited for clinical follow-up and 64-slice multislice computed tomography angiography analysis at three months postoperatively. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to determine predictors of graft patency.</P><P>The Clopidogrel and Acetylsalicylic acid in bypass Surgery for Peripheral Arterial disease (CASPAR) study randomised 851 participants receiving a unilateral below knee bypass graft (venous or prosthetic) for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="STD-CASPAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CASPAR 2010</LINK>). Participants were enrolled two to four days after surgery and were randomly assigned to clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin 75 to 100 mg/day (participants = 425; mean age ( SD) 66.5  8.7 years, male sex 75.5%) or placebo plus aspirin 75 mg/day to 100 mg/day (participants = 426; mean age ( SD) 65.6  8.5 years, male sex 75.8%) for six to 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of index-graft occlusion or revascularization, above-ankle amputation of the affected limb or death. The primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding (GUSTO classification) (<LINK REF="REF-GUSTO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">GUSTO 1993</LINK>).</P><P>The MIRROR study randomised 80 people undergoing percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) alone or PTA with additional stenting of the femoropopliteal lesion if required (<LINK REF="STD-MIRROR-2012" TYPE="STUDY">MIRROR 2012</LINK>). Stents were used if clinically indicated after primary PTA either because of stenosis of greater than 30% after primary PTA or because of flow-limiting dissection after primary PTA. Participants received either aspirin 500 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg before intervention followed by a daily dose of aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg for six months (participants = 40; mean age ( SD) 69.8  8.8 years, male 19, female 21), or the same doses of aspirin plus placebo instead of clopidogrel (participants = 40; mean age ( SD) 70.2  11.4 years, male 23, female 17). Primary endpoints were concentration of platelet activation markers &#946;-thromboglobulin and CD40L and the rate of participants resistant to clopidogrel. Secondary endpoint was the assessment of clinical status at six months after the intervention. Data after discontinuation of clopidogrel/placebo were not included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-MIRROR-2012" TYPE="STUDY">MIRROR 2012</LINK>).</P><P>The Aspirin and Plavix Following Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting study randomised 20 people undergoing CABG to compare clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus aspirin 81 mg versus aspirin 81 mg and placebo. The primary outcome was postoperative graft patency at two and 52 weeks determined by less than 50% bypass graft stenosis by cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The secondary outcomes were MACE, defined as MI, thrombotic events and angina, and safety endpoints defined as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major and minor bleeding events (<LINK REF="STD-ASAP_x002d_CABG-2016" TYPE="STUDY">ASAP-CABG 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Gasparovic and colleagues performed a single-centre, randomised, controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gasparovic-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparovic 2014</LINK>). They randomly assigned 219 aspirin-resistant people according to multiple electrode aggregometry to receive clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 300 mg (participants = 112; mean age ( SD) 65  8 years; male sex 83%) or aspirin monotherapy 300 mg (participants = 110; mean age ( SD) 65  9 years; male sex 82%). Adults scheduled to elective primary CABG on postoperative day four underwent an aggregometry-based assessment of their on-aspirin platelet reactivity. Participants found to be aspirin-resistant were randomised into either control or intervention groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at six months. MACCE was a composite outcome including all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, cerebrovascular accident and cardiovascular rehospitalization. The secondary outcomes were bleeding events and individual MACCE components. They adhered to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium definitions in presenting the safety endpoint data (<LINK REF="REF-BARC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BARC 2011</LINK>).</P><P>The <LINK REF="STD-TEG_x002d_CABG" TYPE="STUDY">TEG-CABG</LINK> study was a prospective randomised controlled trial with an open-label design. Participants undergoing CABG procedure were preoperatively identified with a hypercoagulable state by thrombelastography (TEG) (<LINK REF="STD-TEG_x002d_CABG" TYPE="STUDY">TEG-CABG</LINK>). People were eligible if they were undergoing an isolated elective or urgent CABG procedure, TEG maximum amplitude was 69 mm or greater, aged 18 years or above and able to give informed consent. Eligible people were randomised to receive aspirin 75 mg (started within six to 24 hours after surgery) plus clopidogrel with a bolus dose of 300 mg (day two postoperatively) follow by 75 mg (participants = 79, mean age ( SD) 65.2  10.3 years, female sex 26) versus aspirin 75 mg alone (participants = 81, mean age ( SD) 66.6  8.5 years, female sex 25) for three months. The primary study outcome was graft patency assessed at three months by MSCT. Secondary outcomes were thromboembolic events and death, postprocedural day four coagulability itself as an independent factor of graft occlusion, thromboembolic events or death, platelet inhibition and its relation to graft patency, thromboembolic events and death. All outcomes were evaluated three months after surgery.</P><P>Zuo and colleagues performed a prospective, randomised, single-centre study of efficacy of clopidogrel plus aspirin as compared with aspirin alone in people with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, including acute cerebral infarction or TIA, combined with intracranial and extracranial arteriostenosis (<LINK REF="STD-Zuo-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Zuo 2017</LINK>). The study included 200 eligible participants. Median age was 62 years and 79 (39.5%) participants were female. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive aspirin 100 mg alone (participants = 68, median age 62.29 years, range 45 to 80 years, 27 female), or clopidogrel 50 mg plus aspirin 100 mg (participants = 66, median age 61.58 years, range 45 to 80 years, 28 female), or clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 100 mg (participants = 66, median age 61.55 years, range 45 to 80 years, 24 female), on day one to day 90. The main study endpoints were recurrence of ischaemic stroke, death from any causes and death from cardiovascular causes (including haemorrhage) in the first 90 days after cerebral infarction or TIA. Several haemorrhagic events were monitored based on the GUSTO definition. Nasal and gum bleeding were also examined. For our review, we considered only the two groups of participants receiving aspirin 100 mg alone and aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg because no other study in this review used aspirin plus low-dose clopidogrel (50 mg) as the intervention group.</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;14 studies included in meta-analsis for at least one outcome&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;15 studies (reported in 30 references) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;2 studies included in previous version of review&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;13 NEW studies included&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;82 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;6421 records screened&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;6421 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8772 records identified through database searching (2009-2017)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;3 additional records identified through other sources&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;6339 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;51 full-text articles excluded for not fulfilling the inclusion criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 10 did not report clinical data;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 5 included only people with coronary stents;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 15 had a short (&amp;lt; 30 days) duration;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 2 included only people with transcatheter aortic valve implantation;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 2 were abstract with only partial data on included participants;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 4 had no a proper study design;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 13 were subanalyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 ongoing study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
