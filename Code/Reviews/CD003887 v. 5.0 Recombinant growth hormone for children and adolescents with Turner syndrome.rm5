<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting the sexual development and appearance of girls and women. Women with TS are much shorter than other women (by about 21 cm or eight inches). To try to overcome slow growth, recombinant growth hormone (hGH) has been given. The hormone is injected under the skin several times a week until final adult height is achieved. The review found some evidence that hGH does increase short-term growth in girls with TS and adult height (an increase of perhaps five centimeters or two inches). However, girls treated with hGH are still substantially shorter than other women as adults. Final height in 61 treated women was 148 cm and 141 cm in 43 untreated women. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Turner syndrome (TS) affects about one in 1500 to 2500 live-born females. One of the most prevalent and salient features of the syndrome is extremely short stature. Untreated women are approximately 20 to 21 cm shorter than normal women within their respective populations. Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) has been used to increase growth and final height in girls who have Turner syndrome.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of recombinant growth hormone in children and adolescents with TS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, LILACS, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and reference lists were used to identify relevant trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with TS before achieving final height. Growth hormone had to be administered for a minimum of six months and compared with a placebo or no treatment control condition.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. The primary outcomes were final height and growth. Secondary outcomes included bone age, quality of life, cognitive performance, and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four RCTs that included 365 participants after one year of treatment were included. Only one trial reported final height in 61 treated women to be 148 cm and 141 cm in 43 untreated women (mean difference (MD) seven cm, 95% CI 6 to 8). Short-term growth velocity was greater in treated than untreated girls after one year (two trials, MD three cm per year, 95% CI 2 to 4) and after two years (one trial, MD two cm per year, 95% CI 1 to 2.3). Skeletal maturity was not accelerated by treatment with recombinant growth hormone (hGH). Adverse effects were minimally reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) doses between 0.3 to 0.375 mg/kg/wk increase short-term growth in girls with Turner syndrome by approximately three (two) cm in the first (second) year of treatment. Treatment in one trial increased final height by approximately six cm over an untreated control group. Despite this increase, the final height of treated women was still outside the normal range. Additional trials of the effects of hGH carried out with control groups until final height is achieved would allow better informed decisions about whether the benefits of hGH treatment outweigh the requirement of treatment over several years at considerable cost.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 22:12:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Turner syndrome (TS) is the most common sex-chromosome abnormality in females and affects approximately three percent of females conceived (<LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>). However, as there is a high spontaneous miscarriage rate, TS affects one in 1500 to 2500 live-born females (<LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>). Affected individuals either have a single X chromosome (45,X) or display chromosomal mosaicism (45,X/46,XX). Chromosomal mosaicism is a condition in which some cells have one chromosome constitution and others another. This results in an individual having two or more genotypically distinct cell lines. This condition results in individuals who are phenotypically female (in other words whose appearance is female), but who have a very high likelihood of ovarian failure. Girls and women with TS may present with any of a number of physical abnormalities (for example, growth failure, gonadal dysgenesis, abnormalities of some internal organs, "square" appearance) as well as some cognitive difficulties such as difficulties in non-verbal problem solving (for example, mathematics) or visual-spatial processing, although overall intelligence is generally normal (<LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Turner syndrome: effects on height</HEADING>
<P>Turner Syndrome (TS) is one of the most common organic causes of short stature in girls and between 80 and 100 percent of girls with TS will have growth failure (<LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>). Short stature is the most common finding in TS and is almost always present even in patients who do not display other clinical features. However, short stature may not be present if the girl has inherited her remaining X chromosome from a tall parent.<BR/>TS usually involves mild intrauterine growth restriction (about one standard deviation [SD] below normal), decreased growth rates during infancy and childhood (generally about two SD below the normal mean) and pronounced lack of pubertal growth resulting in height approximately four SD below the mean at about age 14 (<LINK REF="REF-Ranke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>). Thereafter, growth continues slowly back toward the norm with final height about 2.6 SD below the mean of normal adult women (<LINK REF="REF-Ranke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranke 1988</LINK>). The growth phase is more prolonged than in normal girls not generally being completed before the end of the second decade of life. Although the mechanism of growth failure in TS is not well understood, it "probably results from an impaired response to growth hormone combined with an underlying skeletal dysplasia" (<LINK REF="REF-Rochiccioli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochiccioli 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Most studies suggest that the adult height of untreated girls with TS generally averages approximately 143 cm to 144 cm (56 in to 57 in), however, individual studies of final height in TS have reported means ranging from 136 cm to 147 cm (<LINK REF="REF-Rochiccioli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochiccioli 1994</LINK>). This is approximately 20 to 21 cm (eight inches) shorter than normal women within their respective populations. Final height of untreated girls with TS is related to the average of the parents' heights. Although the mean final height of groups of girls with TS generally falls within a fairly narrow range, there is a great deal of variability among individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Rochiccioli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochiccioli 1994</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 22:12:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Growth hormone has been administered in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) as well as in children with other aetiologies for growth failure. Although TS does not involve a deficiency of growth hormone, it is believed that growth failure may be related to an impaired response to growth hormone and that administration of additional growth hormone may enhance growth in children and adolescents with TS (<LINK REF="REF-Gault-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gault 2001</LINK>).<BR/>Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) has been available since 1985, shortly after growth hormone from cadaveric human pituitaries was withdrawn from use because of its association with the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Recombinant human growth hormone (somatropin) is produced by recombinant DNA technology and has a sequence identical to that of human growth hormone. Somatropin is available from several manufacturers under several different brand names. The advent of recombinant hGH has meant that hGH is far more available and hGH has been widely used to treat various growth disorders including TS (<LINK REF="REF-Gault-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gault 2001</LINK>).<BR/>Recombinant human growth hormone is usually prescribed in association with a paediatric endocrinologist or a general paediatrician with a special interest in endocrinology. It is prescribed in milligrams (mg) or International Units (IU) (3 IU = 1 mg) according to body weight or body surface area and is self administered (or given by a parent) at home usually as a subcutaneous injection generally six to seven times per week. Whether dose is computed by weight or body surface area can have a significant effect on the dose given and is particularly relevant in older girls with TS who may have problems with weight gain. Among younger girls (age 5) a dose based on surface area was reported to be as much as 33% greater than one based on weight, whereas among older girls (age 15) the dose based on surface area could be as much as 10% less (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1999</LINK>). The dose of hGH generally recommended for use in TS is not often specified, but a dose of 0.375 mg/kg/week has been suggested by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 1998</LINK>). This dose is approximately double that used in children with growth hormone deficiency. To more closely approximate the natural daily fluctuations in hGH, the injections are usually given at night.<BR/>In growth hormone deficiency, hGH is given as replacement therapy (that is, a physiological dose), in which it is intended to supplement low levels of naturally occurring hGH up to normal levels. However, in TS, hGH is given at supra physiological levels - levels considerably higher than a replacement dose. The logic in administering supra physiological doses is generally that children with TS have a growth deficiency, but not a hormone deficiency, and therefore have some lack of sensitivity to the hormone.<BR/>Growth hormone is generally prescribed for a number of years - from the diagnosis of the growth deficit until growth is complete. For an individual child how long this would be will depend upon when TS is diagnosed and whether the child, parents, and physician deem treatment necessary. However, even in congenital disorders of growth such as TS, diagnosis may not occur until the child is several years old. Most trials of hGH have been of relatively short duration (for example, five years), but in practice in many children therapy could continue for as long as 12 years or more.<BR/>Not all girls with TS will need hGH treatment. A minority will reach a final height within the normal range without treatment and a few will be diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, it has become common practice to treat girls with TS with hGH and often with an anabolic steroid (for example, oxandrolone) as well.<BR/>Oestrogen is commonly administered in TS to promote puberty, but there does not appear to be any evidence that it is a growth-promoting agent - indeed, the opposite, as oestrogen therapy that was started at younger ages resulted in reduced final heights compared with girls in whom oestrogen was started later (for example, after age 14) (<LINK REF="REF-Saenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 1996</LINK>). It is now generally thought that it is important to administer hGH for as long as possible before starting oestrogen therapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>British National Formulary recommendations are that growth hormone therapy is contraindicated in cases of tumour activity and should not be used after renal transplant in seriously ill children or for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>). Side effects can include headache, visual problems, nausea and vomiting, fluid retention (peripheral oedema), arthralgia, myalgia, paraesthesia, antibody formation, hypothyroidism and reactions at injection site. There has been concern that growth hormone would induce new tumours or increase the likelihood of tumour relapse. Reports suggest, however, that the risk of new tumours or tumour recurrence is not elevated in children treated with growth hormone who have no other increased risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Blethen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blethen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frisch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frisch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GH-Soc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GH Soc 2001</LINK>). Antibody formation is generally not of clinical consequence, although in some patients this can be associated with growth rate deceleration (<LINK REF="REF-Blethen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blethen 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evaluating effects of growth hormone</HEADING>
<P>Height (and growth velocity, see below) is often reported in length units (cm) or in standard deviation scores (SDS).<BR/>The standard deviation is a measure of the variation of observations around the mean. Heights of populations of adults or children generally form normal distributions such that 95.4% of a population will have heights that fall within two standard deviations (SD) from the mean. Individual observations can be compared with heights corresponding to points on the height distribution for a particular age to determine how a child's (or adult's) height compares with their peers. Standard deviation score is defined by the formula: actual height minus mean height for age divided by standard deviation of height for age. Standard deviation scores using controlled data collected from an appropriate population base allow comparison of measures independent of age. In this system the normal population mean is zero and a normal SD score will lie between approximately -2 and +2 SD. A healthy individual's SDS will not change during the growth years. Increased SDS implies catch-up growth and a decrease implies growth failure.<BR/>The best measure of how recombinant growth hormone (hGH) affects growth is to measure final adult height (in cm or SDS). Measuring final height requires that the child has finished growing. The most reliable measures of final height use multiple criteria to determine that growth is complete or nearly complete. Generally, it is considered that children have completed or nearly completed their growth when their growth rate within a year has slowed to less than some specified amount (for example, 1 to 2 cm) and skeletal maturity assessed by radiographs of the wrist and hand indicate that the epiphyses have closed (often expressed as bone age greater than a certain value, for example, 14 to 15 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Frindik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frindik 1999</LINK>). Acknowledging that measures may be taken before growth is fully complete, 'near final height' is sometimes reported. This is a measure of height when it is presumed that growth is complete as discussed above.<BR/>Although the overall effectiveness of hGH in treating short stature is to be found in measures of final height, it has been argued that short-term measures of growth are also of importance. Children and parents may be concerned with whether growth within a certain time frame is comparable to that of a child's peers. Velocity may also be a better interim growth measure than height attained at a particular age as it is independent of growth in previous years.<BR/>Growth velocity (GV) is a measure of the height gained (cm) within a specified time period (usually a year). This outcome is also often referred to as 'height velocity.' Growth velocity can also be considered in relation to a child's age by considering growth velocity relative to the distribution of growth velocities for children of a particular age (growth velocity standard deviation score - GVSDS). As with height, growth velocity SDS measures are dependent upon the reference data used (<LINK REF="REF-Haeusler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haeusler 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Bone age is a measure of skeletal maturity. It is customarily determined by examining the relative positions of the bones in the left hand and wrist from a radiograph. The measurement of bone age relative to chronological age is important in height prediction models. In addition, bone age assessments are used to evaluate when the epiphyses have closed and growth is complete. Growth cannot occur after the epiphyses (ends of the long bones) have closed. The interim assessment of bone age is important in determining whether treatment is advancing bone maturity. Accelerated bone age in treated individuals would indicate that treatment was shortening the growth period and might therefore have the paradoxical effect of premature closure of the epiphyses and decreased final height. Therefore, if hGH were an effective growth promoting agent without inducing premature skeletal maturity, then there would be a lack of treatment effects on bone age.<BR/>It is of considerable interest to determine whether treatment with hGH affects children's sense of well-being or quality of life. A number of measures have been designed to assess quality of life. In addition, there are many measures of self-concept, psychosocial functioning and so on that might be affected by hGH treatment. Turner syndrome can include psychological or cognitive characteristics. It is therefore of interest to determine whether hGH treatment might affect cognitive functioning.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Existing evidence on the use of growth hormone in Turner syndrome</HEADING>
<P>Growth hormone has been used for some years in TS. Although many consider that hGH has demonstrated beneficial effects in increasing growth and height in girls with TS, the results from trials have been variable. Within trials there is also variation among individuals in response to treatment. Whether hGH is effective in increasing height in patients with TS is still somewhat controversial. How much height may be gained is also an important consideration as hGH treatment is quite costly.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>A recent review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of recombinant growth hormone in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Bryant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryant 2002</LINK>) included a model that suggested that approximately 97% of the cost of treating patients with Turner syndrome for short stature was drug (growth hormone) cost. This model showed that mean total cost of treatment assuming treatment for five years with a final height benefit of 4.4 to 4.8 cm was approximately £63,000 (93,909 EURO) resulting in an incremental cost per centimetre of final height gain of approximately £16,000 to £17,500 (23,850 EURO to 26,090 EURO).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Although there have been some reviews of the use of recombinant growth hormone in Turner syndrome (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyda-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyda 1999</LINK>), there have been no reviews that have used systematic methods to locate and evaluate the best possible evidence. For instance, existing reviews have not used methods that exhaustively searched the available literature for relevant trials.<BR/>Previous reviews have also included studies that have varied in the interventions used. These results combine not only the effects of hGH, but also in some cases effects of other concomitant interventions such as oxandrolone. Although it may eventually be demonstrated that height optimisation requires the use of multiple interventions, it is initially valuable to evaluate the effectiveness of hGH alone.</P>

<LI>final height: The gold standard outcome measure of effectiveness of growth hormone treatment is final height (in cm or height standard deviation [HtSDS] relative to a normal population). Height is often reported in standard deviations relative to some population. HtSDS gives an indication of height relative to other children of the same age or relative to other adults in the case of final height. HtSDS can also be reported relative to a population with TS.

<LI>final height: The gold standard outcome measure of effectiveness of growth hormone treatment is final height (in cm or height standard deviation [HtSDS] relative to a normal population). Height is often reported in standard deviations relative to some population. HtSDS gives an indication of height relative to other children of the same age or relative to other adults in the case of final height. HtSDS can also be reported relative to a population with TS. Although this measure would also indicate whether treated patients are taller than an untreated TS sample or population, this would not be the best comparison for evaluating a patient-relevant outcome.

<P>Randomised controlled trials that considered hGH against another active treatment rather than placebo or no treatment were excluded. The objective of the review was to consider the efficacy of hGH as a growth promoting treatment. Trials that compared hGH with other treatments known or presumed to affect growth would not be informative about the fundamental efficacy of hGH. Dose-response trials (which do not include a zero dose or placebo group) were also excluded as they do not address whether hGH works. Trials that compared hGH plus some other active treatment against only the active treatment were also excluded. In this type of design the effects of hGH may be different than when hGH is administered alone. Because the aim was to evaluate the effects of hGH, designs in which hGH may interact with another treatment were excluded.</P>

<P>All included studies were randomised controlled trials with parallel designs. Only one study used a placebo control whereas the others used a no treatment control. Therefore, the participants in three of the four studies were aware of their treatment status. The trials varied in the duration of the controlled phase. Although participants in all four of the primary studies were treated until they achieved final height, only the <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK> study maintained a control group until final height, with a small subset of girls participating in an addendum follow up. The <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kollmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kollmann 1991</LINK> studies maintained a control group for one year and the <LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK> study maintained a placebo control for 18 months.

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>) reported final height in both recombinant growth hormone (hGH) treated and untreated groups. Although the other included studies treated participants until final height was achieved, they did not maintain a control group until final height. In the <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK> study, the girls who were treated with hGH achieved a final height of 148 ± 6 cm and the girls who did not receive treatment achieved a final height of 141 ± 5 cm. This seven cm difference (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.0 to 8) was statistically significant. Likewise, the treated girls had a 1.6 ± 0.6 standard deviation change in their height standard deviation score (HtSDS) (age-specific Turner) from baseline whereas the untreated girls had a 0.3 ± 0.4 SD change in their HtSDS (age specific Turner) (mean difference (MD) 1.3 SD, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5). Normally, HtSDS does not change during growth so the change in HtSDS for the treated girls indicates catch-up growth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Height standard deviation score (HtSDS)</HEADING>
<P>Height standard deviation score can be measured at any point during growth and indicates height relative to other children (or adults) of the same age. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>) reported HtSDS scores for adult height at protocol completion. Ideally, one would compare the participants with Turner syndrome (TS) to normal girls of the same age as this is the comparison that is salient to the girls themselves. However, this study reported HtSDS using a TS population standard. HtSDS (age specific Turner) was 1.2 SD (95% CI 1.0 to 1.5) greater in treated than untreated girls and HtSDS (adult Turner) was 1.0 SD (95% CI 0.8 TO 1.3) greater at protocol completion. These were statistically significant differences.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Growth velocity (GV)</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported GV in cm per year. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 1989</LINK>) reported GV after one year of treatment. Treated girls grew approximately three cm more in the year than did untreated girls (MD 3 cm per year, 95% CI 2 to 4). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK>) reported GV after 18 months of treatment. GV was three cm per year (95% CI 2 to 3) greater in the treated girls (0.36 mg/kg/wk dose) than in the untreated girls. The <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK> study reported GV after two years of treatment that was two cm per year (95% CI 1.3 to 2.3) greater in treated girls than in untreated girls. These results suggest that growth improvements in treated girls does tend to decline over longer treatment intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Growth velocity standard deviation score (GVSDS)</HEADING>
<P>Growth velocity standard deviation score represents how quickly children are growing relative to their same age peers. As with HtSDS it would be ideal to compare girls with TS with their normal peers. However, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 1989</LINK>) that report GVSDS used a TS population standard. These two studies demonstrated that the GVSDS for the first year of treatment in treated girls was approximately three SD greater than in untreated girls (MD 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.6). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>) reported GVSDS after two years of treatment showing that GVSDS was 1.6 SD greater (95% CI 1.0 to 2.2) in hGH treated girls than in untreated girls. As with the GV results these results again suggest that increased growth declines over longer treatment intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bone age</HEADING>
<P>Bone age is a measure of skeletal maturity. If hGH treatment accelerates skeletal maturity, then growth benefits might be limited by a shorter overall growth period (i.e., treated children might grow faster, but stop growing sooner). If skeletal maturity is not accelerated by hGH treatment, then changes in bone age should approximate changes in chronological age such that a ratio of changes in bone age to chronological age should be approximately one. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>) reported the ratio of changes in bone age to changes in chronological age. After one year of treatment the difference in the ratio was 0.2 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.4). After two years of treatment the difference in the ratio was -0.1 (95% CI -0.5 to 0.3). Although statistics are underpowered to conclude that there is no difference in the ratios, hGH does not appear to accelerate bone age as the ratio of bone age to chronological age was approximately one at both time points in both treated and untreated groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Recombinant growth hormone (hGH) dose</HEADING>
<P>Although the current review was not undertaken to evaluate the effects of hGH dose, one included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK>) did include two hGH doses in addition to a placebo control. The two doses were 0.27 mg/kg/wk and 0.36 mg/kg/wk. Over 18 months of treatment the annualised growth velocity for girls on the two doses did not significantly differ (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.7). Other studies that manipulated hGH dose, but that did not include a placebo or no treatment control were not included in this review. Therefore, no strong conclusions should be drawn about hGH dose effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rovet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rovet 1993</LINK>) reported on psychological outcomes in relation to hGH treatment (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). This report was based on tests performed on a sub-group of the participants in the Canadian growth study (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>). These psychological results are not presented more formally because the reported results are a selection of the tests given to the children and their parents. The selective reporting of results leaves in doubt the nature of the unreported results. In addition, the reported results are based on a subset of the girls who were participating in the trial at the time and no explanation is offered for why the data from only a subset of the participants were presented. The fact that these evaluations are self-reports (or parent reports) in the context of an unblinded study should also be considered. Bearing in mind possible biases, the presented results suggest the possibility that girls treated with hGH do have better psychological adjustment than untreated girls.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Reporting of adverse effects was minimal. Two of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-93_x002f_98_x002f_05" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 93/98/05</LINK>) mentioned adverse effects (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> ). In the placebo controlled phase of the <LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK> trial, otitis media occurred or worsened in 29% of girls treated with hGH and in 13% of girls in the placebo group. The longer-term adverse effects reported from this trial were not reported separately for treatment groups. In the Canadian study there were significant differences in 'treatment emergent' adverse effects between the treated and control groups (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> ).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results available suggest that recombinant growth hormone (hGH) is effective in improving growth, final height and possibly psychological adjustment in girls with Turner syndrome (TS). Girls treated with hGH grew approximately three cm more in one year than did untreated girls and they grew approximately two cm per year more than untreated girls after two years. Expressing growth in growth velocity standard deviation (SD) scores reveals similar results. It does appear that initial growth improvements decline over longer treatment periods. However, there are insufficient data available to explicitly test this hypothesis.</P>
<P>The most important indicator of the efficacy of hGH for improving growth is the final height of women with TS who have been treated with hGH during their childhood. One study has reported final height results that show that final height was seven cm greater in women who had been treated with hGH than in women who remained untreated. The treated women had a 1.6 SD change in their height from baseline whereas the untreated women had a 0.3 SD change, again indicating that the treated women had catch up growth during treatment. Measures of bone age early in treatment did not indicate that bone age was accelerated and the eventual greater height of treated women supports the conclusion that hGH treatment does not accelerate skeletal maturation.</P>
<P>The current review was focused on a stringent evaluation of the efficacy of hGH in TS. For this reason evidence was limited to randomised controlled trials in which a control group received either placebo or no treatment. The presented results support the efficacy of hGH, particularly in improvement of growth and final height. It should be noted that these conclusions are supported by findings from other research designs in which treatment and control groups were not randomised or treated groups are compared with historical controls or with height predictions. Two of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 1998</LINK>) treated participants until final height but did not maintain the control group beyond the period included in this review. Both of these studies reported that the final height of treated women was improved relative to expectations. </P>
<P>The one included trial that evaluated final height did not report the average duration of hGH treatment. However, many currently available studies may not have treated participants optimally. Current recommendations are that treatment should be started early (ideally before age eight) and continue until final height is achieved. This would correspond to treatment for approximately eight years or longer. Most reported results are based on treatment for shorter durations. In addition, two of the included trials involved hGH injections three times per week. Current practice is to inject hGH six or seven times per week. Therefore final height improvements might be expected to be greater than reported here if hGH treatment is started earlier and dosing is optimised. <BR/> <BR/>There are concerns about attrition in the reported trials. The trial reporting final height had lost approximately one third of the participants at the time of reporting. It is possible that treated girls who were achieving a poor response would be more likely to leave the trial. Similarly, girls in the control group who were growing more slowly might be more likely to leave the trial. Both of these kinds of attrition would bias results, albeit in opposite directions.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were minimally reported. In the included trials there is little indication of serious adverse effects, however these small trials are seriously underpowered to detect rare events. Over longer term surveillance and outside the context of randomised controlled trials it seems that adverse effects are rare, but can be serious. Girls with TS may be at increased risk for a number of conditions that might be affected by hGH treatment such as diabetes mellitus, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, oedema and lymphoedema, or scoliosis (<LINK REF="REF-Blethen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blethen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frisch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frisch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GH-Soc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GH Soc 2001</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The reported results indicate that recombinant growth hormone (hGH) does improve growth and final height in girls with Turner syndrome (TS). The doses used in the included trials were approximately 0.3 to 0.375 mg/kg/wk (in one trial dose was computed by surface area). In one trial conducted to final height, hGH treatment increased final height in girls with TS by approximately seven cm. Although treated women are taller than untreated women, the final height achieved in treated women was approximately 148 cm. This is still below the normal range (i.e., more than 2 standard deviations below the normal mean) for adult women. Therefore it should be a matter for individual consideration as to whether this expected height gain is substantial enough to merit frequent or daily injections for probably 5 or more years. The cost of hGH is also substantial and it is a matter of debate as to whether the gains in height justify the expense. Finally, although serious adverse effects may be rare, as TS may already increase the risk of certain adverse effects, particular care should be taken to monitor girls with TS who are treated with hGH.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The current review has focused on a strict evaluation of the efficacy of hGH primarily for improving growth and final height. Within this context, additional trials that include a control group until final height and that conduct an intention to treat analysis would be very helpful to solidify the current findings. However, it may already be felt that the merits of hGH are sufficiently demonstrated that randomised control groups cannot be justified. If so, it is unfortunate that those making treatment decisions (patients, their parents and clinicians) will not know the extent to which hGH may affect final height under optimal treatment conditions. Although results from randomised controlled trials cannot be directly applied to individuals, there are problems with interpretation of results from studies based on surrogate measures of height improvement such as height prediction models (<LINK REF="REF-Taback-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taback 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the interest in the effects of hGH, treatment of short stature in girls with TS does not generally consist only of hGH. hGH is also often prescribed to girls with TS in combination with other growth-stimulating agents such as oxandrolone. If the efficacy of hGH has been adequately demonstrated, then focus should move to trials in which combinations of agents, doses, and timings are manipulated. Although there is merit in demonstrating short-term growth effects for such manipulations, these trials should be conducted with unchanging conditions until final height is achieved. </P>
<P>Existing evidence seems to indicate that growth and final height can be improved in TS. Perhaps the more pressing research question now is the cost-effectiveness of such treatment. To optimally evaluate cost effectiveness requires a good estimate of clinical effectiveness. This should not depend upon surrogate measures of efficacy such as changes from predicted height or comparison with a historical control, but should be based upon comparison between randomised groups of patients who receive hGH treatment and who do not. It may already be too late to collect more such data.</P>
<P>A full consideration of the costs and benefits of hGH treatment in TS should include not only effects on height, but other outcomes such as psychological or cognitive effects, which in the past have received little attention in the evaluation ofhGH in TS.<BR/> </P>

<P>Outcome measures: Limited to psychological assessment with subjective ratings by child and parents in unblinded study. No objective confirmation of reports. Study not blinded, so cannot exclude differing input to those on active compared to no treatment (whether from parents / researchers). Short term outcomes (18 months treatment). Dropout analysis apparently based on 65 participants among whom the dropout was considerably greater in treated than untreated.
