<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-17 11:34:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aromatherapy is the use of pure essential oils from fragrant plants (such as peppermint, sweet marjoram, and rose) to help relieve health problems and improve the quality of life in general. The healing properties of aromatherapy are claimed to include promotion of relaxation and sleep, relief of pain, and reduction of depressive symptoms. Hence, aromatherapy has been used to reduce disturbed behaviour, to promote sleep, and to stimulate motivational behaviour of people with dementia. Of the seven randomised controlled trials that we found, only two trials including 186 people had useable data. The analysis of these two small trials showed inconsistent effects of aromatherapy on measures of agitation, behavioural symptoms and quality of life. More large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before firm conclusions can be reached about the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-15 01:25:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complementary therapy has received great interest within the field of dementia treatment and the use of aromatherapy and essential oils is increasing. In a growing population where the majority of patients are treated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the efficacy of treatment is short term and accompanied by negative side effects. Utilisation of complimentary therapies in dementia care settings presents as one of few options that are attractive to practitioners and families as patients often have reduced insight and ability to verbally communicate adverse reactions. Amongst the most distressing features of dementia are the behavioural and psychological symptoms. Addressing this facet has received particular interest in aromatherapy trials, with a shift in focus from reducing cognitive dysfunction to the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-15 01:28:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A>, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, was searched on 26 November 2012 and 20 January 2013 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-15 01:29:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials were considered. A minimum length of a trial and requirements for follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity. The review considered all trials using fragrance from plants defined as aromatherapy as an intervention with people with dementia and all relevant outcomes were considered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-15 05:44:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review. For Burns 2011, continuous outcomes were estimated as the mean difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval using a fixed-effect model. For Ballard 2002, analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the nursing home being treated as a random effect.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-15 01:38:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Seven studies with 428 participants were included in this review; only two of these had published usable results. Individual patient data were obtained from one trial (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed. The additional analyses conducted using individual patient data from Ballard 2002 revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aromatherapy intervention on measures of agitation (n = 71, MD -11.1, 95% CI -19.9 to -2.2) and behavioural symptoms (n = 71, MD -15.8, 95% CI -24.4 to -7.2). Burns 2011, however, found no difference in agitation (n = 63, MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.36), behavioural symptoms (n = 63, MD 2.80, 95% CI -5.84 to 11.44), activities of daily living (n = 63, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.79) and quality of life (n = 63, MD 19.00, 95% CI -23.12 to 61.12). Burns 2011 and Fu 2013 found no difference in adverse effects (n = 124, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.46) when aromatherapy was compared to placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-15 01:39:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The benefits of aromatherapy for people with dementia are equivocal from the seven trials included in this review. It is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with the included studies. More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aromatherapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-18 11:02:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-18 11:02:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia presents as a major healthcare challenge with over 24 million people suffering from the condition and with a projected estimate of the numbers to double every 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2007</LINK>). The pathogenesis of dementia remains unclear despite the growing evidence base for attributing factors and their role in the characteristic neurodegeneration that occurs in this condition (for example <LINK REF="REF-Iadecola-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iadecola 2010</LINK>). Dementia is a disabling human affliction with devastating consequences to the person and those known to them, creating inherent challenges for the personal and professional systems that are in place to provide support and best meet their needs (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2007</LINK>). With limited capacity to delay the decline of cognitive function in patients with dementia, the field of aromatherapy attempts to alleviate the distress that manifests through challenging and complex behavioural and psychological expressions of confusion (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). Although deterioration of explicit memory is a defining characteristic of dementia there is evidence to suggest that implicit memory can remain intact in patients with the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischman 2005</LINK>). The suggestion has been made that the olfactory sense may link in with an implicit odour memory (<LINK REF="REF-Degel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degel 2001</LINK>). It is reported that people with dementia have, as a population, a greater prevalence of degrees of anosmia (the inability to perceive odours) and that differing forms of dementia may be associated with slightly different aspects of anosmia (<LINK REF="REF-Luzzi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzzi 2007</LINK>), although people with Alzheimer's disease are not significantly more likely to be anosmic than controls (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-15 05:18:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complementary (or alternative) therapies have become more commonly used over the last decade and have been applied to a wide range of health problems, including in care for people with dementia. Therapies have included massage (for example <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2010</LINK>), aromatherapy (for example <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2008</LINK>), acupuncture (for example <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>), and herbal medicine (for example <LINK REF="REF-Perry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2011</LINK>). Evidence exists that complementary medicine use is a substantial and growing part of healthcare behaviour in Europe, Australia and North America (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>), and aromatherapy is one of the main complementary therapies to be practised by nurses and other healthcare professionals in hospital, hospice, and community settings (<LINK REF="REF-Buckle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckle 2003</LINK>). It tends to be seen as a relatively non-invasive procedure and is probably the complementary therapy most familiar to consumers.</P>
<P>Aromatherapy is a part of the discipline of phytotherapy (the use of whole plants or parts of plants for medicinal purposes) and uses pure essential oils from fragrant plants (such as peppermint, sweet marjoram, and rose) to help relieve health problems and improve quality of life in general (<LINK REF="REF-OnHealth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">OnHealth 2000</LINK>). Essential oils have been defined as "highly fragrant essences extracted from plants by distillation, which evaporate readily" (<LINK REF="REF-Tisserand-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisserand 1988</LINK>) and have been used by doctors in France for their antibiotic and antiviral properties for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Tisserand-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisserand 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Essential oils are many and varied, with presumed different potential effects. These are claimed to include promotion of relaxation and sleep, relief of pain, and reduction of depressive symptoms (for example <LINK REF="REF-Halycon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halycon 2000</LINK>), the rationale being that the essential oils have a calming and de-stressing effect. As such, aromatherapy might be of use as an intervention for people who have little or no preserved language function, are confused, or for whom verbal interaction is difficult and current conventional medicine is seen as of only marginal benefit. Aromatherapy has, therefore, been used to address behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia such as to reduce disturbed behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2008</LINK>), promote sleep (for example <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1996</LINK>), and stimulate motivational behaviour (for example <LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Essential oils selected for aromatherapy have very low toxicity profiles and, if administered by qualified practitioners, present as a safer option than conventional pharmacological medications (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2006</LINK>). Whilst there is little doubt that properly administered aromatherapy is free of any of the side effects that can be associated with pharmacological drugs, the properties of essential oils are unlike the precisely formulated pharmacological medications as standardisation of extraction techniques for complimentary therapies are highly variable across manufacturers (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2003</LINK>). However, there are well established systems of quality control (<LINK REF="REF-Shinde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinde 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turek-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turek 2013</LINK>) and some manufacturers produce standardised extracts to achieve a within manufacturer consistency, similar to pharmaceutical quality (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-15 05:11:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The essential oils used in aromatherapy are most commonly delivered through electric diffusers and vaporizers or massaged into the skin, thus the aroma of the essential oil evaporates and stimulates the olfactory sense (<LINK REF="REF-Kong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2009</LINK>). This is often then linked with a psychological response as past experience may affect the person's response in accordance with connotations of the aroma (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2004</LINK>). The emotional significance of an odour is provided by the role of the amygdala in the cerebral analysis of this (<LINK REF="REF-Zald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zald 1997</LINK>). Thus there is increasing interest in any pharmacological action of aroma therapeutics and the terpenes found in aromatherapy essential oils, for example there have been results relating to the ability of essential oils to improve neurotransmission by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and increasing acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons to delay the neurological degeneration and cognitive decline that is characteristic in dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Arruda-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arruda 2012</LINK>). In addition, the use of complementary therapy as a co-adjuvant to pharmacological medicines would potentially be well received as the elderly population are frequent users of complementary and alternative therapies to compensate for aspects they perceive to be absent in conventional medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Moses-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The modes of delivery of essential oils are varied and the quantity delivered to each person through means such as vaporising or skin massage is dependent upon the volume of oil, temperature, room size and air flow, and the quality is dependent upon factors that can influence the content and concentration of constituents, such as agriculture, storage and processing factors (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2003</LINK>). Evidence suggests that isolating and investigating in vivo qualities of oils is required to understand the oil's pharmacokinetic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Tariku-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tariku 2010</LINK>) and further investigation to identify the bioactivities of oils is becoming increasingly important and a growing area of research (<LINK REF="REF-Shaaban-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaaban 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-15 05:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite an increase in popularity and regular use, the rationale for aromatherapy is based on limited scientific research, with the majority of evidence from case studies as opposed to controlled clinical trials. Additionally, despite the implementation of regulatory processes such as the European (EU) Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive, the absence of a regulatory body to approve the manufacturing practice of unlicensed products makes it impossible to identify those that reach acceptable standards, and the safety around their use remains unclear. As such, the need remains for the effects of aromatherapy to be adequately documented.</P>

<P>The risk of bias tool examines five key domains for bias: selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, and reporting bias. Each domain was assessed and classified as either a low or a high risk of bias, and where insufficient detail was reported in a study to assess the risk this was reported as 'unclear'. In addition, we reported any other form of bias noted in the study.</P>

<P>Where studies used a cross-over method, we used only data from the first phase of the trial. If they did not report the results separately for each phase we did not add the data to the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There was one included cluster-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>) where eight homes were matched in pairs and within each pair the homes were randomised to treatment or control. Thus, the unit of randomisation was the home. Since the residents within homes were not the units of randomisation, the mean assessments of all residents within a home were the outcomes values for each home. Analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the home being treated as a random effect. The change from baseline was analysed for all outcomes. The treatment effect for an outcome was the difference between the overall means of the four homes on treatment and the four homes on placebo. The contribution from each home was weighted and this weight depended on the precision of the mean value for each home. The PROC MIXED procedure in SAS® was used for all analyses.</P>

<P>Professor Ballard allowed us access to the individual patient data from his cluster-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>), and we were able to perform analyses additional to those that had been published. Analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the home being treated as a random effect. The PROC MIXED procedure in SAS® was used for all analyses. There were several participant level covariates that could be included in the model, such as age, sex, baseline outcomes, and those describing the medication being taken (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). When tested in the model for each outcome the only medication variable that had a significant effect was whether the patient was taking atypical neuroleptics. Sex and the baseline value of the outcome measure also had significant effects. Therefore, the estimate of the treatment effect was adjusted for sex, baseline measure of the outcome, and use of atypical neuroleptic medication.</P>

<P>Five trials measured agitation on three scales. Participants were less agitated in the aromatherapy group in two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; the latter was a cross-over study only reporting overall data. Three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2013</LINK>) found no difference in participants' levels of agitation, although <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011</LINK> did not report any actual data and <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2013</LINK> did not report data separately for each treatment group. The results from two studies that measured behavioural symptoms were highly heterogeneous, with <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK> showing an effect in favour of aromatherapy and <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK> finding no treatment effect. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2013</LINK> also found no difference in observed behaviour between aromatherapy and placebo. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2013</LINK>) showed no difference in adverse effects, and a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK>) showed no difference in quality of life and activities of daily living of participants treated with aromatherapy compared to those treated with placebo.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-17 11:34:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although seven studies are included in this review, we were very limited in the data we could use in analyses. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK>) reported data on agitation and behaviour that could be used. Furthermore, in <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK> the participants that were included were taking a range of medication, including antipsychotics and neuroleptics; any of these could have been altered during the trial, which may have had a confounding effect on the results. In <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2011</LINK> participants were free of psychotropic medication (antipsychotics or cholinesterase inhibitors, or both) for at least two weeks before the study began, so any confounding effects of medication were less likely.</P>
<P>The length of follow-up was short in these two studies, only four to 12 weeks, and both were conducted in nursing homes in the UK, limiting the applicability of the results to other countries and settings.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that we were unable to include data from the other five trials in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Smallwood-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smallwood 2001</LINK> did not report any useable data, <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2013</LINK> only reported useable data for adverse events, and <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2013</LINK> were cross-over trials that only reported results from the two phases of the trial combined. The results of a cross-over trial are not usually considered suitable when studying an intervention for a progressive disease. Treatment effect is estimated from the within patient changes for the two periods and assumes that the patient's baseline assessment is the same at the start of each of the two phases. This assumption is difficult to justify for a progressive disease. Although <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK> states there was no deterioration between the two phases, the data for each group are not presented separately. We would prefer to rely on the data from the first phase only, but these were not reported and have not been forthcoming from the author. Therefore this study did not contribute to the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>There are several essential oils currently being used that may not be comparable. Furthermore, the mode of administration differed between trials, although the two trials that had useable data both applied melissa oil topically. There is also great variation in assessment procedures and outcomes reported, and some have not controlled for other variables such as medication use. There is also the possibility that, as with antidementia drugs, aromatherapy might have different effects on people with different types or severity of dementia.</P>

<P>The overall quality of the evidence, based on GRADE, is very low. Four out of the seven studies did not report any data that we could use in the analysis, and the three studies that did report data were small with short follow-ups. <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK> was a cluster-randomised trial and there might have been variation between the eight nursing homes included in the study that was not accounted for in the adjusted analysis, which could have confounded the results from this trial.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fung-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 2012</LINK> is a systematic review on the use of aromatherapy in treating behavioural problems in dementia. <LINK REF="STD-Fung-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 2012</LINK> reports that there is some evidence that aromatherapy has a positive effect on cognitive functioning and reducing BPSDs. However, although the review stated that they included only RCTs, six of the 11 included studies were not randomised and one was not testing aromatherapy, and so we have not included these studies in our review; accounting for the differences in our results.</P>
<P>The great majority of reported research on aromatherapy for people with dementia is of scientifically inadequate quality. In view of the possibility of a host of biases, no conclusions can be drawn from these studies. The reports can, however, give indications to inform researchers in the design of studies investigating aromatherapy. It is beyond the scope of this systematic review to give an account of all these studies, however, a representative selection that includes different study methodologies follows below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Burleigh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burleigh 1997</LINK> used an ABAB design to assess the effects of lavender, Roman chamomile, rosemary, and marjoram on the Behaviour Assessment Scale of Later Life (<LINK REF="REF-Brooker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooker 1993</LINK>) of seven participants with dementia. They found a significant reduction of challenging behaviour for four of the five female participants, but an increase of challenging behaviour for the two male participants. Six of the participants additionally showed a decreased need for assistance with activities of daily living. Curiously this is one of very few trials that adhere to one of the main principles of aromatherapy, the selection of oils based upon characteristics of each patient. Via this process different oils are often given for the same problems in different patients. <LINK REF="STD-West-1994" TYPE="STUDY">West 1994</LINK> reported a single-case study of the effects of 'aromatic oils' on the sleeping pattern of a person with dementia. Their results showed an improvement of sleep patterns and a decrease of agitation. <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1996</LINK> assessed the effects of lavender and Roman chamomile on sleep patterns in two people with severe dementia who acted as their own controls. There was a mean increase of peaceful sleep for one participant, but a mean decrease of peaceful sleep for the other participant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kilstoff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kilstoff 1998</LINK> used the action research method, which is a qualitative method encouraging participants to design, implement, and evaluate an intervention, to assess the effects of lavender, mandarin, and geranium with hand massage on 16 recipients of day-care who had dementia. The findings indicated a perceived strengthening of the relationship between the people with dementia and their carers, and an improvement in feelings of health and well-being for both recipients and carers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1998</LINK> reported a single-participant AB design study of the effects of an aromatherapy intervention, 'Zeal', on the motivational behaviour of one person with dementia. The results show a significant improvement on the rating scale employed. Vetrivanathan (reference unavailable) used The Brief Agitation Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Finkel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkel 1993</LINK>) and The Relaxation Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Luiselli-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luiselli 1982</LINK>) to evaluate the effects of lavender and massage on seven participants with dementia on an acute assessment ward. The results from this study showed some short term decrease of agitation, an increase in relaxation one hour after the intervention, but a decrease in relaxation before and immediately after the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK> used a cross-over design with nine patients with dementia in a hospital ward to investigate the effects of lavender, using sleep charts as outcome measure. The results showed a significant increase in duration of sleep (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2002</LINK> studied 13 older people with dementia living in residential care. All participants were described as being consistently resistive to medication administration, and had displayed an ability to perceive aromas. Each participant was exposed to three different aromas by means of a cotton ball taped to their clothing 20 minutes before medication was administered. The essential oils used were lavender, sweet orange, and tea tree, with no aroma as the control condition. Duration of medication administration and frequency and duration of resistive behaviour during this was used as the outcome, but no significant differences were found.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bowles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bowles 2002</LINK> used a cross-over design to investigate the effects of lavender, sweet marjoram, patchouli, and vetiver on resistance to nursing care procedures and the frequency and duration of 'dementia-related behaviours' (aggression etc.). The participants were 56 (36 after attrition) aged care facility residents with moderate to severe dementia. The essential oils were blended into an aqueous cream and massaged onto the bodies and limbs of the residents five times a day, and behaviour was recorded throughout the eight weeks of the trial. The control condition was cream only. They found a significant decrease in 'dementia-related behaviours' occurring at times other than during nursing care, while resistance to nursing care increased for half of the participants. A significant improvement was also found on the Mini-Mental State Evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) for some participants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1997</LINK> reported on the effects of massage and lavender, separately and in conjunction with each other, on the disturbed behaviour of four people with dementia on a continuing care ward. The researchers developed individualized disturbed behaviour scales, which they tested for inter-rater reliability (P &lt; 0.001). The results from this study showed a significant difference following the aromatherapy for one participant. For two participants, the massage and aromatherapy was associated with an increase of agitated behaviour.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2002</LINK> investigated the effects of lavender on agitated behaviour in 15 patients with severe dementia on a long-stay psychogeriatric ward. This was a placebo-controlled trial with blinded ratings, with the participants acting as their own controls. The outcome measure used was the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1994</LINK>). The results show a significant mean improvement of the aromatherapy group, but five of the participants showed no change and one a worsening of agitated behaviour.</P>
<P>In finding some support for a beneficial effect of aromatherapy for people with dementia, the literature indicates that further, more adequate research is needed. Of equal importance are the findings of some adverse effects following aromatherapy, questioning the widespread assumption that it at least does no harm.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-15 07:04:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is plenty of non-randomised evidence of both benefit and harm for aromatherapy for dementia. The seven randomised trials included in this review show equivocal evidence for the benefits of aromatherapy, and further evidence for its effectiveness is needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-02-17 11:34:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A promising start has been made in systematically investigating the effect of aromatherapy on the experience of dementia, however more well-designed, large-scale RCTs that fully report the data are needed before conclusions can be drawn as to its effectiveness. Many methodological issues need to be addressed such as the comparability of different interventions, the quality of the blinding, and the placebo effect. Treatment effects for the different types and severity of dementia, as well as other variables including sex and age, also need to be investigated. The various types of aromatherapy interventions, including lavender, Roman chamomile, mandarin, geranium, marjoram, melissa, patchouli, vetiver, sweet orange, and tea tree, and combinations, should be considered when designing future trials as well as the level of training of those administering the aromatherapy intervention, from completely untrained members of care staff teams to trained aromatherapists, with different modes of application, frequencies and dosages. Trials should use standardised, well validated instruments and more long term follow-up assessments. See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for the recommended design of future trials.</P>

<P>We searched ALOIS (<A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois</A>) - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 26 November 2012. The search terms used were: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils.</P>
<P>ALOIS is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy. The studies are identified from:  </P>
<OL>
<LI>Monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Psycinfo and Lilacs</LI>
<LI>Monthly searches of a number of trial registers: ISRCTN; UMIN (Japan's Trial Register); the WHO portal (which covers ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; the Chinese Clinical Trials Register; the German Clinical Trials Register; the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials and the Netherlands National Trials Register, plus others)</LI>
<LI>Quarterly search of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>&#8217;s Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)</LI>
<LI>Six-monthly searches of a number of grey literature sources: ISI Web of Knowledge Conference Proceedings; Index to Theses; Australasian Digital Theses</LI>
</OL>
<P>To view a list of all sources searched for ALOIS see <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/content/about-alois">About ALOIS</A> on the ALOIS website.</P>
<P>Details of the search strategies used for the retrieval of reports of trials from the healthcare databases, CENTRAL and conference proceedings can be viewed in the &#8216;methods used in reviews&#8217; section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/DEMENTIA/frame.html">Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group</A>.</P>
<P>Additional searches were performed in many of the sources listed above to cover the timeframe from the last searches performed for ALOIS to ensure that the search for the review was as up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible. The search strategies used can be seen <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Electronic searches carried out in the previous version(s) of the review can be viewed in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources  </HEADING>
<P>'Experts' in the field of complementary therapies were contacted to identify ongoing and unpublished research as well as the Aroma Therapy Organisations Council.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>LMT and AS independently screened the titles and abstracts extracted by the searches for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review based on the above criteria, which were discussed with MO.</P>
<P>Update Sept. 2008: FEH and TPHB assessed the new study found by the March 2008 search using the same criteria as that previously used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports and unpublished company reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available. For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior. For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If ITT data were not available an analysis of patients who completed treatment was conducted. For continuous or ordinal variables which can be approximated to continuous variables, the main outcomes of interest were the assessment score at the time point being considered and the change from the baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) at this time point. For some binary and ordinal outcomes the endpoint category relative to baseline category was the outcome of interest. For other categorical outcomes, such as the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), the endpoint itself was of clinical relevance as all patients had begun, by definition, at the same baseline score. The baseline assessment score was the latest available score, no longer than two months prior to the randomization. Studies may have included a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. The data from these non-randomized titration periods were not used to assess safety or efficacy since patients were not randomized, nor was treatment or dose allocation concealed. Data from any open follow-on phase, after the randomized phase, were not used to assess safety or efficacy for the same reasons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>A checklist for assessing the quality of all studies identified was developed, as presented below.<BR/>
<BR/>Checklist for assessing methodological quality.<BR/>Does the paper include:<BR/>1) A thorough review of the literature?<BR/>2) Hypothesis formulation/aims/power analysis?<BR/>3) Details of informed consent?<BR/>4) Description/justification of sampling procedure?<BR/>5) Description/justification of design (for non RCTs)?<BR/>6) Justification of lack of controls (for non RCTs)?<BR/>7) Details of randomization method(s) (selection bias)?<BR/>8) Number/details of drop-outs (attrition bias)?<BR/>9) Description/justification/standardization of outcome measures?<BR/>10) Blind assessment/details of assessor(s) (detection bias)?<BR/>11) Clearly presented results (appropriate statistics)?<BR/>12) A description of limitations of study/design (for non RCTs)?<BR/>13) Intention to treat analysis?<BR/>14) Suggestions for future research?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio was used to measure treatment effect.</P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, functional and quality of life scales, there are two possible approaches. If ordinal scale data appear to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators perform suggests parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data. The second approach, which may not have excluded the first, was to concatenate into 2 categories which best represent the contrasting states of interest, and to treat the variable as binary. For binary outcomes such as institutionalization and death, the endpoint itself was of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio was used.</P>
<P>A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials was calculated. Overall estimates of the treatment difference are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic performed. Where there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model is used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>
