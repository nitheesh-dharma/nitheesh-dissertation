<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Burkitt lymphoma is an important cancer, particularly in children. It is a fast growing tumour but also very sensitive to chemotherapy. It presents a challenge in endemic areas due to late presentation and an often incomplete complement of drugs available for treatment. Different regimens are in use for treatment with varied success rates. This review aims to evaluate these treatments to assess their effectiveness especially for later stages. The review identified 13 trials involving 1824 participants. However, data presentable for the review were only available in 10 trials with 732 participants. The data were difficult to collate because of the quality of the study methods and the reporting of the results; outcome measures differed between trials and they were mainly small-sized trials. No significant differences in overall survival were seen between studies aimed at inducing remission. Adverse events reported were mostly due to infections and reductions in blood cell counts. The more recent studies were focused on using less intensive treatment regimens as they could provide similar responses with lower risk of adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated and re-ran the searches in the following electronic databases from the time of the first publication; the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2011); MEDLINE (January 2011); EMBASE (January 2011); and the clinical trials registry (up to January 2011) to identify relevant trials. In addition, we also updated the search of the US clinical trials register for on-going and completed trials up to January 2011. We also updated the search terms and used the Cochrane filter for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any duration. We included studies conducted in children with a confirmed diagnosis of BL. We did not restrict studies by geographical location or by language of publication. We considered any therapeutic intervention. The primary outcome was overall survival.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed studies for relevance. We assessed studies that met the entry criteria for study quality. We independently extracted data and entered the data into Review Manager (RevMan). In this update, two review authors independently assessed citations from the updated search and reviewed abstracts for relevance.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included one new study in this update. In total, 13 trials involving 1824 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review however, data in usable format were only available in 10 trials (732 participants). Inadequate reporting of study methodology was a common feature of the trials preventing thorough assessment of study quality. We were unable to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the differences between the interventions assessed in the studies. Eight studies aimed to induce remission; overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Five studies aimed to maintain remission. In two out of three studies reporting survival, this was substantial but the difference was not statistically significant between treatment groups. Less aggressive treatment schedules appear to produce similar effects with less adverse event profiles.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review notes a preference in more recent studies for less aggressive care options for treatment of BL. However, the evidence for the relative effectiveness of interventions to treat BL is not strong as studies were small, underpowered and prone to both systematic and random error. We included one additional trial without change of conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common childhood cancer in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1990</LINK>). In 1958 Dennis Burkitt first described this cancer in Ugandan children in East Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Burkitt-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkitt 1958</LINK>). Epidemiological observations show a spread of the tumour in areas approximately 15 degrees north and south of the equator. In this area, this cancer presents predominantly as jaw swellings. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria groups BL in the subgroup of mature B-cell neoplasms (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>). This categorisation of BL includes the classic form of BL and a variant, Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL). In addition, three subcategories; endemic, non-endemic and immunodeficiency-associated have been defined to reflect the main clinical and genetic subtypes of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>). Current WHO classification describes it as a small non-cleaved cell lymphoma. These epidemiological and clinical characteristics distinguish endemic BL from other variants of small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (SNCCL) (<LINK REF="REF-Magrath-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magrath 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>HIV-associated BL, on the other hand represents an AIDS-defining criterion as it was observed to occur more frequently in those with HIV infection than the normal population (<LINK REF="REF-Knowles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowles 2003</LINK>). Patients were younger, with higher mean CD4 counts (usually &gt; 200 cells/&#956;l) compared with other HIV+ patients with diffuse large B-cell type non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) (<LINK REF="REF-Knowles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowles 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Maza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Maza 2002</LINK>). Sites of predilection include lymph nodes, bone marrow and extranodal sites, most often in the abdomen. HIV is not believed to be directly involved in lymphomagenesis (the growth and development of lymphoma) but rather via cytokine deregulation, chronic antigenic stimulation and decreased immune surveillance (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Maza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Maza 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>As its description suggests, sporadic BL occurs with no specific geographic or climatic association. It accounts for 1% to 2% of lymphomas in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Blum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tumour incidence is estimated to be around 1:10,000 children (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1990</LINK>), accounting for most cases of NHL in some series. It is more common in males, with a sex ratio of about 2:1. Peak occurrence is seven years (range 5 to 16 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Oguonu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oguonu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>The hypothesis of endemic BL comprises three components: (1) an early infection by the Epstein-Barr virus resulting in transformation and immortalisation of B-lymphocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Sugimoto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugimoto 2004</LINK>); (2) in areas of high malaria prevalence, this process is enhanced with suppression of T-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1990</LINK>). However, these may only result in a malignant change in the presence of translocation between chromosomes t(8;14), t(2;8), and t(8;22). In this new site, c-Myc oncogene activity is lost, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation of B-cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bernheim-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernheim 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis is often based on histology and cytological examination of biopsy specimens, although the gold standard for the diagnosis is considered to be immunophenotyping which shows the presence of the t(8;14) (q24;q32) and its variants or c-Myc rearrangement (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>). The clinical staging of the disease proposed by Ziegler and Magrath is widely accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1974</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endemic BL is very sensitive to chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Smeland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1972</LINK>), although other variants are less so. Surgery is rarely required to reduce symptomatic tumour bulk (<LINK REF="REF-Magrath-1974a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magrath 1974a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magrath-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magrath 1989</LINK>). The prognosis following effective chemotherapy is estimated to exceed 80% event-free survival for limited-stages disease (stages A, B, AR, A = solitary tumour limited to the face, B = multiple tumour on the face, AR = intra-abdominal tumour which is 90% resectable). Radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Norlin-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norlin 1971</LINK>) and immunotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Magrath-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magrath 1974</LINK>) have been tried as interventions and have shown variable degrees of success. The average cost of treatment is about US$164 (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, mortality from endemic BL remains high despite the fact that the disease is potentially curable. Limited access to health care, late presentation and higher relapse rates with late-stage disease contribute to these high mortality rates (<LINK REF="REF-Olweny-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olweny 1980</LINK>). Improving access to effective chemotherapy in endemic areas would contribute considerably to the reduction of the mortality rate. Several regimens have been introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Cairo-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairo 2003b</LINK>). However, there is little consensus on the best regimen for the tumour at various stages. This systematic review aims to assess the various interventions in order to provide the best options for these patients. This update has involved an updated search for trials, revisions in the methods and formatting of the structure.</P>

<P>In the protocol for this review, we stated that we would include trials of children aged up to 20 years with cancer confirmed by clinical and histopathologic features to be BL, irrespective of HIV/AIDS status. We also stated that we would restrict studies to those conducted in areas of endemic malaria. However, we revised the latter criterion because we agreed that the primary concern of the review was assessment of interventions in people with a confirmed diagnosis of BL. We did record geographical location of the trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overview of findings</HEADING>
<P>With one additional study, 13 studies have now been included involving 1824 participants without change of conclusion. The results presented are still based on ten studies with 732 participants. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cairo-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 2003a</LINK> could not be analysed as they were presented as proportions and in <LINK REF="STD-Patte-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2007</LINK>, results are presented as per comparison groups. We maintained the original format of the review to present results based on the overall intent of the studies; induction of remission or maintaining remission (patients were randomised after remission had been induced; details of induction were sometimes incomplete). In all studies, we were hampered in assessing the risk of bias by unclear description of the methods used (stated and implied, or both), the definition of study targets and reporting of results. Studies on interventions for inducing remission appear to be better reported and indicate some evidence of effect for our assessed outcomes at the two-year, follow-up time point. The interpretation of the evidence must however consider the context of the variations in study designs and endpoints. The outcomes for this review were not uniformly reported in the studies, thereby making combination of results and their subsequent analysis difficult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Context of studies</HEADING>
<P>As in the original version of this review, relatively little has changed with BL in terms of the age, sex, disease presentation and progression. The reclassification and definition of standard methods of diagnosis provided better ways of understanding the disease process and has improved the potential for pooling resources and participants in multicentre trials. These are likely to provide better estimates of the effects of the interventions. This also means that the findings of these results gain a more global applicability. There appears to be no new research activities in areas that were classically described as endemic for the disease. There, the main research interest also appears to shift towards comparisons of the effectiveness of lower dosage versions of regimens that have been shown to have effect (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2007</LINK>), with the aim to evaluate their performance in comparative survival and a lower adverse-effect profile. This is encouraging as it addresses one of the observations of the original review that the use of regimens are more likely to be determined by the quality of supportive care available.<BR/>
<BR/>The trials also involved other subsets of NHL. This could influence the results if the effect of disease characteristics on outcomes were not considered. Burkitt lymphoma has been reported in children with HIV/AIDS but this is not represented as either their serology status was not reported or those patients with HIV were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>).</P>

<P>The lack of data on HIV/AIDS-related BL prevented subgroup analysis. Most studies were described as randomised but methods were often not described. Blinding was not undertaken for many of the interventions and the quality of reporting of these trials was also generally quite poor. The pattern of reporting shows an emphasis on overall survival, remission or relapse rates and event-free survival; no study described the quality of life of the survivors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Closing remarks</HEADING>
<P>This update identified one new study on the treatment of BL (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2007</LINK>). However, as observed previously, a detailed analysis of the data was not possible due to the format in which the data were presented. There is some evidence on the effect of these treatment combinations but the size and direction may be difficult to determine due to differences in reporting formats. The improved characterisation of cancers is invaluable as it may be influential to the use of treatment regimens for various types and stages of disease as seen in the more recent studies and perhaps reflect on reporting of trials. Further updates of the review may consider the revising definitions of the disease and perhaps focus on broader categories currently in use in literature. Newer studies appear to focus on revisions of existing treatment protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2007</LINK>); a trend towards balancing between efficacy and reduction in morbidity and adverse events.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Existing treatment protocols show encouraging responses in terms of response and survival rates, perhaps due to better designs. The use of less-intensive protocols appear to produce similar responses compared with standard regimens with possibly lower adverse-event profiles. Issues around the context of the level of supportive care available, participant selection criteria and the quality of life of study participants are other determinants to the widespread use of treatment regimens. Efforts to increase access should also consider raising awareness on the disease and sources of treatment since early-stage disease is associated with better outcomes with existing drugs. There is little data on treatment options for relapse.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-10 13:14:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The progress in research in this field has focused on better characterisation of the disease process but comparatively less progress has been reported on improvements to treatment regimens and outcomes. The current trend appears to be the evaluation of the efficacy of current and perhaps new drug combinations in terms of induction and maintenance of remission. This can be deduced from the <LINK REF="STD-Patte-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patte-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2007</LINK> studies. Other issues would relate to clear data reporting on outcomes to help with comparisons between studies. There has been some interest in the use of immunotherapeutic agents such monoclonal antibodies in patients with B-cell malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Kasamon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasamon 2004</LINK>). Results suggest a possible role in BL but these are based on small observations (<LINK REF="REF-Akbayram-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akbayram 2010</LINK>).</P>
