<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-20 10:34:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Carcinosarcomas of the uterus (womb) are uncommon cancers accounting for 4.3% of all cancers of the womb. These rare cancers have poor prognosis; one of the reasons for the poor survival outcome is the fact that over a third of these cancers (carcinosarcomas) have already spread beyond the womb at the time of diagnosis.</P>
<P>The main treatment is surgery to remove the cancer, however, because of the high rates of both local and distant recurrence after surgery, effective adjuvant therapies are needed. This review has shown that women with high stage disease (stage III-IV persistent or recurrent disease) who received combination chemotherapy including ifosfamide had a lower risk of death and disease progression than women who received ifosfamide alone, after adjustment for performance status.</P>
<P>In addition, radiotherapy to the abdomen was not associated with improved survival, as we found in one trial that there was no difference in the risk of death and disease progression in women who received whole abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy, after adjustment for age and stage of disease. Previous studies have shown that doxorubicin, despite being established in the treatment of uterine carcinoma, does not seem to be highly active.</P>
<P>Adverse events were comprehensively reported for the comparisons of combination therapy and ifosfamide and whole body irradiation and chemotherapy. More women experienced side effects when they received combination therapy than ifosamide alone and chemotherapy than whole body irradiation. The effect of therapy on quality of life was not reported in any of the trials.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias.

<P>Three trials met the inclusion criteria and these randomised 579 women, of whom all were assessed at the end of the trials. Two trials assessing 373 participants with stage III to IV persistent or recurrent disease, found that women who received combination therapy had a significantly lower risk of death and disease progression than women who received single agent ifosfamide, after adjustment for performance status (HR = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60 to 0.94 and HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.90 for OS and PFS respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in all reported adverse events, with the exception of nausea and vomiting, where significantly more women experienced these ailments in the combination therapy group than the Ifosamide group (RR = 3.53, 95% CI: 1.33 to 9.37).</P>
<P>In one trial there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of death and disease progression in women who received whole body irradiation and chemotherapy, after adjustment for age and FIGO stage (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.05 and HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.18 for OS and PFS respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in all reported adverse events, with the exception of haematological and neuropathy morbidities, where significantly less women experienced these morbidities in the whole body irradiation group than the chemotherapy group (RR= 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.16) for haematological morbidity and all nine women in the trial experiencing neuropathy morbidity were in the chemotherapy group).</P>

<P>In advanced stage metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma as well as recurrent disease adjuvant combination, chemotherapy with ifosfamide should be considered. Combination chemotherapy with ifosfamide and paclitaxel is associated with lower risk of death compared with ifosfamide alone.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-20 10:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Uterine carcinosarcomas are uncommon accounting for 4.3% of all cancers of the uterine corpus in Western Populations (<LINK REF="REF-El-Nashar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Nashar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1981</LINK>). The worldwide annual incidence is between 0.5 and 3.3 cases per 100,000 women (<LINK REF="REF-Harlow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlow 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2004</LINK>). In the UK the incidence of sarcoma is quoted to be 1 per 100,000 women and of these, 87% are carcinosarcomas (<LINK REF="REF-Olah-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olah 1992</LINK>). Uterine carcinosarcomas, also called malignant mixed mesodermal tumours (MMT) or malignant mixed mullerian tumours (MMMT) are rare tumours with both malignant epithelial and malignant mesenchymal components. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) programme data also demonstrated that carcinosarcoma was the predominant uterine sarcoma (0.82/100,000) followed by leiomyosarcoma (0.64/100,000) and endometrial stromal sarcoma (0.19/100,000) (<LINK REF="REF-Harlow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlow 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uterine carcinosarcomas tend to be aggressive with poor prognosis in comparison to uterine adenocarcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Barwick-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barwick 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gadducci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadducci 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toyoshima-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Toyoshima 2004</LINK>). About 35% of carcinosarcomas are not confined to the uterus at diagnosis, and in most reports the median overall survival was about 21 months (<LINK REF="REF-Gadducci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadducci 2002</LINK>). The most important prognostic factor is the extent of the tumour at the time of diagnosis; the prognosis being very poor when the tumour has extended beyond the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Sartori-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sartori 1997</LINK>). There has been no significant improvement in survival suggested by some reports (<LINK REF="REF-Callister-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callister 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Carcinosarcomas can be subdivided histologically into homologous and heterologous types and it is important to differentiate the tumours that are monoclonal, that is those derived from a single stem cell, from true mixed cell tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Zelmanowicz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelmanowicz 1998</LINK>). This histological distinction (<LINK REF="REF-McCluggage-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCluggage 2002</LINK>) is significant as the natural history of true mixed carcinosarcomas appear to be more aggressive. There is convincing recent evidence that most cases of uterine carcinosarcoma are monoclonal in origin (<LINK REF="REF-Szukala-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szukala 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toyoshima-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Toyoshima 2004</LINK>). These data indicate that uterine carcinosarcoma may be metaplastic, with the implication that the sarcomatous components are derived from the carcinomatous elements (<LINK REF="REF-McCluggage-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCluggage 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Histological diagnosis and clinical staging (based on findings at surgery) usually follows primary treatment which is surgical. In a prospective multi-centre Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of carcinosarcomas 61 of the 301 patients (20%) with clinical Stage I and II disease were reassigned to pathological Stages III and IV on the basis of lymph node metastases. The study also revealed a recurrence rate of 53% for all carcinosarcomas, with 44% for homologous and 63% for heterologous tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Major-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Major 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-20 10:50:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>As with uterine adenocarcinomas, the mainstay of treatment is surgical removal of the tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Menczer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menczer 2005</LINK>), however, the high rates of both local and distant relapse after surgery suggests a need for effective adjuvant therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Galaal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galaal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>). The survival of patients with advanced uterine carcinosarcoma is poor with a pattern of failure indicating a higher likelihood of upper abdominal and distant metastatic recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Galaal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galaal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spanos-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanos 1986</LINK>). These patients are less likely to benefit from local adjuvant therapy and therefore consideration for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy as well as whole body irradiation has been considered in several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menczer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menczer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramondetta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ramondetta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1989</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-20 10:51:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Several chemotherapeutic agents have been examined as single agent therapy in uterine carcinosarcoma with response rates as follows: 16% to19% with adriamycin (<LINK REF="REF-Omura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omura 1983</LINK>), 32% to 36% with ifosfamide (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>), 19% with cisplatin (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 2004</LINK>), and 18% with paclitaxel (<LINK REF="STD-Curtin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Curtin 2001</LINK>). Doxorubicin, despite being established in the treatment of uterine carcinoma, does not seem to be highly active in uterine carcinosarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Omura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omura 1983</LINK>). Combination chemotherapeutic agents have been used in uterine carcinosarcoma with combination therapy appearing to be superior to single-agent treatment in terms of improvement in progression-free and overall survival. However, these combination therapies may be associated with increased toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Homesley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Homesley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijswijk-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijswijk 1994</LINK>). Whole abdominal irradiation has been investigated in a retrospective study on early staged uterine carcinosarcoma in the adjuvant setting. This study suggested that the addition of whole abdominal irradiation did not improve survival (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-20 10:52:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Carcinosarcoma is a disease with a high recurrence rate (40% to 60%), and a tendency to distant metastasis, therefore, an effective systemic therapy may improve the outcomes of this disease. Several chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to produce objective response rates in patients with advanced carcinosarcoma. In addition, whole abdominal irradiation has been used in the adjuvant setting (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramondetta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ramondetta 2003</LINK>). These treatment modalities may be associated with some costs in terms of toxicity and quality of life (QoL). Therefore, there is a need to assess the effectiveness and safety rigorously.</P>

<P>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were downloaded to the reference management database Endnote, duplicates were removed and the remaining references were independently examined by three review authors (KG, KG1, EH). These three review authors screened titles and abstracts of references identified from the search and eliminated articles that were obviously not relevant to the search question. When all authors determined that the trial was not eligible for inclusion no further action was taken. When any of the authors determined that the article may have been eligible for inclusion, the full text article was obtained. Each review author then independently determined if these trials were eligible for inclusion. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion. Further information was sought from the study authors when papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:24:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:23:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We found three trials, enrolling 579 women, that met our inclusion criteria. Two of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Homesley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Homesley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>) compared combination chemotherapy and ifosfamide alone, whereas the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfson 2007</LINK>), compared whole body irradiation and combination chemotherapy in women with uterine carcinosarcoma.</P>
<P>When we combined the findings from the two similar trials, adjusted for important prognostic factors, we found that the risk of death and disease progression was lower among women who received combination therapy than among women who received ifosfamide alone (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94 and HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90 for overall and progression-free survival respectively). Risk of adverse events was not significantly different for most outcomes but the rate of nausea and vomiting was higher in women who received combination therapy (RR = 3.53, 95% CI 1.33, 9.37).</P>
<P>The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfson 2007</LINK>) found no significant difference between whole abdominal irradiation and combination chemotherapy in terms of overall and progression-free survival, but did seem to suggest that in general whole body irradiation was associated with less morbidity than combination chemotherapy, where haematological and neuropathic morbidities were significantly lower in women who received whole body irradiation compared to those who received combination chemotherapy (RR= 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16 for haematological morbidity and all nine women in the trial experiencing neuropathy morbidity were in the chemotherapy group).</P>
<P>The trials had many strengths. They gave HRs that correctly allowed for censoring and they provided information about adverse events. Both trials recruited a satisfactory number of participants and a reasonably large number of events were observed in the two survival outcomes, but the number of women with adverse events was generally low so lacked statistical power to detect a difference.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:23:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>To date, two RCTs have compared the effect of ifosfamide with combination of ifosfamide and other chemotherapeutic agents. These trials suggested that combination chemotherapy may be better than single agent therapy in the treatment of advanced staged and recurrent uterine carcinosarcoma. The combination of ifosfamide and paclitaxel was associated with significant improvement in overall and progression-free survival. The evidence from a single RCT suggested no benefit of whole abdominal irradiation over combination chemotherapy.</P>
<P>We were unable to report on Quality-of-life (QoL) as none of the included trials had QoL assessments as a component of the trials. Treatment-related morbidity very often degrades the quality of the time that patients live, which is especially important after the completion of treatment for advanced cancer where patients have poor prognosis and will want to enjoy a comfortable standard of living during their final months.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:24:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The amount of available evidence does allow robust conclusions for the comparison of combination therapy and ifosfamide, as there is consistency and commonality in the results, but the comparison of whole body irradiation is restricted to single trial analyses.</P>
<P>The reporting of the methodological quality of the trials showed that two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Homesley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Homesley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfson 2007</LINK>) were at low risk of bias while the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK> was at high risk of bias as it only satisfied two of the criteria used to assess risk of bias.</P>
<P>All three trials reported a hazard ratio (HR), which is the best statistic to summarise the difference in risk in two treatment groups over the duration of a trial, when there is "censoring" i.e. the time to death (or disease progression) is unknown for some women as they were still alive (or disease-free) at the end of the trial.</P>
<P>The two similar trials (<LINK REF="STD-Homesley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Homesley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2000</LINK>) gave consistent evidence about all outcomes as individual trials were robust to the findings of the meta-analyses, although in some instances point estimates were not necessarily similar. For survival outcomes, there is evidence that combination therapy delays death and disease progression compared with single agent ifosfamide, but we are not sure how safe combination therapy is as there were relatively low numbers of adverse events and it was associated with significantly more grades three and four nausea and vomiting. A substantial number of women experienced disease progression and death, which helps to ensure high quality evidence.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:24:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature and all studies were sifted and data independently extracted by three review authors. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as we found only three included trials.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:24:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on the effects of adjuvant treatments for uterine carcinosarcoma. There are large number of trials other than RCTs studying adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents at present. These phase II trials, observational studies or non-controlled trials were limited by small numbers and methodological limitations. There are several non systematic reviews on uterine sarcomas and/or uterine carcinosarcoma mainly addressing clinicopathological and prognostic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Arrastia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrastia 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-01-19 15:19:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimum chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced uterine carcinosarcoma is still to be defined, although our review has provided evidence that combination chemotherapy improves survival. The combination of ifosfamide and paclitaxel was associated with significant improvement in overall and progression-free survival. While the addition of cisplatin to ifosfamide appears to offer a small improvement in progression-free survival over ifosfamide alone; the added toxicity may not justify the use of this combination.</P>
<P>In advanced stage metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma as well as recurrent disease, adjuvant combination chemotherapy with ifosfamide should be considered.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-20 11:25:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for a trial that randomly assigns women with advanced uterine carinosarcoma and no prior treatment to receive either ifosfamide and paclitaxel or platinum and paclitaxel.</P>
<P>In addition, we need a randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage uterine carcinosarcoma.</P>
<P>Future trials need to clarify which groups of patients would benefit from which treatment by stratifying patients at trial entry for prior therapies, performance status, site of disease and co-morbidity.</P>
<P>quality of life (QoL) and symptom scores should be assessed as well as primary outcomes such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).</P>
<P>We need to determine the best dose of combination chemotherapy with the least adverse effects in advanced uterine carcinosarcoma.</P>
<P>Further studies (phase II trial) should be set up to investigate the use of newer chemotherapeutic agents in uterine carcinosarcoma.</P>

<P>
<B>Arm 1</B>: Whole Abdominal Irradiation (WAI) was to be delivered by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the abdomen and pelvis that involved a minimum beam energy of 4 MV photons and utilised an anterior/posterior (AP) and posterior/anterior (PA) summated technique. The field borders for WAI involved 1 cm margins on the diaphragm superiorly, the inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the lateral aspect of the peritoneal margin laterally. At the outset of this protocol, the whole abdomen was treated to a total dose of 30 Gy at 1 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, and 5 days each week with a minimum of 6 h between morning and afternoon fractions (hyperfractionation). Due to slow patient accrual, in August of 1996, the dose fractionation schedule was changed to once-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy for 5 days each week to the same total dose to the whole abdomen of 30 Gy. Whole abdominal irradiation (WAI).<BR/>The true pelvis was treated with a boost requiring a four-field &#8220;box&#8221; set-up that included not only AP/PA beam portals but also opposed lateral fields. The pelvic field borders included the S1/S2 interspace superiorly, the mid-level portion of the obturator foramen inferiorly, and 1 cm beyond the widest aspect of the true pelvic laterally. At the initiation of this study, the true pelvis as a boost was treated to a total dose of 20 Gy at 1 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day for 5 days each week with the same 6 h time interval between fractions as was initially done for the WAI (cumulative true pelvic dose of 50 Gy). As stated above, the fractionation schedule was also changed in August of 1996 for this portion of radiotherapy to once-daily fractions of 1.8 Gy for 5 days each week to a total dose of 19.8 Gy (cumulative true pelvic dose of 49.8 Gy).</P>
<P>
<B>Arm 2</B>: Cispltain, Ifosfamide with mesna (CIM) comprised intravenous (IV) cisplatin (20 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day × 4 days) that was to be followed by a 1 h IV administration of ifosfamide (1.5g/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day IV × 4 days) with mesna (120 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> IV bolus over 15 min on day one, followed by 1.5 g/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day IV continuous infusion × 4 days beginning with day one) every 3 weeks for three cycles. It was recommended that hydration be maintained by IV administration of 1 L over several hours preferably with either normal or one-half normal saline prior to initiation of chemotherapy in order to maintain urine output of at least 100 mL/h. IV fluid and electrolyte repletion was permitted as medically indicated during the 4-day course of chemotherapy.<BR/>Cisplatin administration was required prior to ifosfamide therapy and was to be reconstituted at a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL and infused at a rate of 1 mg/min. Dose modifications for toxicities of cisplatin and ifosfamide were permitted but not for mesna administration.</P>
<P>Protocol therapy was to be started within 8 weeks following initial surgery.</P>
