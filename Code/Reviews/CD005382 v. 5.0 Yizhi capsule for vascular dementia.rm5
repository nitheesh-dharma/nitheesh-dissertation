<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Vascular dementia (VD) is a syndrome or diagnosis that has different causes and clinical manifestations relating to several different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain. It influences a patient's quality of life seriously. 'Yizhi capsule' is believed to be effective in the treatment of vascular dementia for improving cognitive function. The review authors found no randomised placebo controlled trials that considered 'Yizhi capsule' for patients with vascular dementia. High quality, placebo controlled research is needed.</P>

<P>Vascular dementia (VD) is a syndrome or diagnosis that has different causes and clinical manifestations relating to several different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain. Some traditional Chinese herbal medicines were developed for treating VD. Yizhi capsule is one such herbal concoction which is reported to improve clinical symptoms significantly. The efficacy and adverse effects of Yizhi capsule need to be reviewed systematically and assessed critically to inform clinical practice and guide the continued search for new treatment regimens.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CONAHL, LILACS, clinical trial registries and grey literature sources were searched on 8 January 2009 using the terms yi-zhi, "yi zhi" and yizhi. In addition the review authors searched a variety of Chinese databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised, placebo controlled trials in which patients with vascular dementia were treated with 'Yizhi capsule' were included.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. We identified nine references to trials which included the term 'Yizhi capsule' in the description of the interventions. Two study authors were contacted by telephone and we discovered that the allocation methods they had used were not actually randomised. Four references were describing the same study. Three studies were excluded because 'positive drugs' were used as a control.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-13 12:13:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Vascular dementia (VD) is a group of syndromes and has different causes and clinical manifestations relating to several different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain.</P>
<P>The DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of VD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) are as follows:<BR/>A. The development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment and one or more cognitive disturbances including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and disturbance in executive functioning.<BR/>B. The cognitive deficits in criteria A each cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning.<BR/>C. Focal neurological signs and symptoms or laboratory evidence indicative of cerebrovascular diseases that are judged to be aetiologically related to the disturbance.<BR/>D. The deficits do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</P>
<P>Vascular dementia is due ischaemic damage to the brain due to impaired blood supply to the brain, and can be divided into different types depending on the nature of the vascular disease as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Arteriosclerotic dementia</LI>
<LI>Vascular dementia (following a stroke or other rare causes and involving both cortical and subcortical damage to the brain)</LI>
<LI>Multi-infarct dementia (MID)</LI>
<LI>Subcortical vascular dementia (Binswanger's disease)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The morbidity of dementia including VD increases relatively with age according to a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Jorm-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 1998</LINK>). There are regional differences in the incidence of different types of dementia. In Western societies, VD is the second leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, the prevalence of VD increases linearly with age and varies greatly from country to country, ranging from 1.2 to 4.2% of people over 65 years old, even after adjustment for age and sex, and it accounts for approximately 20% of all cases of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1995</LINK>). In some parts of Asia and developing countries there is little difference from the western countries in the prevalence rate of dementia, but VD is the most common form. In China, its prevalence among people aged over 60 years is 0.47% and it accounts for about 37% of all cases of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2003</LINK>); while the data in Japan are respectively 2.2% and nearly 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Ikeda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikeda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takehiko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takehiko 2002</LINK>). There are some correlations between stroke and the prevalence rate of dementia. Nearly 31.8% of patients develop new-onset dementia during the year following a stroke; frequency of stroke-related dementia (excluding mixed Alzheimer's disease plus vascular dementia) is 28.4%, and that of dementia after first-ever stroke is 28.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Pohjasvaara-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohjasvaara 1998a</LINK>). VD has been found to be associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in people with dementia who have had a stroke. Patients with VD alone have a higher rate of 5-year survival than those with coexistence of other atherosclerotic disease (75% versus 39%) (<LINK REF="REF-Kannayiram-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannayiram 2004</LINK>). The complications of dementia are a common cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors for VD include hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, smoking, age, high white matter grade, number of MRI infarcts, ventricular size, and history of stroke, all of which are involved in cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kuller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravaglia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1998</LINK>). As stroke is a major determinant of VD, it is reasonable to expect that risk factors for stroke would also increase the risk of VD. Hypertension is an important risk factor, followed by diabetes. While hypertension increases the risk of VD, high systolic blood pressure may serve a protective role once dementia has set in (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1993</LINK>). In one study, although subjects with VD were more likely to have been hypertensive in the past, they currently had lower blood pressure values and more orthostatic hypotension than stroke patients without dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Pohjasvaara-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohjasvaara 1998b</LINK>). One study showed that high total fat intake was associated with an increased risk of VD, whereas fish consumption was inversely related to dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Kalmijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalmijn 1997</LINK>). Other factors associated with VD are sex, age, or education. According to some studies, men (especially men aged less than 75 years) are at a higher risk of VD than women (<LINK REF="REF-Aevarsson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aevarsson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1994</LINK>). Poor education is an independent risk factor for AD but not VD, and the incidence of dementia increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Ravaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravaglia 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The principles of treatment are to prevent further worsening of VD by modifying associated risk factors. Possible specific therapies include drug treatment which is primarily used to treat underlying disease such as hypertension. Treatment of hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg is universally applied, and there is evidence that treatment of those with diastolic BP of 90 to 110 mmHg and systolic BP greater than 160 mmHg is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1996</LINK>). Antiplatelet agents, for example aspirin, may also slow the progression of VD and although there is no evidence for aspirin's efficacy, it is commonly prescribed for the treatment and secondary prevention of VD (<LINK REF="REF-Rands-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rands 2008</LINK>). As assessed by comprehensive ratings, clinical global ratings and combined cognitive measures, a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1994</LINK>) has shown that hydergine is effective for VD. However, a Cochrane review concluded that Hydergine's efficacy in dementia remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Olin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olin 2000</LINK>). Treatment with pentoxifylline was also found to be beneficial for patients with multiinfarct dementia through a double blind, placebo-controlled, Multicentre study (EDS 1996). Neuroprotective drugs such as nimodipine, propentofylline, and posatirelin are currently under study and may be effective. All of these current approaches for the treatment of VD focus on both the mobilization of remaining cognitive and functional capacities and the prevention of further disease progression. Otherwise, the control of risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes may also have a stabilising effect, although evidence is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 1993</LINK>). The general management of dementia includes appropriate referral to community services, judgment and decision-making regarding legal and ethical issues (e.g., driving, competency, advance directives), and consideration of caregiver stress (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some physicians believe that Chinese herbs could be effective in the treatment of VD (e.g., <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ou-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2004</LINK>). Chinese herbal medicine is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which is a complete system of healing that developed in China about 3000 years ago combining the use of medicinal herbs, acupuncture, food therapy, massage, and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and prevention of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fulder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulder 1996</LINK>). It is based on the idea that laws of nature can be used to understand the inner workings of the body and has unique theories in both diagnosis and treatment. For VD, TCM drug treatment, which consists typically of complex prescriptions of a combination of several components, is based on: "nourishing kidney", "promoting blood circulation", "dissipating phlegm" and "resuscitation".</P>
<P>Yizhi capsule has a fixed composition. The components are: Radix Polygoni Multiflori 14 g; Radix Ginseng 4 g; Rhizoma Acori Graminei 8 g; Radix Polygalae 6 g; Hirudo 10 g; Herba Epimedii 10 g; Rhizoma Anemarrhenae 6 g; Rhizoma ChuanXiong 12 g. Every capsule contains the mixture of the components at a combined weight of 0.225 g. The effects associated with individual components are as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Radix Polygoni Multiflori and Radix Ginseng are used to slow senescence, reduce blood cholesterol and heart rate; they reportedly can also have an anti-atherosclerotic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Rhizoma Acori Graminei and Radix Polygalae have been used as sedatives and anticonvulsants. They also reportedly can improve the abilities of study and memory (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Hirudo, Herba Epimedii and Rhizoma Anemarrhenae have been reported to reduce blood cholesterol, be anti-atherosclerotic and inhibit the formation, presence or development of a thrombus (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Rhizoma ChuanXiong has been reported to reduce blood pressure and cerebrovascular resistance, increase blood supply to the brain, and act as an anticoagulant that can inhibit the activation of platelets and reduce whole blood viscosity. In addition, it may also act as a sedative (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Yizhi capsule is reported to improve clinical symptoms significantly, but there is no compelling evidence of its efficacy for improving cerebral function. The efficacy and adverse effects of Yizhi capsule need to be reviewed systematically and assessed critically to inform clinical practice and guide the continued search for new treatment regimens. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yizhi capsule for the treatment of VD.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (QP, TX) independently selected trials for relevance and against defined inclusion criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviewers of Interventions 4.2.5. Trials that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Reviewers' selection of trials were compared and the final list of studies was reached by consensus. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Sources of bias were considered on a study-by-study basis and studies were excluded if two reviewers (QP, TX) agreed that bias was significant. In those cases, exclusions were specified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data, should any included studies be found, will be extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline are not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point will be extracted if available.</P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest will be sought.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data will be sought on every patient randomized. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data will be sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data are not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial will be sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization will be eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>Data from titration phases prior to the randomized phase will not be used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomized, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rating scales</HEADING>
<P>A significant number of rating scales are used to assess outcomes within Mental Health. Scales vary in quality and many are poorly validated. Outcomes measured using unpublished rating scales or scales with no established reliability or validity were excluded from the review.</P>
<P>Individual patient data will be sought for all included studies when the published data are inadequate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of ordered categories (more than ten) the data will be treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) will be required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. For crossover trials only the data from the first treatment period will be used.</P>
<P>When changes from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics will be calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time will be assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome will be the weighted mean difference (WMD) when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference (SMD), which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation, when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the range is considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis it will be divided into smaller time periods and a separate meta-analysis conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been performed.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio will be used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials will be calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference will be presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model will be presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi squared statistic or the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic will performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results will be pooled, or a random-effects model will be used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where relevant, and data are available, subgroup analysis will include age, sex, type and severity of impairment, duration of treatment and individual cholinesterase inhibitors.<BR/>

<P>The CDCIG search in the Specialised register found five possibly relevant references; one turned out to be irrelevant and four were excluded. Sixty-two articles were retrieved by searches in Chinese databases. After screening nine studies possibly fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Of these nine studies, four were different publications of the same study <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> (Ji 2004a; Ji 2004b; Ji 2004c; Zhang 2005). Two studies were not real RCTs - we ascertained by telephone interview that the participants were allocated into two groups based on doctor's opinion or patient's preference - and were thus excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK>). We also interviewed the original authors of the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) for the randomisation procedure and other information, and they were identified as true randomised controlled trials. However, we were forced to exclude the remaining three studies because <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2001</LINK> used Hydergine and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> used Naofukang as the comparator. The update search of January 2009 found no studies. Thus no studies were included in this review. We extracted data from these three excluded studies in additional tables which summarize the confounded studies and explored their possible effects in following sections. Study <LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2004</LINK> was excluded due to the outcomes which did not meet our inclusion criteria because only blood lipids were tested.</P>
<P>No studies were included for analysis.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the three studies which used 'positive drugs' as a control can be seen in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-13 12:20:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There are several limitations in the trials of Yizhi capsule treating dementia:<BR/>1. Yizhi capsule is not yet a standardized, industrialised product. Physicians prepare their formulations based on the TCM theory and personal experience, and name their formulations 'Yizhi'. The term 'Yizhi' means benefit to intelligence, so, quite different formulations thought to benefit intelligence have been given a similar name. This situation resulted in difficulties in<U> </U>isolating which 'Yizhi' was the proper 'Yizhi' formulation for the review. We considered the study <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK> which was the first published paper using the term 'Yizhi', and other two studies <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2001</LINK> whose formulations were similar as <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK>, as the target 'Yizhi capsule' of this review.</P>
<P>2. All the trials discussed used self-prepared formulations. So the conflict of interest of authors should be considered in the evaluating the validity of results.</P>
<P>3. Some trials used drugs of uncertain efficacy as a control. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2001</LINK>) used hydergine and one (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) used Naofukang as control. A Cochrane review concluded that Hydergine's efficacy in dementia remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Olin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olin 2000</LINK>) and there is no current evidence of efficacy of Naofukang for dementia.</P>
<P>4. None of the trials used blinding for outcome detect person. This may result in detect bias.</P>
<P>5. Only one study with small sample size tested one formulation.</P>
<P>We present the main results of three thought of 'Yizhi capsule' trials here:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1997</LINK> showed a statistically significant difference in cognitive function on mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (WMD 2.80, 95%CI 0.05 to 5.55) between 'Yizhi capsule' and hydergine, and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) showed no difference in mood (WMD3.50, 95%CI -0.44 to 7.44); 'Yizhi capsule' also showed better effects on visuospatial function, memory and calculation functions than hydergine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> showed statistically significant differences on verbal intelligence quotients (VIQ) (WMD 10.22 95%CI 0.72 to 19.72), performance intelligence quotients (PIQ) (WMD 15.10 95%CI 6.72 to 23.48), full-scale intelligence quotients (FIQ) WMD 20.72 (95%CI 12.62 to 28.82), and total effective rate (RR 1.60 95%CI 1.18 to 2.17). These indicate that 'Yizhi capsule' is more effective than 'Naofukang capsule'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2001</LINK> showed no statistically significant difference between 'Tongmai Yizhi capsule' and Hydergine on MMSE (WMD 1.30, 95%CI-0.40 to 3.00) and BBS (<I>Peer: authors should state the full name of the test as well) </I>(WMD 0.60, 95%CI -1.68 to 2.88), but a statistically significant difference on HDS (WMD 1.50, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.31). There was no significant difference on the total rate of improvement (RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.55). Performance on all outcomes was considered to have undergone significant improvement from baseline.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-13 12:21:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-01-13 12:20:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials for or against 'Yizhi capsule' as a treatment for vascular dementia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-13 12:21:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>A placebo control needs to be used in further research on 'Yizhi capsule' for vascular dementia. In future randomized controlled trials evaluators should be blinded and the allocation sequence should be generated by a statistician or another person who does not attend the study.</P>
<P>Outcome measures and evaluation methods of traditional Chinese medicine should be defined clearly and in detail. The neuropsychological function should be the outcome measure rather than intelligence quotients.</P>
<P>Although Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for dementia and its method of manufacture are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacological preparations used in trials cannot be clearly specified. This is in marked contrast to pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, their quantities, and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known; and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of treatments are inevitable consequences of traditional Chinese medicines, though the Chinese Government also specifies what are acceptable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results.</P>
<P>Furthermore, one must accept that the overall treatment concept for traditional Chinese medicine is different to that used in Western medicine. When a study uses a self-prepared herbal formulation, the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail, in order to achieve consistent effects.</P>

<P>Parallel design;<BR/>"Random allocation" was mentioned in the paper but there was a lack of description about the randomisation procedure. We telephoned the original author, ascertaining that the random number table was used to generate the random sequence.<BR/>Single blind on giving medications. Allocation was performed by authors, so, the concealment was judged as 'not used'.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In total 61 inpatients and outpatients. 32 in the treatment group, M/F=27/5, aged from 46 to 74 years, mean age 64.32  5.42 years.<BR/>29 in the control group, M/F=21/8, aged from 46 to 73 years, mean age 63.216.41 years);<BR/>The patients are diagnosed with vascular dementia by acceptable criteria such as DSM IV, ICD-10. Cognition and mood are tested by using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hamilton Depression Scale(HDS). Differential diagnosis between vascular dementia and AD is made by Hachinski Ischaemic score (HIS), all in line with The Golden Rule for Clinical Research of New Traditional Chinese Drug. The age of subjects should be more than 45 years.<BR/>Withdrawal/drop-out: not stated.<BR/>Characteristics of patients at baseline: similar.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>'Yizhi' capsule for the treatment group: 2.0g t.i.d P.O. for 2 months;<BR/>Hydergine for the control group: 2mg t.i.d P.O. for 2 months.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>1. According to the Golden Rule for Clinical Research of New Traditional Chinese Drug, the treatment effect is clinically classified into controlled, markedly effective, improved and unresponsive groups, and MMSE is considered as the main referential index, combined with the Activities of Daily living-Scale (ADL) and improvement of symptoms to evaluate the treatment effects;<BR/>2. Improvement of traditional Chinese medical signs;<BR/>3. Improvement of neurologic deficits;<BR/>4. Recovery of capacity to lead daily life;<BR/>5. Improvement of balance and gait;<BR/>6. Improvement of brain topographic mappings;<BR/>7. Improvement of blood rheology indexes;<BR/>8. Adverse effects.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>1. The formulation of 'Yizhi capsule' was prepared by authors themselves;<BR/>2. The Yizhi capsule was made by the authors' hospital;<BR/>3. We cannot publish information about the exact amount of each element from the original author in order to protect their business interests;<BR/>4. Allocation for patients was performed by authors themselves.</P>

<P>Parallel design;<BR/>Randomisation procedure was reported because a random number table was used to generate allocation sequence.<BR/>Double blind. The patients' numbers were revealed with the medications at the end of analysis, thus the 'allocation concealment' was judged as 'adequate'</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Trial was conducted in Department of Special Health of the Affiliated Hospital and Cerebrovascular Disease Institute of Medical College, Qingdao University.<BR/>In total 94 patients, 51 males and 43 females, aged 45-79 years, who were diagnosed with multi-infarct dementia. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. The patients were divided randomly into 'yizhi' capsule group (47 cases) and control group (47 cases). All the cases were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of Chinese Classification and diagnostic criteria of Mental Disorders-2-Revised (CCMD-2-R).<BR/>Inclusion criteria: 1. The evidence of multi-infarct dementia diagnosed from history, physical examination (including nervous system examination), laboratory tests and additional examinations; and the development and course of mental disorder is related to multi-infarct dementia. 2. Torpor is the main manifestation. 3. Hypophrenia in different degree, which often influences the adaptability to society. 4. The course is at least 3 months. 5. The patient takes the trial voluntarily.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: 1. The age is below 18 or above 80. 2. Complicated by severe primary diseases in cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and haematopoietic systems or other mental diseases. 3. The patient does not willingly take part in the trial.<BR/>There were 12 drop outs because they did not take the treatment properly during the trial, so 82 cases entered into the result analysis;<BR/>Characteristics of patients at baseline were similar.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>6 Yizhi' capsules t.i.d. P.O;<BR/>Control group: Piracetam 0.9 g t.i.d. P.O.<BR/>The course for both groups was 3 months.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The effect was estimated by using judgements of effectiveness criteria in the guiding principles of clinical research on treatment of dementia with traditional Chinese new drugs, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) was used for assay of intelligence, including 2 parts of linguistic scale and operation scale. This made altogether 11 tests.<BR/>1. The effects for patients of 2 groups: In the 'yizhi' capsule group 21 cases had marked effectiveness, 14 cases had effectiveness, 7 cases were unresponsive. So the total effectiveness rating was 83%(35/42); in the control group 7 cases had marked effectiveness, 15 cases had effectiveness, 18 cases were unresponsive. So the total effectiveness rating was 55%(22/40).<BR/>2. The linguistic intelligence quotient, operation intelligence quotient, and total intelligence quotient of patients in the two groups.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>1. The formulation of 'Yizhi capsule' was prepared by the authors;<BR/>2. The Yizhi capsule was prepared by a cooperate institute, the Center of Shandong Analysis and Measurement, so this was not an industrialised product;<BR/>3. No detection blinding.</P>
