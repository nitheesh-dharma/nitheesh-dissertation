<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 09:43:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sick preterm infants are easily affected by reduced oxygen levels, cold and poor blood circulation. Their blood becomes acid with a build up of lactic acid (metabolic acidosis) that their kidneys cannot correct. Metabolic acidosis in preterm infants may cause bleeding in the brain (intra or periventricular haemorrhage) and problems with longer-term neurodevelopment (including hearing, vision and cognitive ability). Solutions of the alkaline sodium bicarbonate or tris-(hydroxymethyl) amino methane (THAM) can be given to correct the acidity. These solutions are more concentrated than blood (hyperosmolar), which can change blood flow and cause bleeding in the brain, especially when given rapidly or in large quantities. The rationale for their use is to prevent the adverse outcomes that are associated with acidosis in preterm infants.<BR/>The review authors searched the medical literature and found two small randomised controlled trials (98 infants) measuring/investigating the benefit of either infusion of base or of a fluid injection (bolus) in the treatment of preterm infants with metabolic acidosis. Infants were given an infusion of sodium bicarbonate on the first day of postnatal life, compared with no treatment or a fluid bolus with albumin. There was no clear evidence that the base infusion corrected metabolic acidosis more effectively. One of the studies (62 newborns) reported no difference in early deaths at one week or in the incidence of bleeding in the brain. Neither study assessed longer-term neurological disabilities.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Metabolic acidosis in the early newborn period is associated with adverse outcomes in preterm infants.

<P>We found two small randomised controlled trails that fulfilled the eligibility criteria (<A HREF="Corbet 1977">Corbet 1977</A>; <A HREF="Dixon 1999">Dixon 1999</A>) and one unpublished pilot trial (<A HREF="Lawn 2005">Lawn 2005</A>). <A HREF="Corbet 1977">Corbet 1977</A> compared treating infants with sodium bicarbonate infusion (N = 30) versus no treatment (N = 32) and did not find evidence of an effect on mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.39 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 2.67)] or in the incidence of intra/periventricular haemorrhage [RR 1.24 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 3.28)]. Addition of the unpublished data of <A HREF="Lawn 2005">Lawn 2005</A> does not change the overall estimate of effect on mortality [typical RR 1.45 (95%CI 0.82 to 2.56)]. <A HREF="Dixon 1999">Dixon 1999</A> compared treatment with sodium bicarbonate (N = 16) versus fluid bolus (N = 20). The primary outcome assessed was arterial blood pH/base excess two hours after the intervention. Other clinical outcomes were not reported. Neither trial assessed longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether infusion of base or fluid bolus reduces morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with metabolic acidosis. Further large randomised trials are needed. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-05 09:47:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-22 09:42:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sick preterm infants are susceptible to hypoxia, cold stress, and/or hypoperfusion resulting in accumulation of non-carbonic acids in the blood. The co-existence of immature renal function with inadequate hydrogen ion excretion and a low bicarbonate reabsorption threshold makes these infants particularly susceptible to the development of metabolic acidosis. Neonatal intensive care aims to optimise organ perfusion and oxygenation by treating underlying conditions such as infection or hypovolaemia, and by maintaining key parameters, including acid-base balance, in a physiological range.</P>
<P>Metabolic acidosis in preterm infants has been associated with the development of periventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Moriette-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moriette 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levene-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1982</LINK>; Cooke 1997), periventricular leukomalacia (<LINK REF="REF-Low-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 1990</LINK>), and poor longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes in very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aylward-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aylward 1993</LINK>). An inverse relationship between the degree of acidosis at birth and cognitive abilities assessed between four and seven years of age has been demonstrated in term and preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1999</LINK>). The development of intraventricular haemorrhage has been associated with fluctuations in cerebral arterial blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1983</LINK>). Cerebral vascular resistance is decreased in term infants with metabolic acidosis in the first week of life (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>) and low arterial pH has been associated with increased cerebral artery blood flow velocity in very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of metabolic acidosis in preterm infants has not been clearly established. A normal arterial blood pH in the term infant has been defined as pH 7.27 to 7.43 at up to 24 hours post birth and 7.32 to 7.42 at seven days of age (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1968</LINK>). In normal pregnancies fetal pH does not change with gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Soothill-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soothill 1986</LINK>). Normal arterial base excess in the first 28 days of life has been defined as - 5 to + 5 mmol/litre in the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1999</LINK>). The Joint Working Group of the British Association of Perinatal Medicine recommended maintaining an arterial pH above 7.25 as below this pH various physiological and cellular functions are compromised (<LINK REF="REF-BAPM-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPM 1992</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 09:47:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A postal survey of British neonatologists found that most used fluid boluses (4.5% human albumin, fresh frozen plasma, blood, normal saline) or base (sodium bicarbonate and Tris-(Hydroxymethyl) Amino Methane (THAM)) infusions to correct metabolic acidosis in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1994</LINK>). However, the use of any type of additional fluid in the preterm infant must be considered carefully. Systematic review of the use of albumin in resuscitation of critically ill patients of all age groups demonstrated statistically significantly increased mortality rates for those receiving albumin compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2001</LINK>). A systematic review of restricted versus liberal water intake in preterm infants showed restricted water intake reduced the risk of patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis and death and a trend toward reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both sodium bicarbonate (4.2% or 2.1%) and THAM are hyperosmolar. Sodium bicarbonate may cause hypernatraemia and has been associated with intraventricular haemorrhage when given rapidly and in large quantities (<LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1974</LINK>). There are also concerns that intravenous infusion of base can cause a transient paradoxical worsening of intracellular acidosis, loss of cerebral vascular autoregulation, decreased cerebral blood flow and acute changes in cerebrospinal fluid pH (<LINK REF="REF-Lou-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lou 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lou-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lou 1979</LINK>). Observational data have suggested that treatment with sodium bicarbonate on the first day of life is associated with a higher incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage in very preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Synnes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Synnes 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included two published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Corbet-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Corbet 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 1999</LINK>). In addition, unpublished data from the pilot trial of Lawn and coworkers (<LINK REF="STD-Lawn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawn 2005</LINK>) are included in this review. Details are presented in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>INCLUDED STUDIES:</P>
<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Corbet-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Corbet 1977</LINK> randomly allocated newborn preterm infants within the first few hours after birth to receive either "liberal" sodium bicarbonate infusions (N = 30) or "conservative" bicarbonate infusions (N = 32) given with their standard maintenance intravascular infusions of 10% glucose. Those infants in the "liberal" group were allocated to receive sodium bicarbonate at doses of 5 to 15 mmol /decilitre of 10% glucose, titrated on the degree of acidosis. The bicarbonate infusion was continued until the infant's arterial blood pH reached 7.30. These infants received an average of 3.6 mmol/kilogram of sodium bicarbonate in first 24 hours of postnatal life. The infants in the "conservative" group did not have any sodium bicarbonate added to their maintenance glucose infusions.</P>
<P>This trial did not strictly fulfil our a priori inclusion criteria since biochemically confirmed acidosis was not per se an eligibility criterion for participation in the trial. The investigators recruited infants thought to be at "high-risk" of acidosis (birth weight less than 1500 grams, or birth weight less than 2000 grams and infant needing mechanical ventilation, or Apgar score less than four at one minute, or infant with a clinical diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease). However, we made a consensus decision to include the trial because there was post hoc evidence that most participating infants fulfilled our review criterion for acidosis: All of the participating infants were acidotic (pH less than 7.30) at enrolment and most had arterial blood pH values less than 7.25. The mean arterial blood pH of participating infants was 7.16 at trial entry. Participating infants were followed up until the end of the first week of postnatal life. The primary outcomes assessed were time to correction of acidosis, mortality in the first week of postnatal life, and incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 1999</LINK> randomly allocated 36 normotensive newborn infants with metabolic acidosis (defined as a simultaneous arterial blood pH less than 7.25 and base excess worse than -6 mmol/litre) to receive an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes of either 10 millilitres per kilogram of 4.5% albumin infusion (N = 20) or 4.2% sodium bicarbonate (N = 16): dose in millimoles calculated as one-sixth of product of weight (kilograms) and base excess (mmol/litre). Most of the participating infants were preterm. Thirty-three of the 36 infants were born before 36 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome assessed was arterial blood pH and base excess two hours after the intervention. Other clinical outcomes were not reported.</P>
<P>3. <LINK REF="STD-Lawn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawn 2005</LINK> conducted a pilot trial of a continuous weak intra-arterial infusion of sodium bicarbonate. The pilot study enrolled 20 infants born at the Royal Sussex County Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital, London weighing less than 1000 g with a gestational age less than 32 weeks. The study aimed to reduce the number of bolus treatments with bicarbonate or fluid to treat metabolic acidosis by giving a continuous weak infusion of sodium bicarbonate intra-arterially. The primary outcome measure was the number of bolus bicarbonate or fluid treatments required by both groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Infants were randomised by serial sealed envelopes into treatment and control groups. Treatment groups received continuous heparinised sodium bicarbonate infusion into the umbilical artery catheter (UAC) or peripheral arterial line for 96 hrs starting within 12 hrs of birth; infants in the control group received standard heparinised half normal saline solution into the arterial line.  <BR/>
<BR/>Treatment of metabolic acidosis was according to neonatal intensive care unit protocol and was the same in both groups. Records were kept of the number, type and amount of fluid boluses given and the indication for their use as well as of the number and amount of bicarbonate boluses given for the duration of the study (96 hours after intra-arterial infusion is commenced).</P>
<P>All infants had arterial blood pressure monitoring and hourly blood pressure heart rate and oxygen requirement noted for 96 hours. Minimum six hourly arterial blood gases were to be measured for the first 48 hours and then at least 12 hourly for the next 48 hours as was standard practice.  Blood volume losses were recorded in both groups. Both groups had twelve hourly urea and electrolyte estimations for the first 48 hours and 24 hourly for the next 48 hours, which was standard unit practice for babies under 1000g in the first 96 hours of life. Cranial ultrasound scans were be performed on control and treatment groups on days one, two and seven of life. Doppler ultrasound measurement of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity will be made during the first 24 hours of life and on the second day of life in both study groups when the baby was clinically stable.</P>
<P>The median gestational age was 26 + 6  weeks for control infants (range 24 + 3 to 29 + 0 weeks ) and 25 + 4 weeks for treated infants (range 24 + 1 to 28 + 5 weeks).      </P>
<P>This was a pilot study for a planned study of 160 infants; the larger trial was not conducted.</P>

<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK> randomly allocated 20 low birth weight infants with evidence of hypoxia and/or acidaemia to receive either a "slow" or a "rapid" infusion of sodium bicarbonate. This trial was not eligible for inclusion in this review as there was not a comparison group who did not receive any base or who received fluid bolus.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Bland-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bland 1976</LINK> randomly allocated 51 hypoproteinaemic preterm infants "at risk of developing acidaemia" to receive either an infusion of sodium bicarbonate over 5 to 10 minutes or an infusion of glucose or albumin within the first two hours after birth. This study was excluded because most of the participating infants were not acidotic at trial entry.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 09:52:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although both interventions have been long-established in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1994</LINK>), the available data do not provide evidence of benefit for either infusion of base or of a fluid bolus in the treatment of preterm infants with metabolic acidosis. Both trials included in this review assessed short term outcomes only (mainly correction of acidosis) and neither study assessed longer term neurological morbidity.</P>
<P>The rationale for the use of an infusion of base is that correction of metabolic acidosis will prevent the adverse outcomes that are associated with acidosis in preterm infants. In fact, the trial that compared treatment with sodium bicarbonate infusion versus no treatment did not find a statistically significant difference in the rate of resolution of metabolic acidosis (<LINK REF="STD-Corbet-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Corbet 1977</LINK>). However, this may be due to the very slow rate of infusion of sodium bicarbonate in the intervention group. Infants received 3.6 millimoles per kilogram over the first 24 hours of postnatal life. The trial did not find a statistically significant effect on early neonatal mortality, but included only 62 infants and was underpowered to detect an small but clinically important effect. Given the lack of robust evidence of benefit (and theoretical potential for harm), it has been argued that treating preterm infants with metabolic acidosis with infusions of base should be regarded as experimental and should not be undertaken out with the context of a randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ammari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammari 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similar concerns about the lack of evidence of benefit and potential for harm have been raised about the use of infusion of a fluid bolus in treating preterm infants with metabolic acidosis or other evidence of systemic underperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Hope-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1998</LINK>). There is some biological plausibility that a fluid bolus may improve organ perfusion in infants with hypovolaemia. However, in the absence of a clear precipitating event such as haemorrhage, hypovolaemia is probably a rare cause of metabolic acidosis in preterm infants. Because systemic underperfusion and hypovolaemia are very difficult to assess clinically, many infants may receive treatment with a fluid bolus inappropriately. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence that routine early volume expansion with blood products or crystalloid solutions prevents morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004</LINK>). In this review, we did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of treatment with fluid bolus versus no treatment in preterm infants with metabolic acidosis. <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 1999</LINK> compared base infusion with fluid bolus and found some evidence (of borderline clinical significance) that base infusion corrected metabolic acidosis more effectively than fluid bolus. This trial specifically excluded infants with evidence of hypotension from participating.</P>

<P>Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine if treating preterm infants with metabolic acidosis with either base or fluid bolus infusion prevents morbidity and mortality. Randomised trials may also examine the effects of these interventions in treating preterm infants with different degrees of metabolic acidosis (lower pH thresholds for intervention), analogous to recent studies that have attempted to determine the optimal target range for maintaining blood oxygen levels in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Askie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Askie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Askie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Askie 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Records were kept of the number, type and amount of fluid boluses given and the indication for their use as well as of the number and amount of bicarbonate boluses given for the duration of the study (96 hours after intra-arterial infusion is commenced).</P>
<P>All infants had arterial blood pressure monitoring and hourly blood pressure heart rate and oxygen requirement noted for 96 hours. Minimum 6 hourly arterial blood gases were be measured for the first 48 hours and then at least 12 hourly for the next 48 hours as was standard practice.  Blood volume losses were recorded in both groups. Both groups had twelve hourly urea and electrolyte estimations for the first 48 hours and 24 hourly for the next 48 hours, which was standard unit practice for babies under 1000g in the first 96 hours of life. Cranial ultrasound scans were be performed on control and treatment groups on days 1,2 and 7 of life. Doppler ultrasound measurement of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity will be made during the first 24 hours of life and on the second day of life in both study groups when the baby was clinically stable.</P>
