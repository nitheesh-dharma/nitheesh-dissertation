<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors evaluated which is the most effective and safe surgery for hysterectomy in women with benign gynaecological disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Hysterectomy for benign gynaecological disease, mostly abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse or uterine fibroids, is one of the most frequent gynaecological procedures (30% of women by the age of 60; 590,000 procedures annually in the USA). It can be performed through several approaches. Abdominal hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen. Vaginal hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus via the vagina, without an abdominal incision. Laparoscopic hysterectomy involves 'keyhole surgery' through small incisions in the abdomen. The uterus may be removed vaginally or, after morcellation (cutting it up), through one of the small incisions. There are various types of laparoscopic hysterectomy, depending on the extent of the surgery performed laparoscopically compared to that performed vaginally. More recently, laparoscopic hysterectomy has been performed robotically. In robotic surgery, the operation is done by a robot, while the (human) surgeon steers the robot from a chair in the corner of the operating room. It is important to be well informed about the relative benefits and harms of each approach to make best informed choices for each woman needing hysterectomy for a benign disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We analysed 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A RCT is a type of study in which the people being studied are randomly allocated one or other of the different treatments being investigated. This type of study is usually the best way to evaluate whether a treatment is truly effective, i.e. truly helps the patient. A systematic review systematically summarises the available RCTs on a subject.</P>
<P>A total of 5102 women participated. Comparisons were vaginal versus abdominal hysterectomy (nine trials, 762 women), laparoscopic versus abdominal hysterectomy (25 trials, 2983 women), laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy (16 trials, 1440 women) and laparoscopic versus robot-assisted hysterectomy (two trials, 152 women); in addition there were studies in which three comparisons were made (four trials, 410 women). There were also studies included in which different types of laparoscopic hysterectomies were compared, including single-port versus multi-port (three trials, 203 women), total laparoscopic hysterectomy versus laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (one trial, 101 women) and mini-laparoscopic versus conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy (one trial, 76 women). The main outcomes were return to normal activities, satisfaction, quality of life and surgical complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that vaginal hysterectomy resulted in a quicker return to normal activities than abdominal hysterectomy. There was no evidence of a difference between them for our other main outcomes.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic hysterectomy also resulted in a quicker return to normal activities than abdominal hysterectomy. However, laparoscopic hysterectomies had a greater risk of damaging the bladder or ureter. There was no evidence of a difference between laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy or between laparoscopic and robot-assisted hysterectomy for our main outcomes.</P>
<P>We conclude that vaginal hysterectomy should be performed whenever possible. Where vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, both a laparoscopic approach and abdominal hysterectomy have their pros and cons and these should be incorporated in the decision-making process.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to August 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence for most comparisons was of low or moderate quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and wide confidence intervals around the estimate of effect.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-07 18:04:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Among women undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease, VH appears to be superior to LH and AH, as it is associated with faster return to normal activities. When technically feasible, VH should be performed in preference to AH because of more rapid recovery and fewer febrile episodes postoperatively. Where VH is not possible, LH has some advantages over AH (including more rapid recovery and fewer febrile episodes and wound or abdominal wall infections), but these are offset by a longer operating time. No advantages of LH over VH could be found; LH had a longer operation time, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) had more urinary tract injuries. Of the three subcategories of LH, there are more RCT data for laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and LH than for TLH. Single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy and RH should either be abandoned or further evaluated since there is a lack of evidence of any benefit over conventional LH. Overall, the evidence in this review has to be interpreted with caution as adverse event rates were low, resulting in low power for these comparisons. The surgical approach to hysterectomy should be discussed and decided in the light of the relative benefits and hazards. These benefits and hazards seem to be dependent on surgical expertise and this may influence the decision. In conclusion, when VH is not feasible, LH may avoid the need for AH, but LH is associated with more urinary tract injuries. There is no evidence that RH is of benefit in this population. Preferably, the surgical approach to hysterectomy should be decided by the woman in discussion with her surgeon.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-04 16:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-23 00:26:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. It is the most frequently performed major gynaecological surgical procedure, with millions of procedures performed annually throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 2005</LINK>). Hysterectomy can be performed for benign and malignant indications. Approximately 90% of hysterectomies are performed for benign conditions, such as fibroids causing abnormal uterine bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Flory-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flory 2005</LINK>). Other indications include endometriosis/adenomyosis, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and prolapse.</P>
<P>Abnormal menstrual bleeding affects women of all ages and is the most common gynaecological reason for referral to secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1999</LINK>). There are a variety of potential causes for abnormal or heavy menstrual bleeding; these include the abovementioned fibroids, endometrial polyps of hyperplasia, adenomyosis, infectious diseases, (early) pregnancy complications or (pre)malignant conditions of the endometrium. However, in a large proportion of women no definitive diagnosis will be confirmed. Several more or less invasive therapies exist for heavy menstrual bleeding; oral contraceptives or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) are often offered as a first-line treatment when uterine abnormalities are ruled out. A recent review showed that the LNG-IUS is the first-line medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding, with combined hormonal contraceptives as second choice (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2015</LINK>). During the last decade, several new techniques for endometrial ablation have been developed. The effectiveness of these techniques has been described in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2013</LINK>). As a result of this variety of treatment options, a patient with heavy menstrual bleeding finds herself confronted with a wide range of possible medical and surgical interventions. Since hysterectomy is the only treatment that provides permanent symptom relief, a rather large proportion of women with the abovementioned conditions will eventually choose to have their uterus removed. This is demonstrated by the fact that rates of hysterectomy have declined less than expected with the introduction of new treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Pynn_x00e4_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pynnä 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-04 16:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Approaches to hysterectomy may be broadly categorised into four options: abdominal hysterectomy (AH); vaginal hysterectomy (VH); laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) where at least some of the operation is conducted laparoscopically (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1994</LINK>), and robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RH).</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Abdominal hysterectomy</U>: The AH has traditionally been the surgical approach for gynaecological malignancy, when other pelvic pathology is present such as endometriosis or adhesions, and in the context of an enlarged uterus. It remains the 'fallback option' if the uterus cannot be removed by another approach. Mini-AH refers to an approach to hysterectomy where the abdominal incision does not exceed 7 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2008a</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Vaginal hysterectomy</U>: VH was originally used only for prolapse but has become more widely utilised for menstrual abnormalities such as dysfunctional uterine bleeding, when the uterus has a fairly normal size. Compared to AH, VH was (and still is) regarded as less invasive and seems to have the advantages of fewer blood transfusions, less febrile morbidity (fever) and less risk of injury to the ureter. However, the disadvantages are more bleeding complications and greater risk of bladder injury (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moen-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moen 2014a</LINK>).</LI>

<U>Laparoscopic hysterectomy</U>: LH usually refers to a hysterectomy where at least part of the operation is undertaken laparoscopically (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1994</LINK>). This approach requires general laparoscopic surgical expertise. The proportion of hysterectomies performed by LH has gradually increased and, although the surgery tends to take longer, its proponents argue that the main advantages are the possibility of diagnosing and treating other pelvic diseases such as endometriosis, of carrying out adnexal surgery including the removal of the ovaries, the ability to secure thorough intraperitoneal haemostasis (direct laparoscopic vision enables careful sealing of bleeding vessels at the end of the procedure), and a more rapid recovery time from surgery compared to AH (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1998</LINK>). Three sub-categorisations of LH have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Reich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reich 2003</LINK>), as follows:</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is where part of the hysterectomy is performed by laparoscopic surgery and part vaginally, but the laparoscopic component of the operation does not involve division of the uterine vessels.</LI>
<LI>Laparoscopic hysterectomy (which we have abbreviated to LH(a)) is where the uterine vessels are ligated laparoscopically but part of the operation is performed vaginally.</LI>
<LI>Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is where the entire operation (including suturing of the vaginal vault) is performed laparoscopically and there is no vaginal component except for the removal of the uterus. TLH requires the highest degree of laparoscopic surgical skills.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy and mini-laparoscopic hysterectomy</U>: In the last decade, single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy (SP-LH) and mini-laparoscopic hysterectomy (mini-LH, where the incisions do not exceed 3 mm, <LINK REF="STD-Ghezzi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ghezzi 2011</LINK>) have been introduced into the endoscopic field.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Robotic-assisted hysterectomy</U>: RH has been performed since 1998. In this review RH is considered as a separate approach, which may have its own learning curve, surgical pitfalls and accompanying costs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A total hysterectomy is the removal of the entire uterus including the cervix. When the cervix is not removed this is known as a subtotal or supracervical hysterectomy. Subtotal hysterectomies are most easily performed abdominally or laparoscopically, although it is possible to conserve the cervix in a VH or LAVH (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first reported elective hysterectomy was performed through a vaginal approach by Conrad Langenbeck in 1813. The first elective abdominal hysterectomy, a subtotal operation (where the cervix was conserved), was performed by Charles Clay in Manchester in 1863 (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1997</LINK>). These approaches remained the only two options until the latter part of the 20th century. The first laparoscopic hysterectomy (LAVH) was reported by Harry Reich in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Reich-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reich 1989</LINK>). He also reported the first total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) in 1993. Robotic-assisted hysterectomies have been performed since 1998.</P>
<P>Several patient factors may influence the surgeon's choice of approach to hysterectomy. For example, multiparous women with heavy menstrual bleeding who opt for hysterectomy may well be suitable for a vaginal approach. However, in the same case but with the suspicion of endometriosis based on dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia or both, the surgeon will more likely be inclined to an abdominal or laparoscopic approach. With regards to enlarged myomatous uteri, surgeons' experience and skills will largely determine the surgical approach to hysterectomy.</P>
<P>In common with the overall hysterectomy rate, the proportion of hysterectomies currently being performed by different approaches varies markedly across countries, within countries, and even between individual surgeons working within the same unit. As mentioned, each gynaecologist will have different indications for the approach to hysterectomy for benign disease, based largely on their own array of surgical skills and the patient characteristics such as uterine size and descent, extra-uterine pelvic pathology, previous pelvic surgery and other features such as obesity, nulliparity and the need for oophorectomy. Even though VH has been widely considered to be the operation of choice for abnormal uterine bleeding, the VALUE study has shown that, in 1995 in the UK, 67% of the hysterectomies performed for this indication were AH (<LINK REF="REF-Maresh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maresh 2002</LINK>). Previous caesarean section, for example, is often considered to be a contraindication for VH. However, this is not supported by cumulative data from four studies indicating no significant difference in complication rates in hysterectomy patients following caesarean section (8 of 430 (1.86%) versus 11 of 1227 (0.89%), P value = 0.12) (<LINK REF="REF-Agostini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2001</LINK> reported a prospective study on the learning curve in 10,110 hysterectomies for benign indications, of which 5875 were AH, 1801 were VH and 2434 were LH. As far as injuries to adjacent organs were concerned, the surgeons' experience significantly correlated inversely with the occurrence of urinary tract injuries in LH and the occurrence of bowel injuries in vaginal hysterectomy. In a following study the overall complication rates fell significantly in LH and markedly in VH over the course of 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>). Encouraging vaginal surgery amongst gynaecologists has been shown to be an effective method of increasing VH rates (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moen-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moen 2014a</LINK>). Finland had a VH rate as low as 7% in the 1980s. Following annual meetings on gynaecological surgery where vaginal and laparoscopic surgery were encouraged, and individual training provided, the VH rate increased to 44% in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>). In the same period of time, ureter injuries decreased, which represents an impressive national learning curve. In addition, the rate of LH increased (from 24% to 36%), with decreasing complication rates (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review will focus on the benefits and harms of the different surgical approaches to hysterectomy for benign indications. From the patient's perspective, quality of life may well be the most important outcome, especially in surgery for benign indications. Consequently, we will choose patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as primary outcomes. Injuries to adjacent organs are of concern in hysterectomy and their rates of occurrence differ with the various approaches to hysterectomy and surgical experience level (<LINK REF="REF-Brummer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brummer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>). It is important to have adequate knowledge of the differences in adverse outcomes in several approaches to hysterectomy, in order to inform patients properly and to gain informed consent based on an adequate amount of data. Furthermore, operation times differ with the different approaches to hysterectomy. Longer operating times are even more likely with RH. In general it is presumed that the vaginal and laparoscopic approach will lead to a quicker recovery compared with open surgery, mainly because of less pain and quicker mobilisation due to smaller incisions.</P>
<P>In the current era of limited healthcare resources, the costs of surgery will likely play a more important role in decision making. Several studies have looked at the subject of the cost-effectiveness of several types of hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bijen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pynn_x00e4_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pynnä 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarlos-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarlos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tapper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tapper 2014</LINK>). Overall, it is expected that VH will have the lowest costs, followed by AH and LH. Due to the high purchase costs and the use of expensive disposables, RH is likely to be the least cost-effective. However, there is lack of well-designed studies that also take societal costs (e.g. the costs of sick leave) into consideration.</P>
<P>Apart from the surgical approach to hysterectomy, other aspects of the surgical technique may have an effect on the outcome of surgery. Examples of this include total versus subtotal (where the cervix is not removed) hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2012</LINK>); Doderlein VH or LAVH versus standard VH or LAVH; techniques to support the vaginal vault; bilateral elective oophorectomy versus ovarian conservation (<LINK REF="REF-Orozco-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orozco 2014</LINK>); and other strategies used mainly by those conducting laparoscopic surgery with the aim of reducing the likelihood of complications, including the use of vaginal delineators, rectal probes and illuminated ureteric stents. These other aspects are not within the scope of this review (other than for assessing trial quality).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-23 00:50:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since there are multiple approaches to hysterectomy, each with their procedure-specific advantages and disadvantages, it is important to know which procedure is superior with respect to patient-related outcomes. In general, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) deliver the highest quality of evidence. When the quality of RCTs of surgical interventions is sufficiently good, this yields information unrivalled in its quality compared to studies of other designs that assess surgical interventions. It was interesting to note that in 1998 there was not a single RCT comparing AH and VH (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1998</LINK>). The introduction of the newer approaches to hysterectomy (LH, SP-LH and RH) has stimulated much greater interest in the scientific evaluation of all forms of hysterectomy. However, the more approaches exist, the more complex it becomes to decide on the best approach for each individual woman. This decision cannot be made without up-to-date evidence. Nor can it be made without knowing and respecting the informed preferences of patients. This review summarises the existing evidence presented in all published RCTs on benign conditions for hysterectomy. After finding and appraising the existing evidence, and integrating its inferences with clinical expertise, clinicians need to attempt a decision that reflects their patient's values and circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated in 2006, 2008 and 2009.</P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-04 16:50:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Surgical approaches to removal of the uterus, where at least one approach was compared with another, were eligible for inclusion. Approaches were as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Abdominal hysterectomy (AH, including mini-AH): AH involves removal of the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen.</LI>
<LI>Vaginal hysterectomy (VH): VH involves removal of the uterus via the vagina, with no abdominal incision.</LI>
<LI>Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH, including mini-LH and single-port (SP)-LH): LH involves the use of laparoscopy to perform hysterectomy. We made the distinction between the subcategories of LH based on whether ligation of the uterine vessels was undertaken laparoscopically and whether suturing of the vaginal vault was undertaken vaginally (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and this is further explained in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section. Thus we further subdivided LH in the analysis into LAVH, LH(a), TLH and non-categorisable LH (where there is insufficient information or the types of LH are too heterogeneous to otherwise sub-categorise). There are two other main classifications of LH available in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Nezhat-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nezhat 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1995</LINK>) and these are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, but we did not use these in the meta-analysis. We defined SP-LH as LH through one single port. Mini-LH involves the approach to LH through ports not exceeding 3 mm.</LI>
<LI>Robotic hysterectomy (RH): RH involves a hysterectomy approach using a robotic system, allowing more ergonomic movements that are easier to perform and are more precise in filtering tremor. One surgeon is seated in a robot console and handles the laparoscope and two to three laparoscopic instruments. RH is generally performed in a similar fashion to a TLH with suturing of the vaginal vault via the robot.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We thus excluded trials comparing, for example, different vessel sealing techniques within one approach.</P>
<P>Subtotal versus total hysterectomy is the scope of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2012</LINK>); we excluded trials making this comparison from the present review. We also excluded trials evaluating different surgical approaches to subtotal hysterectomy. However, if a minority of the women (less than 33%) had a subtotal hysterectomy and the comparison was made versus any of the three approaches outlined above then we included the trial.</P>
<P>Clinical data had to be reported in the included studies, thus excluding studies reporting only differences in laboratory results. If no relevant clinical outcomes were reported (i.e. not in the methods and results section), this was a criterion for exclusion.</P>

<P>Two review authors (at least two review authors from ET, AL, TN, JA and KK) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) for: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by referral to a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' tables, which we incorporated into the interpretation of the review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>
<P>If randomisation and allocation concealment were not sufficiently reported, we labelled these as unclear or high risk of bias (depending on the extent of description and whether the method described was satisfactory).</P>
<P>If blinding was not performed or not reported, we judged this as high risk of bias. </P>
<P>We considered dropout rates and/or loss to follow-up below 5% as low risk of bias. If dropouts or losses to follow-up were not reported or were between 10% and 15%, we judged this as unclear risk of bias. If the dropouts or losses to follow-up were substantial (i.e. more than 15%), we labelled this as high risk of bias.</P>
<P>If primary and/or secondary outcomes were not (pre)defined and/or a selection of outcomes was reported, we labelled this as unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Finally, we evaluated the studies included for any other potential bias, such as baseline data not comparable between groups or no description of surgeon experience. (Lack) of surgeon's experience could be particularly important when interpreting the results on, for instance, adverse events or operation time. This seems particularly important for the laparoscopic procedures, as studies have suggested that this technique has a specific learning curve. However, there is no clear-cut consensus based on current evidence as to how many procedures a surgeon needs to perform (for all types of hysterectomies) to pass this learning curve. Therefore, if a study stated that a surgeon had sufficient experience (without mentioning a specific number) we did not consider this as a potential risk of bias. Depending on the extent of any other bias identified in the study, we judged this as unclear or high risk of bias. If three or more potential other biases were identified, we marked this as high risk of bias.</P>

<P>We expressed dichotomous data as the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study and calculated Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). An increase in the odds of a particular outcome is displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre line, and a decrease in the odds of an outcome is displayed graphically to the left of the centre line.</P>
<P>For continuous data (e.g. length of hospital stay), if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales (e.g. change in haemoglobin), we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We treated ordinal data (e.g. quality of life scores) as continuous data. We presented 95% CIs for all outcomes.</P>
<P>Where data to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, median and (interquartile) ranges, P values). We did not repeat or check values of skewness or kurtosis from the individual studies. We did not include outcome variables that were reported only graphically in the review. We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they were presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

<P>Although all the trials used variations of the terms 'laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy' (LAVH) or 'laparoscopic hysterectomy', their definition varied according to what stages of the hysterectomy were completed laparoscopically and the point at which the operation continued vaginally. We included all trials with hysterectomies that had some laparoscopic component in the overall LH category. Using the <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1995</LINK> 'Staging of laparoscopic hysterectomy' table (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) we were able to categorise 39 of the 45 included studies that involved LH according to the amount of laparoscopic content. We also subcategorised these trials involving LH as either LAVH, LH(a) or TLH, depending on the extent of the surgery performed either laparoscopically or vaginally (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). If any trial included women undergoing different Richardson LH stages in the LH arm, we arbitrarily categorised the stage firstly, as the stage to which the surgeons had intended to go; secondly, if that information was not available, to the LH stage that most women underwent surgery; or thirdly, to the most advanced LH stage that women underwent. According to Richardson staging, one trial involved stage zero LH (<LINK REF="STD-Ottosen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ottosen 2000</LINK>), four trials were stage two (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kunz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kunz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raju-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raju 1994</LINK>), nine trials were stage three (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muzii-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muzii 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2003</LINK>), 10 trials were stage four where the uterine artery was transected laparoscopically (<LINK REF="STD-Darai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Darai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ellstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schutz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schutz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summitt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summitt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yuen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2009</LINK>), and 14 trials were stage five (<LINK REF="STD-Candiani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Candiani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falcone-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falcone 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghezzi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghezzi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghezzi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ghezzi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harkki_x002d_Siren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harkki-Siren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kluivers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kluivers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langebrekke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Langebrekke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perino-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perino 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarlos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sarlos 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seracchioli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seracchioli 2002</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-23 00:26:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regarding the primary outcomes of this review, vaginal hysterectomy proved to be the superior procedure since it was associated with the quickest return to normal activities and earliest discharge from hospital. Furthermore, vaginal hysterectomy had the shortest operation time compared to both laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy. Vaginal hysterectomy proved to be superior to laparoscopic hysterectomy regarding substantial bleeding, use of oral pain tablets on day two and hospital costs. Laparoscopic hysterectomy offered a number of statistically significant advantages over abdominal hysterectomy; among these were quicker return to normal activities, less postoperative pain, earlier discharge from hospital and improved quality of life in the first months and at four years after surgery; the cost was more urinary tract injuries and longer operating time. Single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy showed no significant advantages over conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy, besides better cosmetic outcomes. Robotic-assisted hysterectomy offered no significant advantages over laparoscopic hysterectomy; however operation time was significantly longer. In conclusion, it seems that whenever vaginal hysterectomy is possible, it should be the preferred route over other approaches. However, uncertainty remains about the safety of these procedures based on the low number of adverse events in this review. LH appeared to result in better long-term quality of life compared to AH; this is an important finding for the counselling of patients.</P>
<P>Urinary tract damage, in particular ureteric injury, remains the major concern related to the laparoscopic approach (<LINK REF="STD-Garry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>). However, this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was underpowered to detect a clinically significant increase in the incidence of bladder and ureter damage as separate entities from a laparoscopic approach. Many of the data for an increased incidence of urinary tract injury have come from non-randomised studies. Only large case series usually have the power to detect such rare complications, but RCTs remain the least biased way to assess the benefits and harms of an intervention. When we pooled bladder and ureter injuries in our meta-analysis under a single category 'urinary tract injury', we detected a significant increase in urinary tract injury for LH versus AH.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-03 12:17:55 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>It is particularly difficult to address the issues surrounding effectiveness and complications in surgical procedures where the skill base of surgeons is not only variable, but differs also regarding surgeon experience of 'traditional' operations and laparoscopic operations. This is likely to be especially relevant to the rates at which complications, such as ureteric damage, occur. Hysterectomy outcomes tend to improve the more experience a surgeon gains in a particular technique (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>). In contrast to exclusive assessment of numbers of performed operations, others have put emphasis on an intrinsic skills factor of each surgeon, which can only be monitored over time and in relation to the surgical case mix (<LINK REF="REF-Twijnstra-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twijnstra 2012</LINK>). There is no good way to assess the individual risk of rare complications per surgeon beyond the learning curve, but continuous monitoring of, for example, the CUSUM score, a tool to assess physicians&#8217; clinical competence, may help us forward in this respect.</P>
<P>The number of studies in the review was too low and the description of surgical skills was not specific enough to assess learning curve effects for the different routes of hysterectomy in a subgroup analysis. This is not just a hysterectomy issue but pervades many aspects of surgical therapy and surgical innovations. It does not apply to the same extent where drug therapy interventions are being studied, in which the efficacy is much less dependent on the skill of the investigator providing the treatment. Much of the Cochrane methodology has been developed based on the medical model of intervention.</P>
<P>Regarding the overall applicability of the evidence, it must be noted that most studies in this review had specific inclusion criteria. For example, studies including vaginal hysterectomy in one treatment arm had different exclusion criteria, ranging from a uterine size more than 14 or more than 16 weeks of gestational age, pelvic organ prolapse, chronic pelvic pain and a (subjectively assessed) narrow vagina. The same matter is relevant for laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy. These specific inclusion and exclusion criteria make it more or less difficult to extrapolate the findings to everyday practice, where one is confronted with patients that often have more than one problem or have a surgical history that surpasses that of most included patients in the studies in this review.</P>
<P>Until the 1990s, the vast majority of hysterectomies were performed abdominally (<LINK REF="REF-Reich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vessey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vessey 1992</LINK>), and routes of hysterectomy still vary widely per centre and country. In some countries there is a tendency to perform fewer abdominal hysterectomies in favour of other routes (<LINK REF="REF-Brummer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brummer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00e4_kinen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mäkinen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moen-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moen 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spilsbury-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spilsbury 2006</LINK>). In the current state of gynaecological practice and training, gynaecologists tend to become best trained in abdominal hysterectomy techniques, but there is huge variation in their learning curve position in relation to vaginal and laparoscopic hysterectomy techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Moen-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moen 2014b</LINK>). Numbers of hysterectomies are overall decreasing with the introduction of more uterus-preserving techniques in benign gynaecology (e.g. ablation techniques, Mirena intrauterine device (IUD)). For example, in the Netherlands, subspecialty has already been introduced in gynaecology training, which implies that not all gynaecologists will be able to self dependently perform a hysterectomy at the end of their training. The expected advantage is that the trainees who decide for a surgical profile will become better trained in hysterectomy.</P>
<P>In clinical practice as well as in the trials included in this review, vaginal hysterectomy will be mostly performed under optimum conditions only, whereas abdominal hysterectomy remains the default intervention for all more difficult cases. Each gynaecologist (as has been the case since abdominal hysterectomy became the alternative to vaginal hysterectomy, in 1863) will have his or her own indications for the choice of approach to hysterectomy for benign disease. These choices may be influenced to some extent by the results from scientific evidence (for example this review) but the decisions will also be largely based on their own array of surgical skills and the patient characteristics. Whether there will be more of a consensus in the future than there has been to date, regarding these indications for route of hysterectomy, is less certain. To reach this consensus, however, should probably not be the ultimate goal since the prudent decision for one approach to hysterectomy over the other may be very justified and may lead to better outcomes after all.</P>
<P>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly recognised as important outcomes for medical interventions. PROMs (e.g. quality of life, patient experiences) can show the impact of surgery and complications on patients' lives, and thus can be a leading argument in the discussion about the best way to perform a hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2010</LINK>). For instance, speed of recovery is determined by the avoidance of an abdominal procedure: abdominal hysterectomy is associated with lengthier recovery than all other approaches to hysterectomy. Only a few studies in the meta-analysis have used quality of life as an outcome measure and only one study reported the long-term (four years) effect on quality of life. However, the quality of life data do not lend themselves easily to meta-analysis (due to the use of diverse tools, time frames and statistical analysis). The available data indicate that the laparoscopic and vaginal procedures performed better or equally compared with abdominal hysterectomy as far as quality of life in the first weeks after the procedure was concerned. Laparoscopic hysterectomy performed better after four years. In the decision as to the approach to hysterectomy, the advantage of better quality of life should be offset against the disadvantages. Meta-analysis of PROMs, such as quality of life, would benefit from the use of well-validated instruments applied in a standardised manner in future studies.</P>
<P>One concern is the statistical heterogeneity of the trials included in this review. The heterogeneity in such outcomes as operating time, even when the 'traditional' hysterectomy vaginal versus abdominal techniques are compared, directly relates to the fact that some surgeons are better trained in and thus perform faster either type of hysterectomy. This heterogeneity might be expected to be even more apparent when laparoscopic hysterectomy is compared with either abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Sculpher et al have analysed learning curve in the eVALuate trial (<LINK REF="REF-Sculpher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sculpher 2004</LINK>). The conclusion was that after completing the mandatory 25 cases to qualify for participation in the study, there was no surgical learning curve demonstrated, neither in seniority and experience nor related to the place in the timeline of the study.</P>
<P>Another point of discussion relates to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in several studies. Particularly the studies including an abdominal hysterectomy arm excluded women who were not eligible for the less invasive approaches to hysterectomy. This results in an abdominal hysterectomy population that is not representing the entire abdominal hysterectomy population in our clinical practice, but a population of only those women who were eligible for vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy as well.</P>
<P>Furthermore, studies typically do not address the same outcomes. This makes it difficult to draw clinically relevant conclusions. Increasingly it has been recognised that a standardised collection of core outcomes is needed. This resulted in the CROWN (CoRe Outcomes in WomeN's health) initiative, in which the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group also participates (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2014</LINK>). With respect to this review, it would be worth the effort to develop a core set of outcomes for the evaluation of hysterectomy.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence for the comparisons included in this review is mainly graded as low or moderate, resulting in uncertainty regarding the effects on primary and secondary outcomes between the different approaches to hysterectomy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Limitations in the evidence included imprecision of results and inadequate reporting of study methods (e.g. randomisation and allocation procedure, no predefined primary and secondary outcomes). The 'Summary of findings' tables show the quality of evidence for our primary outcomes for the three main comparisons. With regard to abdominal versus vaginal hysterectomy there was a large difference in return to normal activities between the different studies, although all results were in favour of vaginal hysterectomy. In two studies, studying urinary tract injury, there was doubt about the method used for random sequence generation.<BR/>With regard to laparoscopic versus abdominal hysterectomy doubt existed about the method used for random sequence generation or allocation of patients. There was a large difference in return to normal activities between the different studies, although all results were in favour of laparoscopic hysterectomy. Furthermore, there were wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect present.</P>
<P>Also, with regard to the comparison between laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect were present. In some studies, studying urinary tract injury and unintended laparotomy, there was doubt about the method used for random sequence generation or allocation of patients. In some trials, studying complications, it was unclear how participants were randomised and allocated to their study group.</P>
<P>The majority of trials had unblinded participants, mostly imputed to the nature of the intervention (e.g. vaginal hysterectomy resulting in no abdominal scar in contrast with abdominal hysterectomy). However, as for example <LINK REF="STD-Miskry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miskry 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2013</LINK> showed, sham abdominal dressings could be applied to blinded participants. This is particularly beneficial for unbiased patient-reported outcomes, such as postoperative pain, satisfaction or quality of life. Trials studying short-term outcomes in short follow-up periods, had minimal missing data. However, importantly, some of the trials evaluating long-term outcomes, such as quality of life (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Garry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 2004</LINK>), had significant numbers lost to follow-up. Therefore, the outcomes of these studies have to be interpreted with caution. An important reason for the low quality of evidence was imprecision of results, particularly resulting from the low number of adverse events in terms of intraoperative and major long-term complications per study. This is important to take into account when interpreting the results regarding the safety of each type of hysterectomy.</P>
<P>Most outcomes for the comparisons between laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy, as well as laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy, are based on the large trial by <LINK REF="STD-Garry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 2004</LINK>, with a moderate risk of bias and most importantly a high rate of incomplete outcome data. <LINK REF="STD-Garry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 2004</LINK> performed the largest trial (n = 1380) and used major complications as the primary outcome. The recruitment target was met in the laparoscopic versus abdominal hysterectomy arm but not in the laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy arm. With regard to the comparison between vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy, the conclusions are based on six trials with comparable sample sizes and low risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis has led to some changes in statistical significance in various variables on bleeding and blood loss. Complication rates, operation times and recovery times did not change with the exclusion of trials with more detrimental trial quality.</P>
<P>In conclusion, further research is at least likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>

<P>We used a rigorous process to identify all relevant studies, but we excluded grey literature. Some attempts to contact authors of studies lacking sufficient data to include them in this review were not successful. Four so-called multi-arm trials have been included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ottosen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ottosen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2008a</LINK>), where data have been used twice in different comparisons. There is not an agreed approach to this problem. Since no large effects of correlation and non-independence of data are expected on the resulting conclusions, we took no special measures in the review to address this issue. Similar correlation between the two trials and inter-dependence of data might be present in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Garry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 2004</LINK>, where the surgeon, and not randomisation, made the decision in which trial a patient was included. We followed procedures to reduce other potential bias in the review process.</P>

<P>Several other reviews and studies have evaluated different approaches to hysterectomy. <LINK REF="REF-Kovac-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovac 2014</LINK> reported that the evidence demonstrated that, in general, vaginal hysterectomy is associated with better outcomes and has fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomy. This is also the conclusion from the Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, it is mentioned that laparoscopic hysterectomy is an alternative to abdominal hysterectomy for those women for whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. Overall, this is in accordance with the conclusions from this review. <LINK REF="REF-Pynn_x00e4_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pynnä 2014</LINK> performed a systematic review of studies that have investigated the cost-effectiveness of hysterectomy for benign gynaecological disease. They concluded that the cost-effectiveness of hysterectomy has been surprisingly poorly studied and that conclusions are difficult to draw due to the different study designs, indications, follow-up times and quality of life instruments used. Laparoscopic hysterectomy seemed to be the least cost-effective in their review, although further data from original patient cohorts with long-term follow-up are needed. However, they did not include any studies with robot-assisted hysterectomy and not all studies included cost derived from sick leave. <LINK REF="REF-Smorgick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smorgick 2014</LINK> studied he benefits and challenges of robotic-assisted hysterectomy. Conforming with our review, they found that recent studies comparing robotic and laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications have not demonstrated a clear advantage for either approach in terms of complications, blood loss and hospital stay. The higher cost of robotic hysterectomy remains a significant disadvantage of this approach, although the total cost may decrease with increasing surgeon experience (via shorter operative time) and may be offset in some circumstances by reduced hospital stay and cost of complications compared with abdominal hysterectomy. It is expected that when more robotic consoles enter the market, prices will drop and cost-effectiveness may move into the direction of that in laparoscopic hysterectomy. Furthermore, better ergonomic circumstances in robotic-assisted hysterectomy will likely have the benefit of fewer physical complaints in laparoscopic surgeons and, consequently, less cost regarding surgeons absenteeism.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-04 16:59:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Among women undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease, vaginal hysterectomy appears to be superior to laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy, as it is associated with a speedier return to normal activities. When technically feasible, vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy because of more rapid recovery and fewer febrile episodes postoperatively. Where vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, laparoscopic hysterectomy has some advantages over abdominal hysterectomy (including less operative blood loss, more rapid recovery, fewer febrile episodes, and fewer wound or abdominal wall infections) but these are offset by a longer operating time. No advantages of laparoscopic over vaginal hysterectomy could be found; laparoscopic hysterectomy had a longer operation time, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy had more urinary tract injuries. Of the three subcategories of laparoscopic hysterectomy, there are more randomised controlled trial (RCT) data for laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and LH(a) than for total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The surgical approach to hysterectomy should be decided by the woman in discussion with her surgeon in light of the relative benefits and hazards. These benefits and hazards seem to be dependent on surgical expertise and this may influence the decision. Single-port laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hysterectomy should be either abandoned or further evaluated since there is a lack of evidence of any benefit over conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. However, this has to be interpreted with caution as adverse event rates were low, resulting in low power for these outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-04 16:59:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The concept of evidence-based gynaecological surgery has been challenged based on the many pitfalls in being able to successfully undertake RCTs to assess surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2009</LINK>), however our extensive systematic review of surgical approaches to hysterectomy shows the concept of evidence-based gynaecological surgery to be alive and well. When the quality of RCTs of surgical interventions is sufficiently good, this yields information unrivalled in its quality compared to studies of other designs that assess surgical interventions. There is no longer any excuse not to undertake high quality trials of surgical interventions.</P>
<P>The enhanced evidence on short-term outcomes and adverse events generated by this meta-analysis would benefit from large study populations, with surgeons well beyond their learning curve. Since laparoscopic hysterectomy was introduced 20 years ago and adequate training programmes are available, studies undertaken during the learning curve will not be helpful for making choices in current clinical practice. We also recommend that future trials should stratify allocation by surgeon, so that there is a balance of procedures performed by each surgeon in both arms. It should, however, be noted that outcomes for patients treated by the same surgeon will be correlated, and that failure to account for this will lead to incorrect inferences in the individual studies.</P>
<P>More high quality research would be welcome regarding the long-term effects of the different approaches to hysterectomy, such as pelvic organ dysfunction.</P>
<P>The various subcategories of laparoscopic hysterectomy may be further evaluated against each other. For example, whether total laparoscopic hysterectomy has any benefits or harms in comparison to other forms of laparoscopic hysterectomy (including LH(a) and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy). The increase in the rate of ureteric injury resulting from laparoscopic hysterectomy, suggested by very large observational studies, remains to be conclusively proven by RCT data. We strongly encourage trial authors to report their laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy according to our defined subcategories: laparoscopic-assisted vaginal, LH(a), total laparoscopic and subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This should minimise the confusion that has prevailed in the first published literature on laparoscopic hysterectomy. Single-port laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hysterectomy should be performed in clinical trials only, since there is lack of evidence of any benefit over conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. The claimed superior ergonomics of robotic hysterectomy has not been shown to give rise to enhanced patients outcomes.</P>
<P>Although it is important that RCTs should have the same surgeon (or group of surgeons) carrying out each of the approaches being compared, different levels of expertise with each approach means that such RCTs are always likely to be statistically heterogeneous when considered for pooling in meta-analyses.</P>
<P>There is an absence of data for long-term outcomes in RCTs comparing surgical approaches to hysterectomy. RCTs should aim to report long-term outcomes, including urinary, bowel and sexual function, along with occurrence of fistulae. Quality of life or other PROMs may be regarded as key outcomes in trials on approaches to hysterectomy for benign disease to capture the patient's perspective. To enable meta-analysis of quality of life data, well-validated instruments should be applied in a standardised manner.</P>

<B>LAVH arm</B>: 10 mm laparoscope introduced through the umbilicus, and 3 accessory 5 mm reusable trocars were introduced suprapubically. The pelvis and upper abdomen were then accurately evaluated, and endometriotic lesions, adhesions or ovarian cysts, when present, were treated appropriately. When the ovaries were to be conserved, bipolar forceps and scissors were used to resect the round and uteroovarian ligaments with the fallopian tubes<BR/>For adnexectomy, bipolar forceps and scissors were used to resect the round and infundibulopelvic ligaments, mesosalpinx, and mesovarium. Opening of the bladder flap was performed at the laparoscopic phase, whereas bladder dissection was performed during the vaginal phase. Laparoscopic haemostasis was achieved using exclusively bipolar electrocoagulation. The vaginal phase included circular incision of the vagina; bladder dissection to the laparoscopically opened bladder flap; entry in the posterior cul-de-sac; and clamping, transecting, and suture ligating of uterosacral ligaments, base of cardinal ligaments, and uterine vessels. Where necessary, wedge morcellation, coring or bivalving was performed.

<B> arm</B>: all patients were prescribed a second-generation cephalosporin as well as metronidazole intravenously during the operation and by oral administration for 2 days after surgery. Ureters were identified, where this was difficult, the ureters were dissected free down to the level of the uterine arteries. If the adnexa were to be removed, the infundibulopelvic ligaments were transected by diathermal cautery and monopolar scissors. If the adnexa were to be conserved the utero-ovarian pedicles were transected on both sides, using the same instruments. The round ligaments and the upper portion of the broad ligaments were divided using monopolar scissors and the bladder was dissected to the level just below the vaginal cuff. The posterior part of the broad ligaments were divided by scissors close to the uterus, down to the upper part of the uterosacral ligaments, which were then transected. The uterine arteries were transected close to the uterus after bipolar coagulation. The upper portion of the cardinal ligaments were divided close to the uterus, after which an incision was made into the anterior fornix of the vagina. The vaginal phase: vaginal epithelium surrounding the cervix was transected as well as any residual tissue from the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. The transected ligaments were ligated together and incorporated into the vaginal wall<BR/>

<BR/>
<B>TLH arm</B>: after a CO<SUB>2</SUB> pneumoperitoneum was created, a 10 mm trocar was placed in the umbilical site to introduce the laparoscope and the camera. 3 ancillary 5 m trocars were placed suprapubically. After an abdominal inspection, lysis of any adhesions was performed, the uterus was then mobilised. After bipolar coagulation, the round ligament was sectioned at 3 cm from the uterus. The areolar tissue of the broad ligament was then dissected and its posterior fold fenestrated at an avascular area above the uterine vessels. The infundibulo-pelvic ligament vessels were coagulated and cut using bipolar forceps and scissors under direct visualisation of the pelvic ureter. Once the uterine ligaments were sectioned, the operation continued centrally in a downward direction. If the adnexae were not to be removed, the utero-ovarian ligament was coagulated and sectioned proximal to the ovaries. The vesico-uterine peritoneal fold was opened by scissors and a bladder dissection from the low uterine segment down to the upper part of the vagina was performed. The utero-sacral ligaments were then coagulated and sectioned. The uterine artery was skeletonised and then coagulated with bipolar forceps and cut with scissors. Incision and coagulation of the cardinal ligaments to expose the vaginal fornices, separated from the stump of the uterine artery. Circular colpotomy was then performed and the uterus was removed from the vagina. The vaginal vault was then sutured laparoscopically or vaginally<BR/>

<B>AH + BSO versus LH (LAVH) + BSO</B>
<BR/>
<B>LAVH + BSO arm</B>: 5.5 mm flap-valved trocars were inserted enabling the insertion of laparoscopic instruments. 12 mm trocar and cannula were introduced suprapubically in the midline 3 cm above the upper border of the symphysis pubis as a port for the use of the Autosuture Multifire Endo GIA 30 stapling device.The cervix was grasped with a vulsellum and a broad-ended blunt uterine curette was inserted to manipulate the uterus from the perineal end. Any adhesions between the uterus or adnexae to adjacent structures were divided with scissors after diathermy coagulation. Both round ligaments were treated with diathermy and cut with scissors approximately 3 cm from the internal inguinal ring whilst holding the ligament with a grasping forceps. The peritoneum of the anterior leaf of the broad ligament was dissected from the divided round ligament back towards the infundibulo-pelvic ligament thus opening the tissue space between the 2 folds of broad ligament. The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was then pierced with endoshears to make a window, a safe distance above the ureter which had been previously identified. The ovarian pedicle was then sized for thickness of tissue by means of a GIA endo gauge inserted through the midline suprapubic incision. The correct size of endo stapling clamp was selected. The ovarian pedicle was clamped and cut with the appropriate GIA endo stapling device, placed from the upper border of the infundibulo-pelvic ligament and with the jaws of the stapler passing well through the peritoneal window in the broad ligament. By using this technique each ovarian pedicle required only one firing of the GIA stapler to divide it. Finally the uterovesical fold of the peritoneum was divided with scissors and sometimes the uterosacral ligaments were divided after diathermy coagulation. The uterus, tubes and both ovaries were then removed vaginally after circumcising the cervix and opening the pouch of Douglas to allow ligation and division of the cardinal ligaments and uterine vessels as in a traditional vaginal hysterectomy. The vaginal vault was anchored to the cardinal ligaments and closed with interrupted sutures<BR/>

<BR/>
<B>LH arm</B>: the laparoscope was inserted sub-umbilical incision, and usually 2 5 mm secondary portals were used for the laparoscopic instruments. Surgery was performed under the guidance of the image generated by a Supercam 9050 PB video chip camera attached to a 30 degree forward oblique laparoscope. The principal method of haemostasis was bipolar electrosurgical desiccation but Endo-GIA 30 linear staplers were used in 8 women. In 1 woman VH was done after diagnostic laparoscopy (stage 0 VH) and in 2 VH was carried out after laparoscopic adhesiolysis had made this possible (stage 1 LH). When the ovaries were conserved, bipolar diathermy was used medially to desiccate the round and ovarian ligaments, and the fallopian tube. The approach to the ovarian pedicle during oophorectomy depended on whether the uterine vessels were to be divided laparoscopically or vaginally. If divided vaginally, the ovarian vessels were coagulated and divided but not the round ligaments. Dissection then proceeded towards the uterine origin of the round ligament, after which the hysterectomy was completed vaginally (stage 2 LH) or after laparoscopic mobilisation of the bladder (stage 3 LH). If the uterine vessels were treated laparoscopically (stage 4 LH), the round ligaments were always divided, together with the ovarian vessels and fallopian tubes, and the dissection continued to the level of the uterine arteries which were then desiccated and cut close to the uterus. Laparoscopic dissection only continued further than the uterine artery in 3 cases (stage 5 LH), all other procedures being completed vaginally<BR/>

The identification was made coming from either the internal umbilical ligament or the pararectal fossa. Prior to coagulation of the uterine artery, the ureter was identified and pushed medially. After coagulation, it was left to the discretion of the surgeon to transect the uterine artery.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Simple random allocation of study participants to 2 surgical procedure groups was done by using envelopes numbered from 001 to 200. While assigning groups to envelopes, if the computer-generated random number was odd, the assigned group was A (non-descent vaginal hysterectomy) for the first (001 numbered) envelope. A card with <B>Group-A: ND vaginal hysterectomy</B> written over it was put inside the envelope. The next envelope was then taken and next random number was checked. If the random number was even, the envelope was assigned to group B: abdominal hysterectomy. A card with <B>Group-B: abdominal hysterectomy</B> written over it was put inside the envelope no 002. Similarly cards with group-A/B written over them were put inside sequentially numbered envelopes by matching with odd/even random numbers as generated by computer. 1<SUP>st</SUP> patient for the clinical trial was allocated to the group assigned to the envelope no-001, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> patient was allotted to the group assigned to the envelope no.002. In this way 200 participants were allocated into 2 intervention groups and eventually the numbers in 2 groups were 100 in group A and 100 in group B</P>
