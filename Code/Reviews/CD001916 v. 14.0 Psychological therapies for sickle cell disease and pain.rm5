<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-19 21:20:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sickle cell disease is a group of blood disorders. It can cause anaemia, which if severe can reduce mobility. It may also allow small blood vessels to become blocked causing pain in muscle and bone and it can damage major organs such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, and lungs. People with sickle cell disease are more vulnerable to severe infections. Treatment is usually in response to symptoms and designed to ease pain. Psychological treatment to help people cope with sickle cell disease might complement current medical treatment. There are four types of treatment: patient education; cognitive therapy (to do with thoughts and feelings); behavioural therapy (to do with actions); psychodynamic psychotherapy (talking to relieve emotional pain). We searched for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which compared psychological treatments to each other or to no treatment in sickle cell disease. We included seven studies in the review, of which five, with 260 people, had data we could enter into the review. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy reduced the affective part of pain (feelings about pain), but not the sensory part (pain intensity). Another study of this therapy had inconclusive results for coping strategies and showed no difference on how different groups used the health service. A study using cognitive behavioural therapy with teenagers and their families at home did not show any difference when compared with education about sickle cell disease. One education study did not show a reduction in depression. Furthermore, one study in patient education helped improve attitudes to healthcare workers and medication use in adolescents and young adults. The authors believe that some patient education seems relevant for children, adolescents and young adults, while methods to improve the ability to cope in both children and adults are important. Nonetheless, these results may not apply to across all ages, clinical severity, types of pain (acute or chronic) that people with sickle cell disease have, or which country they live in. More research needs to be done in this area.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-08 11:48:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic blood disorders. It occurs when the sickle haemoglobin gene is inherited from both parents. The effects of the condition are: varying degrees of anaemia which, if severe, can reduce mobility; a tendency for small blood capillaries to become blocked causing pain in muscle and bone commonly known as 'crises'; damage to major organs such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, and lungs; and increased vulnerability to severe infections. There are both medical and non-medical complications, and treatment is usually symptomatic and palliative in nature. Psychological interventions for individuals with sickle cell disease might complement current medical treatment, and studies of their efficacy have yielded encouraging results. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-04 13:16:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve studies were identified in the searches and seven of these were eligible for inclusion in the review. Five studies, involving 260 participants, provided data for analysis. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy significantly reduced the affective component of pain (feelings about pain), mean difference -0.99 (95% confidence interval -1.62 to -0.36), but not the sensory component (pain intensity), mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval -9.39 to 9.39). One study of family psycho-education was not associated with a reduction in depression. Another study evaluating cognitive behavioural therapy had inconclusive results for the assessment of coping strategies, and showed no difference between groups assessed on health service utilisation. In addition, family home-based cognitive behavioural therapy did not show any difference compared to disease education. One study of patient education on health beliefs showed a significant improvement in attitudes towards health workers, mean difference -4.39 (95% CI -6.45 to -2.33) and medication, mean difference -1.74 (95% CI -2.98 to -0.50). Nonetheless, these results may not apply across all ages, severity of sickle cell disease, types of pain (acute or chronic), or setting.</P>

<P>Evidence for the efficacy of psychological therapies in sickle cell disease is currently limited.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-08 21:57:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 21:57:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic disorders of haemoglobin predominantly affecting people originating from areas where malaria is found. The sickle cell gene, being an adaptation against malaria, is prevalent in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Middle East, Mediterranean and Southern Europe. Nonetheless, global migration appears to be changing the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2014</LINK>). The global affected population appears to be on the increase, and is now estimated at over 300,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease occurs when the haemoglobin variant HbS gene is inherited from both parents, i.e. sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), which is the most common (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>), or when the HbS gene is inherited from one parent and another haemoglobin variant gene from the other, such as haemoglobin sickle cell disease (HbSC) or sickle-ß-thalassaemia (S-ß-Thal). Sickle cell trait, the 'carrier' state, is the inheritance of the HbS gene from one parent and the normal haemoglobin (HbA) gene from the other. These individuals are free of symptoms relating to sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease causes a lot of problems for affected individuals. The effects of the illness are: varying degrees of anaemia, which if severe reduce the capacity for mobility; intermittent obstruction of blood vessels causing attacks of pain in muscle and bone, known as vaso-occlusive 'crises'; damage to major organs such as the brain, liver, kidneys, lungs and spleen; and increased vulnerability to severe infections. Numerous complications can occur and affect any organ of the body. Life threatening complications include acute chest syndrome, splenic or hepatic sequestration and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). Also, children may be at risk of cognitive impairment as a result of strokes or subtle neurological conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current treatment is mainly aimed at reducing symptoms of sickle cell disease: pain is controlled with analgesics, hydration, application of heat, and other complementary methods; transfusions are given to correct severe anaemia, prevent strokes, and for other complications such as acute chest syndrome; infections are treated with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). Bone marrow transplantation can prevent, stabilise or reverse complications associated with sickle cell disease, and has an expanded role in recent times (<LINK REF="REF-Bola_x00f1_os_x002d_Meade-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolaños-Meade 2012</LINK>). This is a major procedure, which cannot be routinely offered because of age restrictions and the difficulty of finding suitable donors. Treatment with hydroxyurea has been shown to raise the level of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) and decrease cellular dehydration in people with HbSS (<LINK REF="REF-Cokic-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cokic 2003</LINK>). It is therefore very effective in preventing and reducing the rate of painful episodes and the subsequent number of hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Charache-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charache 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain is one of the most significant symptoms experienced in the daily lives of affected individuals. Its onset, chronicity and severity are unpredictable, idiosyncratic and distinguishable from other types of pain. Painful episodes have been reported to be highest among those aged 20 to 29 years and are a predictor of early death, decreasing steadily after 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1991</LINK>). Although sickle cell pain may not be present all the time, recurrent acute episodes occur throughout life and may require frequent hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Aljuburi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aljuburi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 21:57:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychologically, there is considerable variability in the ability of people with sickle cell disease to cope with painful episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Anie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gil-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gil 1989</LINK>). Some people with sickle cell disease cope relatively well with pain: they work; are active socially and recreationally; and are well adjusted psychologically. Others cope poorly; they lead more limited lives and are very reliant on acute services for their pain management, thus posing a challenge to clinicians. Distress, disability and reduced quality of life as a result of pain associated with sickle cell disease are common (<LINK REF="REF-Ballas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>As in other chronic pain conditions, cognitive and behavioural therapies have been considered as adjuncts to routine medical treatment for the management of sickle cell pain. These interventions aimed to improve the ability of people with sickle cell disease to cope with their pain, have shown encouraging results in children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>), and with incorporated treatment manuals (<LINK REF="REF-Anie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anie 2002</LINK>).</P>

The overall risk of bias comprises five 'risk domains', with each domain classified as 'low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear risk' of bias. The five risk of bias domains are:</P>

<LI>generation of the allocation sequence (does the trial use an acceptable method of generating the random sequence for allocating participants to treatment arm?);</LI>

<LI>incomplete outcome data (were incomplete outcome data a problem in the trial and were the trial methods of dealing with these missing data adequate?);</LI>

<P>This was assessed in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2010</LINK>). Gil examined experimental pain sensitivity calibrated to noxious stimulation in both studies, with results indicating reduction in the tendency to report laboratory pain following coping skills training in children or adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>), and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>) compared with control conditions (didactic discussion sessions). However, data reported could not be entered into the statistical analysis.</P>
<P>Pain frequency was assessed in one study with a pain diary by calculating the proportion (percentage) of days with pain (<LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2010</LINK>). Cognitive behavioural family therapy compared with attention control did not reduce pain frequency post intervention, MD -0.69 (95% CI -13.56 to 12.18) or at 12 months follow up, MD 8.87 (95% CI -3.33 to 21.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The total score of 15 pain descriptor words rated from zero (no pain) to three (severe pain) on the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to assess pain severity. Cognitive behavioural group therapy as opposed to no intervention significantly reduced the affective component, MD -0.99 (95% CI -1.62 to -0.36) but not the sensory component of pain severity, MD 0.00 (95% CI -9.39 to 9.39) (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3<I>.</I> Coping strategies</HEADING>
<P>These were evaluated in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Broome-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Broome 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2010</LINK>). Gil used the CSQ-SCD for both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>). In children or adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1997</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>), brief training in coping skills compared with control conditions (didactic discussions) increased coping attempts, and decreased negative thinking. Data reported could not be entered into the statistical analysis.</P>
<P>Thomas also used the CSQ-SCD. However, data reported from the analysis of this questionnaire were insufficient to ascertain whether cognitive behavioural therapy improved coping ability compared to no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>). Data reported from this instrument were ordinal categorical, which could not be entered into the statistical analysis.</P>
<P>Broome used the Schoolagers' Coping Strategies Inventory (<LINK REF="STD-Broome-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Broome 2001</LINK>). This is a 26-item self-report instrument designed to yield two scores of frequency and effectiveness of coping strategies used by children (including distraction, relaxation, social support and drawing). Data on two scores of frequency and effectiveness were not reported either at baseline or post-intervention. Thus, we were unable to determine whether cognitive behavioural techniques helped with coping as compared to no intervention.</P>
<P>Bakarat employed the CSQ-SCD (<LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2010</LINK>). Cognitive behavioural therapy compared with attention control did not reveal any significant improvements in coping attempts post intervention, MD 3.03 (95% CI -17.73 to 23.79) or at 12 months follow up, MD 11.50 (95% CI -9.35 to 32.35) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>

However, in two studies insufficient outcome data were reported to determine whether cognitive behavioural therapy compared with control or no intervention had an effect on health service utilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Gil-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gil 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>). As a result, no data were entered into the statistical analysis for either study.</P>
<P>Broome measured: the number of visits to hospital emergency departments; to outpatient clinics; and hospital admissions for 12 months prior to the intervention. Compared with controls, children did not show any significant changes in health service utilisation according to these measures: emergency visits, MD -0.30 (95% CI -2.04 to 1.44); hospital admissions, MD 1.00 (95% CI -1.91 to 3.91); clinic visits, MD 1.40 (95% CI -1.42 to 4.22) (<LINK REF="STD-Broome-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Broome 2001</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bakarat reviewed medical charts for 12 months SCD outpatient clinic visits pre- and post-baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2010</LINK>).

Cognitive behavioural therapy compared with no intervention showed a significant reduction in the role of external factors on the control of pain in both the role of chance events or happenings, MD -4.50 (95% CI -7.19 to -1.81), and in the role of powerful others, MD -4.50 (95% CI -6.84 to -2.16) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-01-19 20:29:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with sickle cell disease and their families have to cope with a chronic condition, which causes psychological distress and affects their quality of life. Therefore, psychological interventions are indicated to complement medical treatment for effective management. These studies suggest that interventions, which focus on education about sickle cell disease, are effective in improving knowledge and attitudes about the condition in both children and adolescents (young people) and carers. Such educational programmes could perhaps be used as the first step in psychological interventions for people with sickle cell disease. Cognitive and behavioural therapies may also be helpful but their effectiveness still remains unclear because of the poor quality of the studies.</P>
<P>These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the results cannot necessarily be generalised across all ages, clinical severity, types of pain (acute or chronic) experienced by people with sickle cell disease, or patient populations.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The quality of the studies included in this review was not sufficient to allow firm conclusions about the efficacy of psychological interventions to be made at the present time. Nonetheless, patient education seems relevant for children and adolescents, while methods to improve the ability to cope in both children and adults are important.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is needed using a structured approach to assess psychological therapies, taking into account both demographic and clinical variables. Well-designed, adequately-powered studies should incorporate treatment manuals for consistency and to allow replication. Future studies should also help in identifying the most important components of psychological interventions relevant to different sickle cell populations, and in testing the efficacy of different therapy formats, e.g. individual versus group. Similar outcome measures should also be used, both within and between different sickle cell patient groups. Multicentre collaboration, perhaps international, may be needed for this purpose. </P>
<P>Subsequent reviews such as this would be improved if future trial publications reported data more fully.</P>
