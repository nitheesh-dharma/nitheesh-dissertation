<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-07 23:29:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The drugs amantadine and rimantadine can both help prevent and relieve the symptoms of influenza A in adults, but amantadine has more adverse effects.</P>
<P>The flu can be caused by many different viruses. One type is influenza A, with headaches, coughs and runny noses that can last for many days and lead to serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Amantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs. The review of trials found that both drugs are similarly helpful in relieving the symptoms of influenza A in adults, but only when there is a high probability that the cause of the flu is influenza A (a known epidemic, for example). It is likely that neither drug will interrupt the spread of influenza A and by treating symptoms may encourage viral spread in the community by people who are feeling better but are still infectious. Resistance of influenza viruses to amantadine is a serious worldwide problem as shown by recent surveys. Both drugs have adverse gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) effects, but amantadine can also have serious effects on the nervous system. They should only be used in an emergency when all other measures fail.</P>

<P>Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine) and rimantadine hydrochloride (rimantadine) have antiviral properties, but they are not widely used due to a lack of knowledge of their potential value and concerns about possible adverse effects.</P>
<P>This review was first published in 1999 and updated for the fourth time in April 2008.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-09-07 23:19:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety ('effects') of amantadine and rimantadine in healthy adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-10 13:57:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April Week 4, 2008), EMBASE (1990 to April 2008) and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing amantadine and/or rimantadine with placebo, control medication or no intervention, or comparing doses or schedules of amantadine and/or rimantadine in healthy adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-07 23:24:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>For prophylaxis (prevention) trials we analysed the numbers of participants with clinical influenza (influenza-like-illness or ILI) or with confirmed influenza A and adverse effects. Analysis for treatment trials was of the mean duration of fever, length of hospital stay and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-07 23:25:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Amantadine prevented 25% of ILI cases (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 36%), and 61% of influenza A cases (95% CI 35% to 76%). Amantadine reduced duration of fever by one day (95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). Rimantadine demonstrated comparable effectiveness, but there were fewer trials and the results for prophylaxis were not statistically significant. Both amantadine and rimantadine induced significant gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. Adverse effects of the central nervous system and study withdrawals were significantly more common with amantadine than rimantadine. Neither drug affected the rate of viral shedding from the nose or the course of asymptomatic influenza.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:24:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Amantadine and rimantadine have comparable efficacy and effectiveness in relieving or treating symptoms of influenza A in healthy adults, although rimantadine induces fewer adverse effects than amantadine. The effectiveness of both drugs in interrupting transmission is probably low. Resistance of influenza viruses to amantadine is a serious worldwide problem as shown by recent virological surveillances. Both drugs have adverse gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) effects, but amantadine can also have serious effects on the nervous system. They should only be used in an emergency when all other measures fail.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:48:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The M2 ion channel blocking antiviral compounds amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine) and rimantadine hydrochloride (rimantadine) were licensed in 1976 and 1993 respectively as anti-influenza drugs in the USA. Recently the World Health Organization has encouraged member countries to use antivirals in seasonal influenza "interpandemic periods". The rationale given is as follows: "wide scale use of antivirals and vaccines during a pandemic will depend on familiarity with their effective application during the interpandemic period. The increasing use of these modalities will expand capacity and mitigate the morbidity and mortality of annual influenza epidemics. Studies conducted during the interpandemic period can refine the strategies for use during a pandemic" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). It is also likely that given their low cost amantadine and rimantadine may be used in epidemic or pandemic situations.</P>

<P>In the original review, published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>1999, issue 3, an electronic search of MEDLINE was carried out using the extended search strategy of the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group (<LINK REF="REF-ARI-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARI Group 1998</LINK>) with the following search terms or combined sets from 1966 to the end of 1997 in any language:</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:24:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We carried out assessment of methodological quality for RCTs using criteria from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We assessed studies according to randomisation, generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and follow up. We entered extracted data into Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). Aggregation of data was dependent on the sensitivity and consistency of definitions of exposure, populations and outcomes used.</P>
<P>Assessment of trial quality was made according to the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Generation of allocation schedule (defined as the methods of generation of the sequence which ensures random allocation).</LI>
<LI>Measure(s) taken to conceal treatment allocation (defined as methods to prevent selection bias, that is to say, to ensure that all participants have the same chance of being assigned to one of the arms of the trial. It protects the allocation sequence before and during allocation).</LI>
<LI>Number of drop-outs of allocated healthcare worker participants from the analysis of the trial (defined as the exclusion of any participants for whatever reason - deviation from protocol, loss to follow up, withdrawal, discovery of ineligibility, while the unbiased approach analyses all randomised participants in the originally assigned groups, regardless of compliance with protocol - known as intention-to-treat analysis).</LI>
<LI>Measures taken to implement double-blinding (a single blind study is one in which observer(s) or subjects are kept ignorant of the group to which the subjects are assigned). When both the observer and the participants are kept ignorant of assignment the trial is called double-blind. Unlike allocation concealment, double blinding seeks to prevent ascertainment bias and protects the sequence after allocation).</LI>
</OL>
<P>For criteria 2, 3 and 4 there is empirical evidence that low quality in their implementation is associated with exaggerated trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and it is reasonable to infer a quality link between all four items.</P>
<P>The four criteria were assessed by answering the following questions:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generation of allocation schedule</HEADING>
<P>Did the review author(s) use?</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random number tables.</LI>
<LI>Computer random-number generator.</LI>
<LI>Coin tossing.</LI>
<LI>Shuffling of allocation cards.</LI>
<LI>Any other method which appeared random.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Concealment of treatment allocation</HEADING>
<P>Which of the following was carried out?</P>
<OL>
<LI>There was some form of centralised randomisation scheme where details of an enrolled participant were passed to a trial office or a pharmacy to receive the treatment group allocation.</LI>
<LI>Treatment allocation was assigned by means of an on-site computer using a locked file which could be accessed only after inputting the details of the participant.</LI>
<LI>There were numbered or coded identical looking compounds which were administered sequentially to enrolled participants.</LI>
<LI>There were opaque envelopes, which had been sealed and serially numbered, utilised to assign participants to intervention(s).</LI>
<LI>A mixture of the above approaches including innovative schemes, provided the method appears impervious to allocation bias.</LI>

<P>The risk ratios (RR) of events comparing prophylaxis and placebo groups from the individual trials were combined using the DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) random-effects model to include between-trial variability. We carried out a sensitivity analysis of methods used, comparing our results obtained using the fixed-effect and random-effects models. In the prophylaxis trials efficacy was derived as 1-RR x 100 or the RR when not significant. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate association of adverse effects with exposure to antivirals. In treatment trials the choice of methods for combining the estimates of severity of influenza depended on the format in which the data were presented. We made comparisons between the mean duration of symptoms in the two groups, and methods for combining differences in means were used. Specifically, where the data were presented as the number of subjects with duration of symptoms beyond a cut-off time period these were presented as 'cases with fever at 48 hours'. The bewildering array of outcomes used in the treatment trials prevented us from using more than the 'cases with fever' outcome.</P>

<P>Two review authors (VD, TOJ) assessed allocation method, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of follow up. There were 30 trials in all, 28 of which considered either amantadine and/or rimantadine efficacy and two (<LINK REF="STD-Hayden-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hayden 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millet-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Millet 1982</LINK>) which considered adverse effects only. Twelve prophylaxis trials and seven treatment trials reported sufficient data on adverse effects. The quality of the prophylaxis trials was relatively good, considering their age. Among the 20 prophylaxis trials, 17 stated that the allocation method was randomised, although only four mentioned a particular method (<LINK REF="STD-Brady-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Monto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reuman 1989</LINK>) and two did not mention random allocation at all (<LINK REF="STD-Plesnik-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Plesnik 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schapira-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Schapira 1971</LINK>). These two trials have therefore been classified as controlled clinical trials (CCTs) rather than RCTs. All prophylaxis trials were stated to be double-blind, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Payler-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Payler 1984</LINK> which was open and had no placebo group (the comparison group was no intervention other than influenza vaccine at the beginning of the season). Among the 13 treatment trials, 11 stated that the allocation method was randomised and no trials mentioned a particular method. For Hornick's trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hornick-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Hornick 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hornick-1969b" TYPE="STUDY">Hornick 1969b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hornick-1969c" TYPE="STUDY">Hornick 1969c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hornick-1969d" TYPE="STUDY">Hornick 1969d</LINK>) there was no mention of random allocation at all.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-23 15:45:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We carried out nine comparisons:</P>
<P>Comparison A - oral amantadine compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of influenza or ILI.<BR/>Comparison B - oral rimantadine compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of influenza or ILI.<BR/>Comparison C - oral amantadine compared to oral rimantadine in the prophylaxis of influenza or ILI.<BR/>Comparison D - oral amantadine compared to placebo in the treatment of influenza.<BR/>Comparison E - oral rimantadine compared to placebo in the treatment of influenza.<BR/>Comparison F - oral amantadine compared to oral rimantadine in the treatment of influenza.<BR/>Comparison G - oral or inhaled amantadine versus placebo or aspirin in the nasal viral shedding or persistence in upper airways at two to five days.<BR/>Comparison H - oral amantadine compared to control medication in the treatment of influenza.<BR/>Comparison I - inhaled amantadine compared to placebo in the treatment of influenza.</P>
<P>For comparisons A, B and C we analysed the effects on 'cases', stratified either as influenza (a defined set of signs and symptoms backed up by serological confirmation and/or isolation of influenza virus from nasal fluids) or clinical criteria alone (ILI) or asymptomatic cases (serological confirmation and/or isolation of influenza virus from nasal fluids without symptoms). The effects on nasal viral shedding were assessed by single studies: <LINK REF="STD-Reuman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reuman 1989</LINK>(amantadine) and <LINK REF="STD-Dolin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dolin 1982</LINK> (rimantadine). We stratified comparisons on the basis of whether participants had received vaccination or not.</P>
<P>Additionally we assessed adverse effects in both comparisons.</P>
<P>In Comparisons A and B significant heterogeneity between the trial results was evident for both types of influenza analyses, so all results quoted are average treatment effects based on random-effects models. In Comparison A, amantadine prevented 61% (95% CI 35% to 76%) of influenza cases and 25% (95% CI 13% to 36%) of ILI cases. Both of these results are highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). There was no effect on asymptomatic cases (risk ratio (RR) 0.85; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.80), nor any difference in efficacy between unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74 and RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34). The effectiveness in unvaccinated subjects is significantly higher than that of placebo in unvaccinated subjects (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.52), but not in vaccinated individuals 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90).</P>
<P>In Comparison B rimantadine was not effective against either influenza (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.08) or ILI (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.20), however, analysis using a fixed-effect model shows significant protection against influenza and ILI in unvaccinated participants. Whilst these results are conventionally not statistically significant (P = 0.07 and P = 0.17, respectively), the estimates are based on only 688 individuals, and are of a very similar magnitude to those for amantadine. There was no effect on asymptomatic cases (RR 1.39; 95% CI 0.45 to 4.27), although this observation is based on one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Dolin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dolin 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Comparison C there is no evidence of a difference in efficacy between amantadine and rimantadine, although the confidence interval is quite wide (RR amantadine versus rimantadine 0.88. 95% CI 0.57 to 1.35). In comparisons B and C there were insufficient data to stratify by vaccine status of participants.</P>
<P>The 'all adverse effects' category includes all types and was derived from those trials which either did not report sufficient information to allow a more detailed classification or which presented aggregate data. Adverse effects incidence is reported in our meta-analysis as the number of participants with at least one event, thus the incidence of individual adverse effects cannot be summed to give the total with any adverse effect as more than one adverse event is likely to have taken place in the same individual during the trial.</P>
<P>In Comparison A gastrointestinal symptoms (mainly nausea, odds ratio (OR) 2.56; 95% CI 1.37 to 4.79), insomnia and hallucinations (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.50 to 4.31) and withdrawals from the trials because of adverse events (2.54; 95% CI 1.60 to 4.06) were significantly more common in participants who received amantadine than placebo. Analysis using a fixed-effect model shows a significant association with depression, insomnia and the 'all adverse events' category.</P>
<P>In Comparison B, rimantadine recipients were also more likely to experience 'all adverse effects' than placebo recipients (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.19 to 3.22). However, there was no evidence of an increase in CNS-related effects with rimantadine, and withdrawal rates were similar in both groups.</P>
<P>The direct comparison of amantadine with rimantadine (Comparison C) confirmed that CNS adverse effects and withdrawal from trials were significantly more frequent among amantadine recipients than rimantadine recipients (CNS effects, OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.67 to 5.78; withdrawals OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.26 to 4.93).</P>
<P>Thus rimantadine may be no less efficacious but safer than amantadine in preventing cases of influenza in healthy adults. Readers should bear in mind that the study sizes of the safety trials of rimantadine are considerably smaller than those of amantadine, so that the conclusions that can be drawn for rimantadine are somewhat less certain than those for amantadine.</P>
<P>We considered meta-analysing symptoms outcome data to further inform the assessment of the effects of amantadine and rimantadine in the treatment role. When we tabulated the outcome typology we discovered that such a meta-analysis would be impossible as can be seen from <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We resorted to using duration of fever (defined as a temperature greater than 37 °C) as the only common outcome. One obvious cost of this approach is the possible confounding effect of the presence of fever for a variable length of time prior to and after entry to the study (and hence at the moment of commencement of treatment). However, if random allocation had been properly carried out, this effect should disappear.</P>
<P>In Comparison D amantadine significantly shortened duration of fever compared to placebo (by 0.99 days; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26). The meta-analysis is based on 542 subjects (250 in the amantadine and 292 in the placebo arm). Where time to fever clearance data were not available (as in <LINK REF="STD-van-Voris-1981" TYPE="STUDY">van Voris 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wingfield-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Wingfield 1969</LINK>), a dichotomous outcome was used (cases with fever at 48 hours). This comparison showed that amantadine was significantly better than placebo (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66). However, there was no effect on nasal shedding or persistence of influenza A viruses in the upper airways after up to five days of treatment (RR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.24).</P>
<P>In Comparison E rimantadine shortened duration of fever compared to placebo (by 1.24 days; 95% CI -0.76 to -1.71). There were a significantly higher number of afebrile cases 48 hours after commencing rimantadine treatment (RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.53). However, there was no effect on nasal shedding or persistence of influenza A viruses in the upper airways after up to five days of treatment (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.53), although this finding may be due to the small number of observations in this comparison (152) and is sensitive to analysis using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The few data available directly comparing amantadine and rimantadine for treatment (Comparison F) showed that the efficacy of the two drugs was comparable, although the confidence intervals are very wide (for example, cases with fever at 48 hours RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.23 to 4.37).</P>
<P>In contrast to the increased adverse effect rates for prophylaxis, there was no evidence that amantadine recipients had higher adverse effect rates than placebo recipients (Comparison D), but data were only available from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kitamoto-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kitamoto 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitamoto-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Kitamoto 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Voris-1981" TYPE="STUDY">van Voris 1981</LINK> with combined denominator of 491) and the association with decreased CNS activity is sensitive to the application of a fixed-effect model. There were very few data available for the assessment of adverse effects of rimantadine for treatment (45 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Hayden-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hayden 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Voris-1981" TYPE="STUDY">van Voris 1981</LINK>) or the direct comparison between amantadine and rimantadine (33 participants in <LINK REF="STD-van-Voris-1981" TYPE="STUDY">van Voris 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>In comparison G the effects of oral or inhaled amantadine on shedding of influenza A viruses are still not significant (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19), despite meta-analysis of five studies with a combined denominator of 237 observations.</P>
<P>Readers of this review should bear in mind that the difference in incidence of adverse effects is of importance, rather than the estimated incidence itself, as the adverse effects reported with these drugs are very similar to the clinical manifestations of influenza infection.</P>
<P>Overall both drugs appear to be effective and well-tolerated, but the evaluation of the effects of rimantadine was carried out on a very small population.</P>
<P>Insufficient data were available to analyse the relationships of dose (or duration) of treatment and clinical or virological effects. However, other data suggest that equivalent doses of amantadine and rimantadine at steady-state are associated with similar plasma concentrations and similar total clearance values (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We carried out further comparisons (H and I).</P>
<P>In Comparison H, based on <LINK REF="STD-Younkin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Younkin 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ito-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ito 2000</LINK>, standard medications (aspirin and other antipyretic or anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics were equally effective compared with amantadine in reducing the length of fever (mean difference (MD) random-effects model 0.25; 95% CI - 0.37 to 0.87). This observation is based on 78 individuals and in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ito-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ito 2000</LINK> amantadine was given at the lower dose of 100 mg. Aspirin and the other antipyretic drugs appear to be as potent as amantadine in treating symptoms, however they do not inhibit viral replication and as such remain a symptomatic remedy.</P>
<P>In comparison I (based on the <LINK REF="STD-Hayden-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hayden 1980</LINK> trial) inhaled amantadine was no more efficacious than placebo in bringing down the respiratory or constitutional symptom score (MD -1.00; 95% CI -3.64 to 1.64 and -2.00; 95% CI -16.98 to 12.98, respectively). This comparison is based on small numbers of participants (20). Not surprisingly, amantadine caused significantly more nasal irritation (RR 12.50; 95% CI 1.09 to 143.43). Inhaled amantadine does not appear to be particularly effective but has a high incidence of local adverse effects, which would make compliance difficult.</P>
<P>Neither comparison showed an effect on nasal shedding or persistence of influenza A viruses in the upper airways after up to five days of treatment, although the interpretation of Comparisons H and I is made difficult by the small numbers involved and the absence of multiple trials.</P>
<P>All trials tested the effects of amantadine and rimantadine on a wide variety of influenza A viruses. None tested the effects on influenza B, on which the molecules are known to be ineffective. No trial tested the role of the compounds on workplace outbreak control, which is a pity considering the trial settings (prisons, factories, schools, barracks).</P>
<P>Some trials are likely to have included individuals who took aspirin to relieve symptoms (especially in the treatment trials). However the effects of this potential confounder should have been eliminated by the process of randomisation.</P>
<P>All trials commenced administration of the compounds within a reasonable time frame. Treatment started at the latest 48 hours after positive identification of the first case in the population and prophylaxis when the results of surveillance made it reasonable to do so.</P>
<P>No trials assessed onset of resistance, but data in one study demonstrated that 10% to 27% of patients treated with amantadine secreted drug-resistant virus within four to five days of commencing treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Separate analysis of the 11 pandemic trials did not affect our findings. Finally, we considered carrying out sub-analysis by dose (100, 200, 300 mg daily), but decided against this given the small size of the resulting meta-analysis. We will re-consider this policy if any further data become available.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-08 03:50:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The results of our review show that both amantadine and rimantadine are efficacious and relatively safe in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A symptoms. The role of amantadine in prophylaxis of symptoms (61% effective) and treatment (shortens duration of illness by one day) is beyond question and does not need to be investigated further compared to placebo. Rimantadine appears equally efficacious in prophylaxis (72%), but in direct comparison with placebo, when a random-effects model is applied, the lower bound of the 95% CI does not achieve statistical significance.</P>
<P>There are two explanations for this difference in the significance of the findings. The first is that the rimantadine result is a 'false negative'. This idea is supported by noting that its average efficacy is both large and similar to amantadine, and that there have been many fewer participants in rimantadine trials than amantadine trials (there are clinical data for approximately only 700 rimantadine compared to 2500 amantadine recipients in the review).</P>
<P>The second explanation is centred on trial heterogeneity. If a fixed-effect analysis is used (effectively ignoring the heterogeneity) then the difference between rimantadine and placebo for the prophylaxis of influenza cases is highly significant (P value less than 0.001 for both outcomes). All of the analyses of influenza outcomes demonstrated excessive variation in the results of the trials. Such a pattern has been noted in other reviews of preventive procedures, such as influenza and cholera vaccination, and may reflect differences between the trial populations to natural exposure and immunity to influenza A and other similar viruses. We have not been able to explain this heterogeneity in this systematic review.</P>
<P>Rimantadine was also seen to be equally therapeutically efficacious, shortening duration of fever by just over one day. However, again, this observation is based on 82 subjects only.</P>
<P>There is a marked difference between the two drugs in the capacity to prevent influenza and the capacity to prevent influenza-like-illness (ILI). The practical importance of this difference, which is rarely explained to the public, is that neither can be used to good effect against ILI, which is the clinical picture presenting to both the patient and the doctor. In the absence of a likely influenza diagnosis their routine use is not to be recommended. This conclusion is also supported by widespread evidence of resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine (<LINK REF="REF-Bright-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bright 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There do not appear to be significant differences in effectiveness in either role between the two compounds, although again our comparisons are based on small numbers with large confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Our conclusions must be tempered by our finding of a lack of effect of both compounds both on influenza A cases with no clinical symptoms (asymptomatic) and on viral excretion (clearance) from the upper airways (although viral concentration in nasal mucus may be reduced). Both compounds are effective in preventing or treating symptoms, but have lower effectiveness in preventing infection and probably transmission, an observation made in one of the trials included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Monto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Monto 1979</LINK>). As a consequence, it is likely that the estimates of clinical efficacy and effectiveness presented in this review are optimistic. This finding is of crucial importance in planning the use of both compounds in a situation of very high viral circulation and infectivity (such as a serious epidemic or pandemic). In addition, symptom relief may lead to convalescing subjects who are still infected and infectious increasing viral transmission in the community. On the basis of this evidence the WHO recommendations should be redrafted to include the use of amantadine and rimantadine only in emergency situations when all other measures fail.</P>
<P>The safety profile of the two drugs appears significantly different in prophylaxis, with rimantadine causing significantly fewer central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects than amantadine and fewer withdrawals from the trials. Although these observations are based on smaller numbers of rimantadine recipients, amantadine definitely causes signs of significantly increased CNS activity, an effect which is not easily acceptable by healthy adults, especially in employment which requires concentration and mental fitness. Rimantadine has a different pharmacokinetic profile from amantadine, reaching prophylactic concentration in the nasal mucus at much lower plasma concentrations than amantadine. There was a tendency for lower doses of amantadine (100 mg daily) to cause fewer adverse effects than higher doses at the cost of lower effectiveness (data not shown).</P>
<P>We conclude that from the available evidence, rimantadine appears the better choice for individual protection in emergencies.</P>
<P>In future, more attention should be paid to the assessment of adverse events of the two compounds, particularly those of rimantadine which at present are based on relatively small numbers.</P>
<P>The quality of the trials was not good with significant numbers of studies failing to give adequate descriptions of methods and of results. This may be in part due to the number of older trials in the review. Both quality of trial conducting and reporting should be improved and adverse effects and case outcome definitions should be standardised. Finally, the bewildering array of outcome definitions used in treatment studies made the task of meta-analysis difficult and led to a great loss of information.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Both drugs should be used only in emergency situations when all other measures fail. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given our findings we do not believe any further research should be carried out on these compounds.</P>

<P>In the 2004 update we included two more studies which had not been identified during the original searches (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00e1_t_x00e9_-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Máté 1970</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nafta-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Nafta 1970</LINK>) and updated text and references. We also assessed and excluded five more trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clover-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Clover 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawkins-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Dawkins 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finklea-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Finklea 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Togo-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Togo 1968</LINK>) and are awaiting translation of a further study from Polish (<LINK REF="STD-Tkaczewski-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Tkaczewski 1972</LINK>). The results and conclusions of the review do not change much. The confidence intervals around the effects of amantadine are narrower, but the findings on rimantadine are identical as both Máté and Nafta assessed the effects of amantadine.</P>
<P>The terms 'laboratory-confirmed influenza' and 'clinically confirmed influenza' have been changed for the more correct terms 'influenza' and 'influenza-like-illness' (ILI). We believe these words to reflect the difference between real influenza, caused by A and B viruses and what is colloquially known as 'the flu'. The two are rarely clinically distinguishable in real-time unless a very good surveillance apparatus is in place, as in most of the trials in our review.</P>
<P>The practical importance of this difference, which is rarely explained to the public, can be seen in the markedly different effectiveness profiles of the two drugs. Rarely can amantadine or rimantadine be used to good effect against ILI, which is what presents to both patient and doctor.</P>
<P>In the 2006 update we included one more treatment trial comparing rimantadine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Rabinovich-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinovich 1969</LINK>) and one comparing amantadine with standard treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ito-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ito 2000</LINK>) and excluded one more study, by Bricaire and colleagues. We also updated and shortened the text.</P>
<P>Because of the threat of a pandemic and on the basis of a comment made by Professor Robert B Couch we assessed the effectiveness of both compounds in preventing infection (as opposite to preventing or treating its symptoms) and in interrupting the chain of transmission (measured by the quantity and duration of viruses voided from the upper airways of infected people). We found no evidence of effectiveness of either compound. This led us to revise 'downwards' our estimates of effectiveness and warn readers that amantadine and rimantadine should be used only in emergencies. This conclusion was also based on the mounting evidence of resistance of influenza A viruses to both compounds.</P>
<P>In this April 2008 update we re-ran the searches but found no items relevant to the review. The conclusions and the text stand unaltered.</P>

<P>Prophylaxis, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial carried out in 8 engineering schools around Leningrad, in the former USSR. The design comprised an "internal" (day students) and "external" (i.e. boarders) do-nothing control group. Differential follow up is recorded between placebo and amantadine arms (30 days) and controls (12 days). The trial was carried out during the pandemic of 1968 to 1969</P>

<P>The authors conclude that amantadine was effective in preventing cases. Although randomisation occurred and concealment is described in an adequate manner, an unknown number of participants were given amantadine syrup. As no reference to syrup placebo is made in the text (only to tablet form), robustness of blinding and concealment is questionable. Additionally, the numerous discrepancies in the text make this a poorly reported trial</P>
