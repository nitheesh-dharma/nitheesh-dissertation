<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:09:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical practice is not always evidence-based and, therefore, may not optimise patient outcomes. Opinion leaders disseminating and implementing 'best evidence' is one method that holds promise as a strategy to bridge evidence-practice gaps. Opinion leaders are people who are seen as likeable, trustworthy and influential. Because of their influence, it is thought that they may be able to help and persuade healthcare providers to use evidence when treating and managing patients.</P>
<P>We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of the use of opinion leaders to disseminate and implement evidence-based medicine. We found 18 trials involving more than 296 hospitals and 318 primary care practices. Most of the included studies had some methodological shortcomings. The effects of interventions varied across the 63 outcomes from 15% decrease in compliance to 72% increase in compliance with desired practice. The median adjusted RD for the main comparisons were: i) Five trials that compared opinion leaders alone to no intervention, +0.09; ii) Two trials that compared opinion leaders alone to a single intervention, +0.14; iii) Four trials that compared opinion leaders with one or more additional intervention(s) to the one or more additional intervention(s), +0.10 and iv) Ten trials that compared opinion leaders as part of multiple interventions to no intervention, +0.10. Overall, the median adjusted RD across all studies was +0.12 representing 12% absolute increase in compliance in the intervention group.</P>
<P>In a majority of studies the sociometric method was used to identify opinion leaders, while two studies used the informant method, but due to the few studies using this method we could not conclude whether the method of identification had any impact on the effectiveness of interventions.</P>
<P>Three studies used multidisciplinary teams to promote evidence-based practice. The median adjusted RD for these trials was +0.18 representing a 18% absolute increase in compliance in the intervention group. However, two of the trials involved multiple interventions, and therefore the effectiveness of opinion leader teams could not be distinguished.</P>
<P>The results of this review show that opinion leaders may promote evidence-based practice. These results are based on heterogeneous studies using a variety of different interventions, performed in a variety of different settings, and aiming at changing a number of different outcomes. In most of the included studies the role of the opinion leader was not clearly described (educational methods used, degree or frequency of involvement of opinion leaders), and it is therefore not possible to say what is the best way to optimise the effectiveness of opinion leaders.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:10:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The translation of evidence into clinical practice is often slow, unpredictable and incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1999</LINK>). Studies have estimated that between 30 to 40% of patients do not receive treatment that accords with research evidence. Further, 20% of patients receive treatments that are proven to be detrimental (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuster 1998</LINK>).There is significant interest in devising innovative methods to promote knowledge transfer of evidence into practice and ultimately improve patient health care (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1999</LINK>), of which one is using opinion leaders to disseminate evidence-based practice.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:09:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Social Learning Theory hypothesizes that individuals perceived as 'credible', 'likeable' and 'trustworthy' are likely to be persuasive agents of behavioural change. Such 'opinion leaders' may play a key role in assisting individuals to identify the evidence underpinning best practice and to facilitate behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1976</LINK>). Opinion leadership (more properly termed Informal Opinion Leadership) is the degree to which an individual is able to influence other individuals' attitudes or overt behaviour informally, in a desired way with relative frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>). This informal leadership is not a function of the individual's formal position or status in the system; it is earned and maintained by the individual's technical competence, social accessibility, and conformity to the system's norms. When compared to their peers, opinion leaders tend to be more exposed to all forms of external communication, have somewhat higher social status, and to be more innovative. However, the most striking feature of opinion leaders is their unique and influential position in their system's communication structure; they are at the centre of interpersonal communication networks &#8211; interconnected individuals who are linked by patterned flows of information.Their use has been explored in different clinical disciplines such as surgery, obstetrics, neurology, general medicine, nursing and infection control (<LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:10:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Theoretically, opinion leaders use a range of interpersonal skills in order to achieve desired behavioural change. However, there is considerable variation in the types of educational initiatives opinion leaders use to implement best practice. Informal one to one teaching, community outreach education visits, small group teaching, academic detailing and preceptor-ships are examples of strategies used by opinion leaders for disseminating and implementing evidence-based practice (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>). Whilst opinion leaders have also used formal strategies, such as delivering didactic lectures, education delivered informally is regarded as a key ingredient in marketing and innovation diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1976</LINK>). However, it is unclear whether education delivered by opinion leaders in an informal way is more persuasive compared with formal strategies. Formalising the educational process may produce more diverse results than those in which the role of opinion leaders is allowed to be self-directed (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>). It has been suggested that opinion leaders may be less influential when their role is formalised through mail-outs, workshops or teaching rounds (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>). Research also suggest that the setting of an opinion leader intervention may be important for its success i.e. that opinion leader interventions in secondary care may be more effective than in primary care, due to more complex social networks in the former (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2006a</LINK>). It has also been proposed that different opinion leaders may be needed for different (clinical) issues (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the process by which opinion leaders are selected affects the success or otherwise of their educational initiatives. Methods used to identify opinion leaders can be broadly classified into four categories: the observation method, the self-designating method, the informant method and the sociometric method (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>) though this list of methods has recently been expanded (<LINK REF="REF-Valente-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valente 2007</LINK>).The observation method employs an independent observer to identify opinion leaders amongst a group of professionals interacting with one another in a work context. The self-designating method requires that members of a professional network report their own perceptions of their role as an opinion leader. The informant method relies on asking individuals to identify those individuals who act as principle sources of influence. Via a standardised, self-reported questionnaire, the sociometric method asks members of a network to judge individuals according to the extent to which they are educational influential, knowledgeable and humanistic. Methods used to select opinion leaders have not been consistent across studies. Moreover, different methods result in different individuals being identified as opinion leaders (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2006a</LINK>). The question of whether any one method is more likely to identify opinion leaders that are more effective in promoting knowledge transfer remains open to empirical assessment.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:10:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to improve patient outcomes and decrease inappropriate or potentially harmful patient treatments it is important to speed up and optimise the process of translating evidence-based research into practice. One way of doing this may be through the use of local opinion leaders. Several aspects of opinion leader interventions need further investigation, to be able to advise on their best use. We report an update of the previous Cochrane review to determine the effectiveness of the use of opinion leaders targeted at changing the behaviours of professionals and improving the healthcare outcomes of their patients. Our updated review uses revised methods of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group to systematically assess the risk of bias of included studies (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2009</LINK>) and extends the earlier review by Doumit et al.(<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2007</LINK>) by aiming to investigate if the success of an intervention depends on if it was delivered by a single opinion leader or a multidisciplinary opinion leader team.</P>

In addition; The Cochrane Library and the Cochrane Effective Practce and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Trials Register were searched by EPOC's Trials Search Co-ordinator (Jessie McGowan) for additional studies. The contents lists of several key journals were also scanned (Medical Care; BMJ; JAMA, Lancet; Annals of Internal Medicine). The first author also read through reference lists of included trials to identify any additional studies.</P>
<P>For the present version of the review:</P>
<P>See: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group methods used in reviews.</P>
<P>We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies  </HEADING>
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of the use of local opinion leaders in improving the behaviour/practice of healthcare professionals and/or patients outcomes. Two review authors (GF and ME) screened the titles and abstracts found by the electronic search. All citations that appeared to evaluate opinion leaders in randomised controlled trials were retrieved. Where there was any doubt about a study's eligibility, the other review authors (from GD, MG and MO) assessed each study for eligibility independently and resolved discrepancies via discussion. Any study identified as potentially eligible after reviewing its title and abstract but subsequently excluded is documented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and management  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (from GF, ME, EP, GD, MG and MO) extracted data into a modified data extraction form (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Data were reconciled and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We contacted authors of included studies for additional information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>We used The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) on six standard criteria: adequate sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinded or objective assessment of primary outcome(s), adequately addressed incomplete outcome data, free from selective reporting, free of other risk of bias. We used three additional criteria specified by EPOC (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2009</LINK>): similar baseline characteristics, similar baseline outcome measures, adequate protection against contamination.</P>
<P>Studies achieved a 'low' risk of bias score if all risk of bias criteria were judged as 'adequate'. A score of moderate or high risk of bias was assigned to studies that scored inadequate on 'one to two' or 'more than two' criteria, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>). Studies that used cluster randomisation scored adequate on protection against contamination and on concealment of allocation (if the sequence generation was adequate). No studies were excluded because of poor methodological quality. We compared results between studies considered as having low risk of bias with studies judged to be at ' either moderate or high' risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We calculated the adjusted risk differences (RD) for primary (dichotomous) outcomes, and expressed all outcomes as compliance with desired practice. An adjusted risk difference is the difference between intervention and control group means of compliance after (post) the intervention minus the difference between groups before (pre) the intervention which may be expressed as:</P>
<P>Adjusted risk difference (RD) = [risk of compliance (intervention - control) post-intervention] - [risk of compliance (intervention - control) pre-intervention]</P>
<P>A positive adjusted RD indicates that compliance improved more in the opinion leader intervention group that in the control group. Therefore a positive adjusted RD (e.g. of +0.12) indicates an absolute improvement in compliance with desired practice (of 12%) whilst a negative adjusted RD represents a decrease.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we report means and standard deviations in tables and in the text, but this data was not included in the primary analyses. When necessary, results were approximated from graphical representations of results.</P>
<P>If a (objective) primary outcome measure was specified by the authors, we reported the adjusted risk differences for that outcome measure. If a primary outcome measure was not specified by the authors, we calculated adjusted risk differences for each (objective) outcome measure reported in a study and extracted the median value across outcomes. In the result tables, we tabulated the median adjusted risk difference for studies that reported an odd number of primary outcomes. For studies that reported an even number of outcomes we averaged the risk difference for the two middlemost to produce the median study adjusted RD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>Analyses of studies using cluster randomisation that do not account for the design effect risk inflating the type 1 error-rate and result in artificially narrow confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). Therefore, we do not report P-values or confidence intervals for cluster randomised trials not accounting for the design effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Since no single estimate of effect could be found between trials and meta-analyses were not feasible, we made no statistical assessment of heterogeneity.</P>

<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> shows the study flow chart (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). A total of 595 non-duplicate citations were identified from electronic database searches. Reference lists and expert contacts yielded one additional citation. After screening all titles and abstracts of retrieved studies, 24 studies met the initial selection criteria and were obtained for full text review. Of these 24 studies,18 studies were excluded for different reasons, which are presented in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. The remaining six studies which met our inclusion criteria are reported in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table together with the 12 trials previously described and analysed by Doumit et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2006</LINK>). A total of 18 trials are thus included in the present review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of setting and professionals</HEADING>
<P>Ten trials were based in the United States, six in Canada, one in China (Hong Kong), and one in Argentina and Uruguay. Fourteen of the 18 trials evaluated interventions delivered in hospitals, one described an intervention delivered in primary care practices (McAlister et al 2008). In one study the intervention was delivered in both primary and secondary care (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1997</LINK>). In two studies the setting was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physicians were targeted in 14 trials, nurses in two trials and two trials targeted physicians, nurses and midwives. In all trials the opinion leaders delivered educational initiatives to members of their own healthcare profession.</P>
<P>In 14 trials, opinion leaders were identified using the sociometric method in which healthcare professionals were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire to identify educationally influential colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1995</LINK>). All fourteen trials reported using a version of a questionnaire developed by Hiss and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Hiss-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiss 1978</LINK>). Response rates identifying opinion leaders via the sociometric questionnaire were reported for seven studies and varied between 30% to 67%. Two trials identified opinion leaders using the informant method (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 1990</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Leviton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leviton 1999</LINK>). The two remaining trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sisk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sisk 2004</LINK>) described two methods of identification, In <LINK REF="STD-Sisk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sisk 2004</LINK> the informant method and the sociometric method were used (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1966</LINK>), and in <LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK> the informant and the self designating method were used.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of intervention</HEADING>
<P>The use of a local opinion leader was the only intervention in five trials. In thirteen trials, local opinion leaders were supplemented by other interventions such as audit and feedback, chart reminders, faxed evidence summaries, educational materials, seminars and lectures.</P>
<P>Intervention duration ranged from one week (<LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>) up to 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Althabe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Althabe 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The frequency of opinion leader involvement was clearly described in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sisk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sisk 2004</LINK>), and two more attempted a description (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lomas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lomas 1991</LINK>), but in most studies no description was provided.</P>
<P>In seven studies teams of opinion leaders were used (<LINK REF="STD-Althabe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Althabe 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leviton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leviton 1999</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>), of which five were multidisciplinary (<LINK REF="STD-Althabe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Althabe 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leviton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leviton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stross and colleagues published three trials comparing the effect of local opinion leaders with a no intervention control group. In the first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stross-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Stross 1980</LINK>), that aimed to improve management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the opinion leaders disseminated their knowledge via informal contact with colleagues as well as formal talks. In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Stross 1983</LINK>), that aimed to improve the care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), half of the contacts between opinion leaders and their colleagues were informal and half were formal. The opinion leaders had significant contact with community's primary care physicians (69%) during the study period. The third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stross-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Stross 1985</LINK>), that aimed to improve care delivered to patients with osteoarthritis, did not describe the educational activities of the opinion leaders.</P>
<P>Hong et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 1990</LINK>) assessed the effectiveness of two interventions involving opinion leaders, both aimed to increase correct urinary catheter practices. The first consisted of an opinion leader only intervention. Opinion leader activities were mainly centred on conducting tutorials on their own nursing ward. The second group received an in-service 30 minute lecture delivered by an infection control nurse, and in addition to the demonstration tutorials delivered by opinion leaders. The trial included a group of clinicians randomised to receiving the in-service lecture only.</P>
<P>Lomas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lomas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lomas 1991</LINK>) randomised clinicians to one of three groups. One group of clinicians received an opinion leader intervention together with written educational materials. Opinion leaders were involved in informal and formal educational sessions, sending out educational materials and hosting a community meeting with recognised experts in obstetric medicine, with the aim of increasing rates of trial of labour and vaginal birth in women with previous caesarean section. The second group of clinicians were randomised to receive audit and feedback about hospital rates regarding different modes of labour delivery. The third group of clinicians received standard dissemination.</P>
<P>Hodnett and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 1996</LINK>) used local opinion leaders to promote better care for women in labour and thereby to decrease the rate of epidural anaesthesia, but did not report their activities. The control group received standard dissemination.</P>
<P>In the trial by Elliott and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1997</LINK>), which aimed to improve cancer pain management, opinion leaders were involved in community based task forces, didactic programs and outreach activities. Televised community programs were also held in two of the three communities studied. The control group was standard dissemination.</P>
<P>Soumerai et al (<LINK REF="STD-Soumerai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soumerai 1998</LINK>) randomised clinicians to receive an opinion leader intervention or audit and feedback of in-hospital drug usage. The authors reported that their opinion leader intervention was combined with the dissemination of educational materials. The opinion leaders worked with small groups of colleagues via informal and formal consultations to improve care for patients post acute myocardial infarction (i.e. correct medication). In addition, they worked to institute system changes through implementing protocols.</P>
<P>Leviton et al (<LINK REF="STD-Leviton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leviton 1999</LINK>) used an opinion leader, chart reminder system and feedback to convey their recommendation of antenatal corticosteroid use for foetal maturation. The local opinion leaders in the trial were involved mainly in informal activities such as group discussions. The intervention group was compared with a standard dissemination control group.</P>
<P>Guadagnoli et al (<LINK REF="STD-Guadagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guadagnoli 2000</LINK>) reported that the intervention group received a performance feedback report and were educated by an opinion leader. The opinion leader conducted mainly slide presentations at grand rounds and disseminated educational material to persuade surgeons to discuss treatment options with women with breast cancer prior to surgery. The control group received the performance feedback report.</P>
<P>Two intervention groups were reported in the trial by Berner et al (<LINK REF="STD-Berner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Berner 2003</LINK>): (i) traditional health care quality improvement program (HCQIP) based mainly on hospital specific feedback data and (ii) local opinion leaders in addition to the HCQIP program. In this trial, the educational activities of the opinion leaders were not clearly reported. However, the authors stated that the opinion leaders received standardised educational materials (PowerPoint presentations, guidelines) and feedback data to help them educate their colleagues and to persuade them to adhere to unstable angina guidelines. A standard dissemination control group was included in this study.</P>
<P>In a study by Sisk et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sisk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sisk 2004</LINK>), hospitals were randomised to receive standard dissemination or an opinion leader-led intervention to improve breast feeding rates. Opinion leaders engaged in formal educational activities and utilised feedback data on their hospital rates of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>Cabana et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>) randomised providers to either receive an opinion leader-led intervention or standard care, and patients to receive care by an intervention doctor or standard care. The intervention group received two opinion leader-led interactive seminar sessions (2.5 hours each) that reviewed national asthma guidelines, communication skills, and key educational asthma messages to improve asthma care. Teams of three opinion leaders (one primary care paediatrician, one paediatric sub specialist and one behavioural scientist/ health educator) delivered the intervention.</P>
<P>In Majumdar et al (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>) physicians were randomised to either receive the opinion leader intervention or no intervention. An opinion leader team, consisting of five physicians specialising in HF and/or IHD, worked with the investigators to develop the evidence summaries. Opinion leaders signed a one page patient specific evidence summary that was faxed to the patient&#8217;s physician together with the patient&#8217;s most recent medication profile, to improve prescribing for patients with HF and /or IHD. In the comparison group the physician received only the patient&#8217;s most recent medication profile.</P>
<P>In a study by Althabe et al (<LINK REF="STD-Althabe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Althabe 2008</LINK>) hospitals were randomised to receive standard care or an opinion leader led multifaceted behavioural intervention which included interactive workshops, training of manual skills, one-on-one academic detailing visits, reminders, and feedback, to implement guidelines for the use of episiotomy and management of the third stage of labour. Teams of three to six birth attendants (physicians, residents, or midwifes) delivered the intervention at each intervention hospital.</P>
<P>In another study by Majumdar et al (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>) patients were randomised to receive a multifaceted intervention including opinion leaders, aimed at improving the quality of osteoporosis care for older patients with wrist fractures, or to receive no active intervention. Teams, that consisted of five local opinion leaders, developed (and signed) the guidelines together with the investigators. The intervention consisted of three components: i) brief telephone based counselling delivered by a nurse to patients, ii) a patient specific reminder was sent to each physician of an intervention patient, and iii) evidence-based treatment guidelines, endorsed by opinion leaders sent by fax or mail to the patient&#8217;s physician. Patients in the control group were sent only printed educational material.  Physicians of control patients were routinely notified that their patients had been treated for a wrist fracture in the emergency department and were informed about follow-up plans and appointments.</P>
<P>In a study by Wright et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2008</LINK>) hospitals were randomised to receive either (i) a standardized lecture delivered by an expert opinion leader in colon cancer, academic detailing of a local opinion leader by the expert opinion leader, a toolkit and a follow-up reminder package to be used by the local opinion leader or (ii) only the standardised lecture. One local opinion leader was identified among hospital surgeons and pathologists at each intervention hospital. One regional expert opinion leader was identified, who visited all, but one, of the local opinion leaders at the intervention hospitals.</P>
<P>Two intervention groups were reported in the trial by McAlister et al (<LINK REF="STD-McAlister-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 2009</LINK>) which aimed to improve the use of statins (new start or dose increase) six months post-cardiac catheterization. The interventions were: (i) an opinion leader signed statement (with a summary of evidence with explicit treatment advice about secondary prevention of coronary artery disease), plus a cardiac catheterisation result diagram faxed to the primary care physicians (PCP) of adults with coronary heart disease at the time of elective cardiac catheterization and (ii) an unsigned statement plus a cardiac catheterisation result diagram were faxed to the PCP. PCPs in the control group were faxed only their patient&#8217;s cardiac catheterisation result diagram.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:45:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opinion leaders alone or in combination with other interventions may successfully promote evidence-based practice, but the effectiveness varies both within and between studies. Eighteen randomised controlled trials (providing 18 comparisons) that evaluated the effectiveness of opinion leaders to disseminate and implement evidence-based medicine were included in this review. Most of the studies had methodological shortcomings indicating a risk of bias. Overall, the median absolute improvement in performance associated with the opinion leader intervention across all usable trials taken together was 12%. All four pre-specified comparisons produced positive effects. Five trials that compared opinion leaders alone to a no intervention control group reported a median adjusted RD +0.09; two trials that compared the use of opinion leaders to a single intervention produced a median adjusted RD +0.14; four trials of opinion leaders combined with one or more intervention(s) compared to the same one or more intervention(s)produced a median adjusted RD +0.10; and 10 trials that included comparisons of opinion leaders as part of multifaceted interventions compared with no intervention produced a median adjusted RD +0.10.</P>
<P>In the last of our comparisons (opinion leaders combined with one or more intervention(s) compared, to the same one or more intervention(s)) the interventions varied greatly in content and (probably) also to the degree that opinion leadership contributed to the intervention.  Though we did not pre-specify it the best estimate of the effect of opinion leaders alone comes from the studies in comparison 1 (opinion leaders alone compared to a no intervention control) and comparison 3 (opinion leaders combined with one or more intervention(s) compared to the same one or more intervention(s)). Across these nine trials the median adjusted RD was +0.10 indicating a 10% improvement in desired practice.</P>
<P>The effect across 14 trials employing the sociometric method varied from -0.15 to +0.72, with a median adjusted RD of +0.1. The median RD of the two trials that used the informant method was +0.15. Our simple comparison suggest that both methods are capable of achieving the same order of effect size but it was not possible to assess the relative superiority of one or other method given the small number of trials available.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:46:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought to identify variables associated with the effectiveness of opinion leaders. We hypothesised that informal methods of delivering education would be more conducive to successful dissemination of new innovations. However, we found that most studies lacked the necessary information to reliably categorise them according to the educational method used by the local opinion leaders. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to confirm that formalisation of the opinion leaders role can diminish the influence of opinion leaders as suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>. We were also interested in investigating whether or not the frequency of involvement of opinion leaders would affect the effectiveness of intervention, but again, too little detail was reported in the papers to make comparisons feasible.</P>
<P>Another factor that may affect the effectiveness of intervention is the 'intensity' of involvement of opinion leaders. Overall, it was very difficult to quantify this. In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McAlister-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 2009</LINK>) the intensity of the opinion leader intervention was very low, in that opinion leaders only signed patient specific evidence summaries that were faxed to the patients physician. No significant effect of the intervention was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McAlister-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McAlister 2009</LINK>, while in <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK> a significant difference between intervention and control groups was reported. However, this was a multifaceted intervention also involving patient education and reminders, which may explain the significant effect of intervention found in this study. This trial is a good example of a more general problem with the studies included in comparison 4 (opinion leaders combined with one or more intervention(s) compared, to the same one or more intervention(s)) - that it is impossible to separate out the effects of the opinion leader component of an intervention from the rest of a multifaceted intervention. If the aim is to better understand the effectiveness of opinion leaders then one solution to this problem, as been suggested by Doumit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2006</LINK>), is to use 'gold standard' experiments i.e. trials that compare interventions that are identical across experimental arms except for the use of opinion leader. However, this would necessitate the inclusion of an additional trial arm with the added cost and complexity that would entail.</P>
<P>The sociometric method was the most common method for identifying opinion leaders. Most commonly, this method involved the distribution of a self-reported questionnaire to members of a professional group. The questionnaire asks respondents to rate individuals according to the extent to which they are educational influential, knowledgeable and humanistic. However, the sociometric method may be prone to incomplete identification of opinion leaders within a community if only a select number of those asked to identify opinion leaders respond. For example, in the 14 trials which used the sociometric method, responses to surveys ranged from between 30% to 67%. It is therefore unclear whether the opinion leaders identified in studies with such response rates had the potential to influence non responding study participants.</P>
<P>In the studies included in this review no patient outcomes were reported. Although changing health care professional behaviour to increase the use of effective clinical practices should translate into improvements in patient outcomes we did not find any studies that reported these. However, even if they did so, because of lower event rates it would be unlikely that studies would be able to be powered to detect important differences.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:46:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 18 cluster randomised controlled trials. Sixteen of the included studies were judged to have a 'high' or 'moderate' risk of bias, and two studies to have a 'low' risk of bias.</P>
<P>In seven (or five) studies the results were not appropriately analysed at the cluster level or by considering the intra-cluster correlation when the analysis was conducted using data from individual patients.</P>
<P>The results of this systematic review have other important limitations. The activities of the opinion leaders were not clearly described in most trials and few trials specified the frequency of the activities that were conducted. While we demonstrated an overall positive effect of opinion leaders, the results varied across trials and also within trials where multiple outcomes were assessed. This heterogeneity may be due to factors such as the differences in outcomes and how they were measured, differing types of clinicians and differing clinical condition studied.</P>
<P>Further issues relating to identifying and using opinion leaders relate to the stability of the identification of opinion leaders and the clinical spread of their influence. The issue of the identification of opinion leaders has been complicated by the discovery that individual local opinion leaders identified by sociometric method pioneered by Hiss do not seem to be reliably identified across time (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2006</LINK>). Only 8% and 18% of local opinion leaders identified by pathologists and general surgeons respectively were re-identified after a two years period. Furthermore, it has also been shown that local opinion leaders identified by employing Hiss's instrument tended to be disease specific (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2006a</LINK>). Overall, these findings indicate that it is often difficult to reliably define and identify opinion leaders.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that different 'opinion leaders' will be required to effect change on clinical outcomes. In four of the newly included studies multidisciplinary opinion leader teams were used to promote evidence practice (<LINK REF="STD-Althabe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Althabe 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabana-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabana 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>). The median adjusted RD for the three trials reporting dichotomous outcomes was +0.18 representing 18% absolute increase in compliance with desired practice for the opinion leader intervention. But since two of the trials involved multiple interventions the effectiveness of the opinion leader teams are difficult to distinguish.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:47:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this, as well as in the previous review, only interventions that had used one of four named methods for identification of opinion leaders were included. However, if other methods of identification based on 'position' or by 'judges ratings' (methods that <LINK REF="REF-Valente-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valente 2007</LINK> report are commonly used) were included then a larger number of trials may have been found. All references found by the electronic search were sifted and data-extracted by two review authors independently. Only RCTs were included in the review as they generally provide the strongest level of evidence of causation available (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process. Although a comprehensive search was performed (including a search of grey literature), the possibility of having missed relevant studies cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>In addition, there is the possible risk of publication bias, which constitutes another threat to the conclusions of this review. Studies reporting a beneficial effect of the intervention or a larger effect size may be published, while similar amount of data pointing in the other direction may remain unpublished (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2009</LINK>). We were unable to assess publication bias in this review because of the heterogeneity of the interventions assessed.</P>

<P>In a previous Cochrane systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of opinion leaders in promoting knowledge transfer by Doumit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2007</LINK>) the authors concluded that " the use of opinion leaders can successfully promote evidence-based practice". The present review, which includes an additional six trials, reports a 12% increase in compliance due to the opinion leader intervention, further supports this finding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-06 07:48:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opinion leader interventions appear to improve performance. The effectiveness of opinion leaders as a strategy appears comparable to other strategies used to disseminate and implement evidence-based practice in health care. When compared with findings from a systematic review of implementation strategies, our results demonstrate that opinion leaders appear comparable to the distribution of educational materials, audit and feedback, multifaceted interventions involving educational outreach in increasing compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2006b</LINK>). Also two more recent Cochrane systematic reviews show results comparable to ours for audit and feedback (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>) and educational outreach visits (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2008</LINK>). However, identifying opinion leaders can be labour intensive, and issues regarding the reliability and validity of identifying option leaders (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2006</LINK>) might limit the wider use of opinion leaders as a knowledge transfer intervention. Further, the cost and cost effectiveness of this type of interventions are unknown.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-14 05:41:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Gerd M Flodgren">
<P>Future studies should ensure that a detailed description of the intervention is provided e.g. the actual activity and delivery of education by the opinion leader (what they do, how they do it , and how frequently they do it), the method of identification of the opinion leader, etc. This would allow for replication across studies and contexts. Future work on the methods of identifying opinion leaders and the stability of identified leaders over time would usefully inform decisions on how best to identify opinion leaders.</P>
<P>Further research could also be directed towards identifying the context in which opinion leaders are most effective. Most studies located for this review were conducted in hospital centres (secondary care), and it is unclear whether these findings will generalise to other settings.</P>
<P>A general improvement in the methods used in trials examining the effectiveness of opinion leaders should be encouraged.</P>
<P>More trials comparing interventions that are identical across experimental arms except for the use of opinion leaders would represent the 'gold standard' experiment with which to better test the effectiveness of opinion leaders as a strategy for implementation of best practice.</P>
