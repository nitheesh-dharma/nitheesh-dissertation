<P>Exercise is used by many people living with HIV to improve fitness, well-being, and body image. Exercise also is used as a strategy to diminish the health-related consequences of HIV and associated treatments. This review of 14 trials found that performing constant or interval aerobic exercise, or a combination of constant aerobic exercise and progressive resistive exercise, for at least 20 minutes, three times per week for at least five weeks appears to be safe and may be able to improve fitness, body composition, and well-being for adults living with HIV. More high-quality studies are needed to better evaluate the evidence on under-represented groups, such as women and older adults living with HIV, and those who discontinue their exercise programs.</P>

<P>A total of 14 studies met inclusion criteria for this review and 30 meta-analyses over several updates were performed. Main results indicated that performing constant or interval aerobic exercise, or a combination of constant aerobic exercise and progressive resistive exercise for at least 20 minutes at least three times per week for at least five weeks appears to be safe and may lead to significant improvements in selected outcomes of cardiopulmonary fitness (maximum oxygen consumption), body composition (leg muscle area, percent body fat), and psychological status (depression-dejection symptoms).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-07 10:55:28 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The profile of HIV infection has changed over time. Although HIV infection once was viewed as an illness progressing in a predictable way toward death, access to combination antiretroviral therapy has turned it into a chronic and manageable disease for many. This increased chronicity has been mirrored by increased prevalence of disablement among people living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Rusch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rusch 2004</LINK>), such as impairments (problems with body function or structure, such as pain or fatigue), activity limitations (difficulties in executing activities, such as inability to walk) and participation restrictions (problems in life situations, such as inability to work) due to HIV, its sequelae, and potential side effects of combination antiretroviral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2001</LINK>). Exercise is a key strategy employed by people living with HIV and by rehabilitation professionals to address these issues.</P>
<P>Exercise has been shown to improve strength, cardiovascular function, and psychological status in general populations (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1993</LINK>), but knowledge about the benefits and risks of exercise for adults living with HIV is still emerging. What are the appropriate parameters for frequency, intensity, duration, and type of exercise? At which stage of HIV infection will exercise be most beneficial, least beneficial, or even harmful? What is the spectrum of outcomes that may result from exercise in this population?</P>
<P>If the risks and benefits of exercise for people living with HIV are better understood, appropriate exercise may be undertaken by people in this population and appropriate exercise prescription may be practiced by healthcare providers. Effective and safe exercise may enhance the effectiveness of HIV management, thus improving overall health outcomes for adults living with HIV.</P>

<P>We included studies of adults (18 years of age and older) living with HIV. Studies of men only, women only, or both at all stages of infection, with and without lipodystrophy, were included. Although the title of the review refers to "adults living with HIV/AIDS" as the target population, we used the terminology "adults living with HIV" in this update to collectively represent any adult living with HIV at any stage of illness (including AIDS). This terminology increasingly is preferred because AIDS has become less common among people living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Managing-Your-Health-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Managing Your Health 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We defined aerobic exercise as a regimen containing aerobic interventions performed at least three times per week for at least four weeks. Aerobic interventions included but were not limited to walking, jogging, cycling, rowing, stair stepping, and swimming. Interventions may or may not have been supervised. Our parameters for aerobic exercise inclusion were based on the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-American-College-of-Sports-Medicine-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">American College of Sports Medicine 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1998</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-07-07 15:25:50 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>During the original planning of this review, we met with experts, such as physical therapists, physicians, and methodologists, and people living with HIV. Our discussions concluded that the three best outcome parameters for this review were immunologic and virologic indicators, cardiopulmonary measures and psychologic measures. In this most recent update, we expanded our outcomes to include strength, weight, and body composition, which have become increasingly important with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of lipodystrophy. The recent literature has increasingly considered these outcomes when evaluating the combination of aerobic and resistive exercise.</P>
<P>Immunologic and virologic indicators considered in this review included but were not limited to CD4 count (cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>) and viral load (log<SUB>10</SUB>copies).</P>
<P>Cardiopulmonary measures considered in this review included but were not limited to maximal oxygen consumption (V02max) (mL/kg/min), oxygen pulse (02pulse), maximum heart rate (HRmax, beats/min), maximum tidal volume (maxTv), forced expiratory volume (FEV), minute ventilation (VE), lactic acid threshold (LAT), maximum work rate (Work Rate Max), fatigue (time on treadmill), and dyspnea (rate of perceived exertion).</P>
<P>Strength measures considered for this review included but were not limited to strength (maximum amount of weight able to resist in kilograms).</P>
<P>Weight measures considered for this review included but were not limited to change in body weight (kg).</P>
<P>Body composition measures considered for this review included but were not limited to body mass index (kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>), lean body mass (kg), girth (cm), percent body fat (%), skin folds (subcutaneous fat), and cross-sectional muscle area (mm<SUP>2</SUP>). For the purpose of this review, we defined body composition broadly as any outcome that contributes to the direct or indirect measurement of muscle, fat, bone, or other tissues of the body.</P>
<P>Psychological measures considered in this review included general measures of psychological status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) used in studies with people living with HIV. These included but were not limited to the Montgomery-Asberg Scale for Depression, General Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Questionnaire, SF-20, Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV), Short Form 36 (SF-36), Short Form 12 (SF-12), Short Form 21 (SF-21), Quality of Well-Being Scale, Q-TWIST, Quality of Life Index, EuroQol questionnaire, Sickness Impact Profile, Profile of Mood State Scale (POMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and health utility assessment.</P>
<P>Safety measures considered in this review included but were not limited to injuries, immune suppression (decline in CD4 count), hospitalizations, and mortality.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-07-07 15:11:48 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>In our three updates of this review, we searched the following databases from 1980 - June 2009: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCIENCE CITATION INDEX, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, PsycINFO and SPORTDISCUS. We reviewed both published and unpublished abstracts and proceedings from major international and national HIV/AIDS conferences, such as the Intersciences Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the Infectious Diseases Society of America Conference (IDSA), and the International AIDS Conference (IAC). Reference lists from pertinent articles and books were reviewed and personal contacts with authors were also used, as well as CochraneReview Group databases. Targeted journals were also handsearched for relevant articles. All languages were included.</P>
<P>Three arms of the search strategy were developed and intersected using the Boolean term 'AND':<BR/>i) HIV subject headings (exploded): HIV, HIV Infections, HIV long term survivors<BR/>Text words: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, aids, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.<BR/>ii) Exercise subject headings (exploded): exercise, exertion, physical fitness, sports, physical education, aerobic exercises, cycling, walking, aerobics, Tae-Bo, water aerobics, running, and training<BR/>Text words: aerobic, exercise<BR/>iii) Study search criteria subject headings: randomised controlled trials, random allocation, double-blind method, single blind method, clinical trials (explode), placebos, research design, comparative study, evaluation studies (explode), follow-up studies, prospective studies, cross-over studies, intervention studies.<BR/>Publication types: randomised controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, clinical trial.<BR/>Text words: (clinic- trial-), ((singl- or doubl- or tripl- or trebl) adj (mask- or blind-)), placebo-, random-, latin square, control-, prospectiv-, volunteer-. For some of the databases and updates, slight modification of this strategy was required.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-07-07 13:52:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All abstracts retrieved from the search were reviewed independently by two reviewers (KO and AMT) who applied the following four inclusion criteria to determine if the abstract warranted further investigation:</P>
<P>a) Did the study include human participants who were HIV positive?<BR/>b) Did the study include adults 18 years of age or older?<BR/>c) Did the study include an aerobic exercise intervention performed at least three times/week for at least four weeks?<BR/>d) Was there a randomised controlled comparison group?</P>
<P>When the review based on the abstract alone (or title and keywords if no abstract was available from the electronic search) indicated that one or both raters believed the study met eligibility criteria (i.e. if reviewers answered "yes" or "unsure" to the four questions) then hard copies of entire papers were independently reviewed by the two reviewers. In instances where there was a lack of agreement by the two reviewers, a third reviewer was asked to review the full paper to determine final inclusion. Full text was not examined in instances where both raters agreed the study did not meet the inclusion criteria. From the final group of studies that met inclusion criteria, at least two reviewers reviewed each article independently to determine final article inclusion.</P>
<P>From the final group of included studies, data were abstracted onto standard data abstraction forms independently by at least two reviewers (KO and AMT). Abstracted data included the study citation, study objectives, study design, length of study, time at which participants were assessed, inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, characteristics of included participants (i.e. age, gender, stage of disease), description of intervention(s) (i.e. frequency, intensity, duration, type, level of supervision), types of outcome variables assessed and their values at baseline and study completion, and number of participants at baseline and study completion (including number of withdrawals). Methodological quality of the studies was also abstracted using criteria suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, along with whether groups were similar at baseline. Instead of generating a formal methodological score, reviewers provided a description of the methodological quality of the studies as follows:</P>
<P>a) Was the study described as randomised? If yes, describe the method of randomization.<BR/>b) Was the study described as double-blinded? If yes, describe how double-blinding was obtained.<BR/>c) Was there a description of withdrawals or drop-outs?<BR/>d) Were the groups similar at baseline?</P>
<P>The reviewers met to achieve consensus regarding any difference in data interpretation or abstraction from included studies that arose during the review process.</P>
<P>Outcomes were analyzed both as continuous outcomes and as dichotomous/binary outcomes whenever possible. Where there were sufficient data available in the studies, when similar or comparable outcome measures were used, and when participant comparison groups were similar, meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model for outcomes whenever possible. In the case of missing data, authors were contacted in an attempt to obtain further information when required.</P>
<P>Standard statistical techniques included:<BR/>(1) For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals for the means were calculated whenever possible.<BR/>(2) For dichotomous/binary outcomes the odds ratio, absolute difference in odds, relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), and the number needed to treat (NNT) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated whenever possible.</P>
<P>A <I>P </I>value of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance for overall effect and a <I>P </I>value of less than 0.1 indicated statistical significance for heterogeneity between studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>). In instances of lack of statistical significance for an overall effect, confidence intervals were assessed for potential trends that may suggest movement towards an increase or decrease in overall effect. In instances of statistical significance for heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity analyses and explained potential reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses were performed whenever possible to estimate whether aerobic exercise interventions were associated with differences among groups using identified outcome measures. Possible subgroup analyses included supervised versus non-supervised exercise, interval versus constant exercise, males versus females, older versus younger participants, participants with HIV wasting versus participants without HIV wasting, and participants on antiretroviral therapy versus participants not on antiretroviral therapy.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine whether particular studies skewed results. In situations where outliers were omitted or inclusion criteria for studies varied, sensitivity analyses were performed as needed to determine the robustness of findings. Exploratory analyses were performed based on the results of the review. Individual study design and procedures were taken into account to determine whether biases manifested. Potential biases in studies may have included selection bias (systematic differences in the comparison groups), performance bias (systematic differences in the care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated), exclusion bias (systematic differences in withdrawals from the trial), and detection bias (systematic differences in outcome assessment). Reviewers also assessed whether or not an "intention-to-treat" analysis was performed for participants lost to follow-up.</P>

<P>For this third update, the literature search from September 2003 to June 2009 retrieved a total of 1611 citations, 49 of which were judged to merit scrutiny of the full article. Of the 49<B> </B>studies reviewed, six met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK> and 2004b, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> and 2008b) for this review.

In these instances, earlier published studies were included in the review, and any additional outcomes reported in the later studies were incorporated into the review (see table of characteristics of duplicate studies).Thus, a total of 14 studies were included in this overall systematic review update.<BR/>
<BR/>Studies excluded were review articles, letters, or editorials which therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria. Other studies were excluded because they did not include aerobic exercise interventions, did not include a comparison group, or, as mentioned above, were duplications of previously published studies (see table of characteristics of excluded studies).</P>
<P>
<B>DESIGN OF INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>
</B>All 14 included studies were randomised controlled trials. Nine studies included a non-exercising control group <LINK REF="STD-LaPerriere--1990" TYPE="STUDY">LaPerriere 1990</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). One of the studies included two additional study groups: exercise plus injection of 200 mg of testosterone enanthate per week, and a testosterone-only group (<LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>). These two comparison groups were not included in the analysis for this review. One study included a non-exercising counselling group (exercise vs. counselling group) (<LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>); one study included a progressive resistive exercise (PRE) group (<LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1996</LINK>); one study compared combined aerobic exercise and low lipid diet with low lipid diet only (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>); one study compared combined aerobic and PRE and metformin with metformin only (<LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>); and two studies had comparison groups that compared heavy with moderate exercise (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>). In 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>), exercise was described as supervised and in the remaining four studies, the level of supervision was not stated.</P>
<P>
<B>PARTICIPANTS OF INCLUDED STUDIES</B>
<BR/>A total of 454 participants were included in the review. Participants included adults living with HIV at various stages of HIV infection, with CD4 counts ranging from &lt;100 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> to greater than 1000 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. Studies included both men and women, with women comprising approximately 30% of the total number of participants. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 58 years. Six studies included participants who were on a combination antiretroviral regimen, defined as a combination of three or more different HIV medications. (<LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, Terry, 2006, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). Five studies included participants who were not on combination antiretroviral therapy; however, most if not all participants were taking some form of antiretroviral medications (<LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>), and three studies did not report on whether participants were taking antiretroviral therapy (LaPerriere 1990, <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>).

Other personal characteristics were reported inconsistently across studies.</P>
<P>
<B>OUTCOMES OF INCLUDED STUDIES</B>
<BR/>All 14 of the included studies assessed immunologic or virologic outcomes, or both, in the form of CD4 count (all 14 studies) or viral load (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>).

Nine of the 14 included studies assessed psychologic outcomes in the form of anxiety and depression, health status, depression, mood and life satisfaction, and health-related quality of life (LaPerriere 1990, <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). Adverse events were reported in three of the 14 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>).</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-07-07 15:11:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Each reviewer assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies based on the following criteria derived from the <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> checklist (#1-3) and assessed whether the groups were similar at baseline (#4). This criterion is used by the Cochrane Review Group on HIV Infection and AIDS. Instead of a formal score, a description of the methodologic quality based on the four criteria is provided below.</P>
<P>
<B>a) Was the study randomized? If yes, was the randomization process described?</B>
</P>
<P>All 14 included studies reported that they used randomization to allocate participants to a comparison group. However, only five of the studies described the process (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK> reported that they used a computer-generated randomization process. <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK> used a permuted-block algorithm with blocks of eight. <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK> reported using block randomization while stratifying for gender, and study identifier numbers were randomized and placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK> reported using randomized blocks of four participants. <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK> reported using a permuted-block algorithm.</P>
<P>
<B>b) Was the study double-blinded? If yes, how was the double-blinding obtained?</B>
</P>
<P>Allocation to a study group was single-blind for elements of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, participants were not told whether they had been randomized to the low-intensity group or the high-intensity group. In <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, all assessors of the graded exercise test were blinded to the participants' group assignment except for the principal investigator. For all other included studies, blinding was not specified.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>c) Was there a description of withdrawals and/or drop-outs?</B>
</P>
<P>Thirteen of the 14 included studies made reference to participants who withdrew from or were non-adherent (or non-compliant) with the study (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). Withdrawal rates were not reported by LaPerriere 1990. Rates of withdrawal and a description of reasons for withdrawal (when provided) are described below.<BR/>
<BR/>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK> was 32% (10/31). The reasons for withdrawal were described as lack of interest, lack of time, and economic and family issues.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK> was 24% (8/34). Reasons for withdrawal included transportation difficulties, conflicting work schedules, lack of motivation to exercise, and parole violation. No subjects reported dropping out due to illness. Participants who withdrew were equally distributed among the comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK> was 35% (13/37). Reasons for withdrawal included "health reasons" among both exercise and non-exercising counselling groups. Withdrawals reported within the exercise group were due to relocation of residence and withdrawals from the non-exercising counselling group were due to lack of interest. One participant in the counselling group died during this study; however, the death was not attributed to exercise.</P>
<P>The withdrawal or lack of adherence rate in <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK> was 51% (22/43). Reasons included geographic relocation, time limitations, starting school or employment, hospitalization, loss of interest, and dissatisfaction in being in the non-exercising control group. The report of illness as a reason for missing exercise sessions occurred with similar frequency among both compliant and non-compliant exercisers. There was no difference in withdrawal rates with respect to age, body composition, race, fitness level, or CD4 count at baseline for compliant and non-compliant exercisers.</P>
<P>The withdrawal and lack of adherence rate in <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK> was 76% (19/25). Reasons for non-adherence included illness, transportation difficulties, and reports that the exercise interventions were too difficult.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK> was 18% (11/60). All withdrawals were from the exercise group and reasons for withdrawal included employment, changes in schedule, transportation difficulties, family crises, and the time required for participation. No participant withdrew from this study due to illness.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK> was 15% (4/26). No participants withdrew from this study due to an adverse event, and the rates of withdrawal were similar among groups.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK> was 4% (1/22) (note that the withdrawal rate was calculated based on the aerobic and non-exercising control groups only, and not the PRE group). The one participant withdrew due to persistent infection.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK> was 44% (54/123). Reasons for withdrawal included work schedules, hospitalizations, geographical move from area, or loss of interest. There were significantly more women and African Americans who withdrew from the study and significantly more smokers than non-smokers who completed the exercise program.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK> was 32% (12/37). Reasons for withdrawal included elevations in resting lactic acid above prespecified safety parameters, personal issues, living too far away, and unwillingness to comply with exercise.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK> was 5% (2/40). Reasons for withdrawal included unwillingness to complete the study.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK> was 28% (12/42). Reasons for withdrawal included lack of interest, lack of time, and economic or family problems. One of the participants was not included in the analysis because he/she did not adhere to the antiretroviral regimen.</P>
<P>The withdrawal rate in <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> was 3% (3/100). Reasons for withdrawal included changing jobs and moving to a distant location, death following surgery, and loss to follow-up. Overall compliance with the exercise program (attendance to &gt;50% of the sessions) was 82.2%.</P>
<P>Adherence to the exercise intervention was reported in four of the 14 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, Mutimurra 2008a, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> reported 82.2% adherence rate and Perna (1999) reported 61% of participants were adherent with the exercise intervention. Both studies defined adherence as attending &gt;50% of the exercise sessions.<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK> reported that participants in the exercise group completed 96% of the total exercise interventions.These three studies also supervised the exercise intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK> reported six out of 25 of the participants were compliant with the exercise program (attended &gt;80% of the sessions), seven were somewhat compliant (attended 30%-80% of sessions) and 12 were not compliant (attended &lt;30% of sessions). Supervision of the exercise intervention was not reported in this study.<BR/>

<B>CORRESPONDENCE WITH AUTHORS</B>
</P>
<P>We wrote to, and received clarification and information from six authors of studies included in the initial systematic review. The additional information was used in the first update of this review and was reflected within the analyses and results. <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK> provided clarification regarding the number of withdrawals from the moderate- versus high-intensity group that confirmed the sample size in which analyses were conducted. <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK> provided VO2max data in mL/kg/min that allowed the incorporation of VO2max as an outcome in the meta-analysis update. <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK> provided clarification regarding the distribution of the number of participants between the low- and high-intensity intervention groups at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK> provided confirmation that analyses in this study were conducted on HIV-positive participants only (groups included HIV-positive and -negative participants). <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK> provided results from intention-to-treat analysis of exercise versus non-exercising control group. <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK> provided additional data on mean and standard deviation for all three comparison groups. <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK> confirmed that the participants in their study were the same participants as in <LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this third update, we wrote to <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK> who provided clarification / information on weight and standard error of the mean for the intervention and non-exercising control groups.

<P>
<B>META-ANALYSES</B>
</P>
<P>Thirty meta-analyses were completed in this review for immunologic and virologic outcomes (CD4 count, CD4 percentage, and viral load), cardiopulmonary outcomes (VO2max, HRmax, exercise time), weight and body composition outcomes (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, percent body fat, fat mass, leg muscle area), and psychological outcomes (depression-dejection subscale of the POMS). No meta-analyses for strength outcomes were possible. Subgroup comparisons of the meta-analyses include 1) constant or interval aerobic exercise versus non-exercising control; 2) constant aerobic exercise versus non-exercising control; 3) interval aerobic exercise versus non-exercising control; 4) moderate-intensity aerobic exercise versus heavy-intensity aerobic exercise; and 5) constant or interval aerobic exercise combined with PRE versus non-exercising control.</P>
<P>Seven of the 14 included studies compared constant or interval aerobic exercise with a non-exercising control group (<LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-LaPerriere--1990" TYPE="STUDY">LaPerriere 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). Two studies did not include a non-exercising control group (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK> included aerobic and PRE combined with metformin and <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK> included aerobic exercise combined with a low lipid diet and were unable to be combined in meta-analyses. Interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK> included aerobic exercise as well as PRE.</P>
<P>The number of meta-analyses was limited due to variability in types of exercise interventions (aerobic exercise vs. combined aerobic and PRE exercise), level of exercise supervision, types of outcomes reported, and methodological quality (see table of characteristics of included studies). Aerobic interventions in the trials varied according to constant compared to interval exercise and moderate compared to heavy intensity exercise, and combined aerobic and resistive exercise compared to aerobic exercise alone. For the purposes of this review, constant exercise is defined as exercise at a constant intensity for a period of time. Interval exercise is defined as exercise conducted at a varied intensity for a total period of time. See the table of characteristics of included studies for specific descriptions of constant and interval exercise in individual studies.</P>
<P>For this systematic review, a priori, we considered:<BR/>
<I>Immunuological and virological outcomes: </I>50 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> to indicate a clinically important change in CD4 count, 5% to indicate a clinically important change in CD4 percentage, 0.5 log<SUB>10</SUB>copies to indicate a clinically important change in viral load; <I>Cardiorespiratory outcomes:</I> 2 mL/kg/min to indicate a clinically important change in VO2max, 10 beats/min to indicate a clinically important change in HRmax, 5 minutes to indicate a clinically important change in exercise time; <I>Weight and Body Composition outcomes:</I> 3 kg to indicate a clinically important change in body weight (which equals approximately 5% of the average baseline body weight of the participants), 5 cm to indicate a clinically important change in girth (waist and hip circumference), 3 cm to indicate a clinically important change in waist-to-hip ratio, 5 kg/cm<SUP>2</SUP> to indicate a clinically important change in body mass index, 5 kg to indicate a clinically important change in fat mass, 5% to indicate a clinically important change in percent body fat, and 5 cm<SUP>2</SUP> to indicate a clinically important change in leg muscle area; <I>Strength outcomes: </I>5 kg to indicate a clinically important change in strength for lower extremities, 2 kg to indicate a clinically significant change in strength for upper extremities and; <I>Psychological outcomes:</I> 5.6 to indicate a clinically important change in the subscales of the POMS.</P>
<P>Anything below 20% CD4 percentage is equated to similar presentation as CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. Because 50 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> is the clinically important change in CD4 count, using the same ratio, we can estimate the clinically important difference in CD4 percentage to be 5%. This is likely a conservative estimate because CD4 percentage is more stable than CD4 counts, which tend to fluctuate more. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the fatigue subscale of the POMS is 5.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2002</LINK>), making this a reasonable estimate for the MCID of other POMS subscales. No other established MCID values exist for the other outcomes. Authors based the a priori estimates based on a combination of clinical experience and interpretations in the individual included studies.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity (<I>P</I>&lt;0.1) was evident in 16 of the 30 meta-analyses. Reasons for heterogeneity may include differences in the types of participants in relation to antiretroviral use, body composition, or gender, as well as methods of outcome measurement. We were able to conduct sensitivity analyses on four of the 16 meta-analyses with heterogeneity (those with greater than two studies included in the meta-analysis). We discuss the specific sensitivity results and reasons for heterogeneity within the sub-group analyses below.</P>

<BR/>
<B>A) IMMUNOLOGIC AND/OR VIROLOGIC OUTCOMES</B>
</P>
<P>All 14 included studies reported immunologic or virologic outcomes, or both. Ten of the studies included a non-exercising control group, three of which included combined interventions of aerobic and PRE (<LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK> also measured immunologic and virologic outcomes but did not include a non-exercising control group.</P>
<P>
<B>A-1) CD4 count</B>
</P>
<P>Five meta-analyses were performed. Overall, no significant changes in CD4 count were found between comparison groups. Meta-analyses demonstrated no difference in change in CD4 count for participants in the exercise intervention group compared with the non-exercising control group (WMD: 18.08 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -11.82, 47.99, n=306, <I>P</I>=0.24) (<LINK REF="STD-LaPerriere--1990" TYPE="STUDY">LaPerriere 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>) <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; no difference in change in CD4 count for participants in the constant aerobic aerobic exercise group compared with the non-exercising control group (WMD: -3.11 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% CI: -31.06, 24.84, n=261, <I>P</I>=0.83) (<LINK REF="STD-Lox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>); and a significant trend towards an improvement in CD4 count of 69.58 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> for participants in the interval aerobic exercise group compared with the non-exercising control group (95% CI: 14.08, 125.09, <I>P</I>=0.01, n=45) (<LINK REF="STD-LaPerriere--1990" TYPE="STUDY">LaPerriere 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-22" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 22</LINK>). The point estimate is above 50 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, which suggests a potential clinically important increase in CD4 count for interval exercisers compared with non-exercisers. Results showed no difference in change in CD4 count for participants exercising at moderate intensity compared with participants exercising at heavy intensity (WMD: -42.90 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% CI: -116.28, 30.47, n=39, <I>P</I>=0.25) (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-23" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 23</LINK>) and no difference in change in CD4 count for participants in a combined aerobic and PRE group compared with the non-exercising control group (WMD: 21.52 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% CI: -29.25, 72.28, n=84, <I>P</I>=0.41) (<LINK REF="STD-Rigsby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rigsby 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-25" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 25</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of five meta-analyses were statistically significant for heterogeneity (<I>P</I>&lt;0.1).

Reasons for heterogeneity may be due to differences in characteristics of participants in the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>A-2) CD4 Percentage</B>
</P>
<P>Two meta-analyses were performed for CD4 percentage that included the same studies. Meta-analyses demonstrated no difference in change in CD4 percentage for participants in the exercise intervention group compared with the non-exercising control group as well as the constant aerobic exercise group compared with the non-exercising control (WMD: -0.33%, 95% CI: -1.98, 1.32, n=118, <I>P</I>=0.69) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>A-3) Viral Load</B>
</P>
<P>Three meta-analyses were performed for viral load, of which two included the same studies.

<B>B-1) VO2max</B>
</P>
<P>Three meta-analyses were performed for VO2max. Meta-analyses showed a significant improvement in change of VO2max of 2.63 mL/kg/min for participants in the aerobic exercise intervention group compared with the non-exercising control group (95% CI: 1.19, 4.07, n=276, <I>P</I>=0.0003) (<LINK REF="STD-Perna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perna 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>); significant improvement in change of VO2max of 2.40 ml/kg/min for participants in the constant aerobic exercise group compared with the non-exercising control group (95% CI: 0.82, 3.99, n=248, <I>P</I>=0.003) (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>) <LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>; and a significant trend towards a greater improvement in VO2max of 4.30 mL/kg/min for participants in the heavy-intensity exercise group compared with the moderate-intensity exercise group (95% CI: 0.61, 7.98, n=24, <I>P</I>=0.02) (<LINK REF="FIG-24" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 24</LINK>). All point estimates are greater than 2 mL/kg/min, which suggests a potential clinically important improvement in VO2max among exercisers and a greater improvement with heavy- versus moderate-intensity exercise.</P>
<P>Two of three meta-analyses were statistically significant for heterogeneity (<I>P</I>&lt;0.1). Sensitivity analyses indicated that removing <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> from the aerobic versus non-exercise comparison (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and the constant exercise versus non-exercise comparison (<LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>) successfully removed heterogeneity. Results for overall effect remained statistically significant favouring exercise; however, the point estimate was reduced to 1.64 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 1.06, 2.22) and 1.53 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 0.94, 2.12), respectively, which are below the threshold for clinical importance. Reasons for heterogeneity may be due to differences in characteristics of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> study; they were from Rwanda and all possessed moderate to severe body fat redistribution.</P>

<B>F) ADVERSE EVENTS (SAFETY)</B>
</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-07 13:33:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the review should be interpreted cautiously for a variety of reasons. This review is based on a small number of trials (n=14). Meta-analyses were limited due to variation in outcome measures used and types of interventions, enabling only two to seven studies to be combined in meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Individual studies in this review included small sample sizes and high withdrawal or non-adherence rates (3%-76%). Participants who withdrew from the exercise program were often excluded from the results by the authors, resulting in a per protocol approach to the analysis. Thus, the overall findings among those who continued to exercise might not reflect the general experience of exercise among adults living with HIV. In addition, publication bias may result in fewer studies with negative results being published. Furthermore, the inability to blind participants to the aerobic exercise intervention may have resulted in a Hawthorne effect, whereby participants might perceive greater benefits associated with exercise based on the expectation that exercise should be linked to positive outcomes. In addition, the lack of assessor blinding may have resulted in assessor bias whereby assessors may have measured outcomes in favour of the exercise intervention. Moreover, the majority of study participants were men between the ages of 18-58 years. This limits the external validity and ability to generalize results to women and older adults living with HIV. Finally, the maximum duration of aerobic exercise intervention was 24 weeks. Thus the long-term sustainable effects of aerobic exercise remain less clear.</P>
<P>Taking into account these limitations, we offer the following summary of our findings:</P>
<P>In this third update of the systematic review, four additional studies were incorporated into the results and conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>), two of which we were able to include in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK>). In addition, we broadened the outcomes considered in this update to include strength, weight, and body composition. This allowed 14 new meta-analyses to be performed for outcomes of exercise time, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, percent body fat, fat mass, and leg muscle area. These additional studies were also incorporated in existing meta-analyses of CD4 count and viral load.</P>
<P>Results of meta-analyses showed statistically significant improvements for some outcomes of cardiopulmonary outcomes (VO2max), body composition (leg muscle area, percent body fat), and psychological status (depression-dejection subscale of the POMS). Cardiopulmonary status results demonstrated potentially clinical important improvements in VO2max among exercisers compared with non-exercisers, and even greater improvements among participants doing heavy- compared with moderate-intensity exercise. Body composition results demonstrated a significant increase in leg muscle area among combined progressive resistive and aerobic exercisers compared with non-exercisers and decreases in percent body fat among exercisers compared with non-exercisers and specifically constant exercisers compared with non-exercisers. Psychological status results demonstrated significant and clinically important improvements in depression symptoms among exercisers compared to non-exercisers. No significant differences were found in all but one meta-analysis for CD4 count or viral load outcomes, suggesting that aerobic exercise has little impact on immunological or virological status.</P>
<P>Aside from meta-analyses, individual studies reported significant results that demonstrated benefits of aerobic exercise interventions compared with non-exercise. Twelve of the 13 included individual studies that measured cardiopulmonary outcomes demonstrated statistically significant improvements among exercisers. Five of the six individual studies that measured strength found significant increases in strength among exercisers. Six of the nine studies<B> </B>that measured weight and/or body composition found significant changes among exercisers compared with non-exercisers. Furthermore all nine studies that measured psychological status found significant improvements in outcomes for exercisers compared with non-exercisers.</P>

<P>This review indicates that aerobic exercise plays an important role in the care of adults living with HIV. Meta-analyses suggest that performing constant or interval aerobic exercise, or a combination of constant aerobic and PRE for at least 20 minutes three times per week for at least five weeks appears to be safe and may lead to improvements in selected outcomes of cardiopulmonary fitness (VO2max), body composition (leg muscle area, percent body fat), and psychological status (depression-dejection symptoms). We also found a trend towards potential clinically important improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness and psychological status. Results for other meta-analyses were not significant. Results of this review suggest that aerobic exercise appears to be safe for adults living with HIV who are medically stable. This finding is based on the absence of reports of adverse events among exercisers within individual studies and the stability of CD4 count and viral load. Findings should be interpreted cautiously because results are based on participants who completed the exercise interventions and for whom there were adequate follow-up data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-07 13:39:20 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence on aerobic exercise and HIV has emerged with the changing face of the disease. Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise for adults living with HIV is increasing, including more recent narrative reviews that support the use of aerobic exercise interventions in the context of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Scevola-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scevola 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dudgeon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudgeon 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cade-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cade 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hand-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hand 2009</LINK>).<B> </B>Prior to the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy, studies on exercise tended to include participants with AIDS-wasting, whereas recent evidence includes participants on combination antiretroviral therapy with lipodystrophy, body fat redistribution, or hyperinsulinemia. These studies commonly assessed the impact of exercise on weight, body composition, and metabolic outcomes, and reflects our decision to broaden our outcomes to include weight and body composition in this review. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies include interventions with a combination of resistive and aerobic exercise. Many studies assessing PRE include strength as an outcome, which led us to include this outcome in this updated review, and add a subgroup analysis that specifically evaluates the effectiveness of combined PRE and aerobic exercise with non-exercise.<B> </B>Next, an increasing number of studies we came across in this update assessed interventions such as tai chi (<LINK REF="STD-Robins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Robins 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Galantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galantino 2005</LINK>), diet (Engleson 2006), or co-interventions with exercise, such as metformin (<LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2004a</LINK>) and low lipid diets (<LINK REF="STD-Terry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Terry 2006</LINK>). As further research emerges that considers these co-interventions, we expect that we will be able to carry out meta-analyses that specifically assess the effectiveness of these co-interventions. Finally, this update reflected an increasing number of studies with women, increasing the proportion of women in this systematic review to 30% (an increase from ~15% in the previous update). Nevertheless, women remain largely under-represented in this review. Finally, with combination antiretroviral therapy now increasingly reaching developing countries, this update includes the first study to assess the impact of aerobic exercise in the developing country context (<LINK REF="STD-Mutimura-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Mutimura 2008a</LINK> and 2008b).</P>
<P>Results of this review are limited by small sample sizes and high withdrawal rates. In several studies, participants who dropped out of the exercise program or were non-adherent with exercise were not included in the final results for that study. This raises issues of effectiveness and safety of exercise among those who stop exercising. Future studies should make every effort to include all participants in an "intent-to-treat" analysis with follow-up and results on those who withdraw from exercise programs.</P>
<P>Results are further limited by the lack of participant and assessor blinding among included studies. Given it is often difficult to achieve participant blinding with exercise interventions, future research may include blinding participants to different groups of exercise frequency, intensity, duration, and type. Future research could also ensure that assessors of outcomes are blinded to reduce the potential for assessor bias.</P>
<P>The long-term effects of exercise also require attention. All studies were conducted for 15 weeks or less, except for two 24-week studies. Further research should explore the different effects of interval versus constant exercise, as well as aerobic exercise in conjunction with other exercise treatment interventions.</P>
<P>In addition, if future research includes clinically meaningful and standardized outcomes of HRQL, strength, and cardiopulmonary measures (including fatigue), we may be able to incorporate additional outcomes in our review and strengthen existing meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Finally, as an increasing number of individuals age with HIV, further research is needed to investigate the effects of exercise among older adults living with HIV, including those living with multiple concurrent health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis, which may have implications for the future safety and effect of exercise for people living with HIV.</P>

<P>AUTHOR'S COMMENTS: This study looked at exercise across entire range of disease spectrum. Only one participant who had progressed to AIDS completed the exercise protocol. This participant demonstrated similar results to the others. Exercise could exert an immune response that is not reflected in the clinical measures taken. Also note: for the purposes of this review, 'non-exercising control group' was defined as non-exercise. In this study, however, the controls received 90-120 minutes of counselling 1-2 x/week for 12 weeks.</P>

<P>IMMUNE INDICES: No significant changes in CD4 count between groups (no measure of viral load).<BR/>CARDIOPULMONARY OUTCOMES: Exercise group achieved a higher heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) at the end of the 20 metre multi-stage shuttle run test (20mMST). Significant improvements in VO2max among exercisers compared with non-exercisers as measured by the 20mMST.<BR/>STRENGTH OUTCOMES: Not measured.<BR/>BODY COMPOSITION OUTCOMES: Significant decrease in body mass index (BMI), percent body fat mas (BFM), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio among exercisers whereas these outcomes remained unchanged or increased among non-exercisers. Significant decrease in percent body fat mass (%) and total body fat redistribution score (BFR) among exercisers compared with non-exercisers. Significant decrease in triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, and sum of skinfold thickness decreased more in the exercisers compared with non-exercisers. No change in hip circumference in either group.<BR/>ADVERSE EVENTS: Adverse events within the study were not reported.<BR/>AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training positively improves body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness in HAART-treated HIV+ African participants with Body Fat Redistribution. Results imply that exercise training is a safe, inexpensive, practical and effective treatment for evolving metabolic and cardiovascular syndromes associated with HIV and HAART exposure in resource-limited settings such as Su-Saharan Africa.</P>
