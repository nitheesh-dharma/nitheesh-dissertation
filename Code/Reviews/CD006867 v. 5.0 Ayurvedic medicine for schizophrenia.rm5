<P>Ayurvedic medicine was developed in India over 3000 years ago and is the oldest medical system to have survived until the present time.  It sees each individual as having a unique mind-body constitution and set of life circumstances. It is similar to traditional Chinese medicine in believing that matter and energy are the same thing. Treatment in an ayurvedic system is holistic, involving natural medicine, massage, diet and the regulation of lifestyle. Ayurveda has been used for the treatment of schizophrenia, a serious long-term mental health condition, since its formulation (c1000 BCE) although nowadays Western-style medication using antipsychotics and hospital treatment are also used. </P>
<P>This review examines randomised controlled trials which compare aspects of ayurvedic medicine with the use of antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. All trials took place in India and were for 12 weeks or less. When the ayurvedic herbs brahmyadiyoga and tagara were compared to placebo (2 trials) there was no significant difference between the two groups in acceptability of treatment or overall improvement.  The brahmyadiyoga group did, however, show some improvement when assessed ayurvedically (a combination of assessing aspects of the mind, decision, orientation, memory and habit, and looking for the absence of symptoms of illness). When these two herbs were compared to groups of people taking the antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, again there was no difference in acceptability of treatment, but in one of the two trials there was an improvement in mental state in those taking chlorpromazine. There was also a trial comparing an ayurvedic package (of herbs and other treatment) to chlorpromazine, and although both treatments were acceptable, the rest of the data were not able to be used.  Brahmyadiyoga and tagara tended to have vomiting and nausea as an adverse effect, while chlorpromazine caused people to be sleepy. It may be possible that ayurvedic treatments could be used as adjuncts to antipsychotic medication. A new larger trial comparing ayurvedic herb(s) alone, chlorpromazine alone and both together would answer this question.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems since1000 BC.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included study.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all clinical randomised trials comparing Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently extracted data and calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill people with schizophrenia, it is equally (~10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Developed in India more than 3000 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Subbarayappa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbarayappa 2001</LINK>), Ayurvedic medicine or Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems known. Many other ancient systems of natural medicine are believed to have their roots in Ayurveda. </P>
<P>Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word for the 'Knowledge of Life, defining the trinity of life as body, mind and spiritual awareness. Knowledge arranged systematically with logic becomes science. It is a complete and holistic science of healthy balanced living that views each person as an individual, with a unique mind-body constitution and set of life circumstances. Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine are very similar, being based on universal natural bi-polar concepts that matter and energy are one. Ayurveda aims to promote health and cure disease through holistic methods involving natural medicine, diet, regulated lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-Neddermeyer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neddermeyer 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lad 1996</LINK>). The Ayurvedic compendium comprises eight branches: Kayachikitsa (internal medicine); Salya tantra (surgery); Salakya tantra (ophthalmology and ENT); Kaumarabrhtya (paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology); Agadatantra (toxicology); Rasayana (geriatrics and nutrition); Vajikarana (sexology); Bhuta vidya (psychiatry and demonology) as described in Ayurvedic classics. The two Ayurvedic classics are the Charaka samhita and the Susruta samhita (<LINK REF="REF-Subbarayappa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbarayappa 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ayurveda recognises the fundamental importance of examination by direct perception (pratyaksa) and inference (anumana). In addition, it also accepts verbal or textual knowledge (aptopadesa) and experimentation (yukti). A physician of Ayurveda carries out a physical examination using his five senses (pancendriya pariksa) and elicits patient history (prasna) (<LINK REF="REF-Subbarayappa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbarayappa 2001</LINK>). Therapy consists of three major categories: divine therapy (daiva vyapasraya), rational therapy (yukti vyapasraya cikitsa) and psychotherapy (sattvavajaya) (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1994</LINK>). There are more than 400 drugs listed in The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (<LINK REF="REF-API_x002d_2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">API-2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia today since their development in the 1950s. The role of Ayurveda in treatment of mental illnesses, however, dates back to the Vedic period (c. 1000 BC) (<LINK REF="REF-Subbarayappa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbarayappa 2001</LINK>), and it is still being used as sole treatment or in conjunction with antipsychotic medication in both developing and developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Walter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 1999</LINK>). For example, nearly three quarters of people living in the USA of Asian origin used some kind of Complementary and Alternative medicine in the past 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Hsiao-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsiao 2006</LINK>). Also these drugs are socially acceptable, better tolerated and less expensive than conventional modern treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Russinova-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russinova 2002</LINK>). We know of no systematic review of their effects.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of Ayurvedic medicine compared with antipsychotic, placebo or no treatment for people with schizophrenia.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised, we included these trials in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see 'Types of outcome measures') when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then we included these in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we only used clearly randomised trials and the results of the sensitivity analysis were described in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocated by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included people with schizophrenia, schizophreniform psychosis and schizophrenia-like illnesses, diagnosed by any criteria.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. Electronic searches<BR/>1.2 We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[((*ayurved* or * brahm* or *hindu* or *siddha* or *unmada*) in title, abstract and index fields in REFERENCE) OR ((*ayurved* or *brahm* or *hindu* or *siddha*) in interventions field in STUDY)]</P>
<P>This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, hand searches and conference proceedings (see Group Module).</P>
<P>1.3 We searched AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine -1985 to March 2007) (March 2007) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[((exp clinical trials/ or exp randomized controlled trials/ or exp double-blind method/ or exp random allocation/ or randomized controlled trial.pt. or clinical trial.pt. or controlled clinical trial.pt. or clinic$ adj4 trial$).mp. or (random$ adj5 (assign$ or allocat$ or assort$)).mp. or (randomi$ adj5 control$ adj5 trial$).mp. or (crossover or cross-over).mp. or ((singl$ or doubl$ or trebl$ or tripl$) adj (blind$ or mask$)).mp.) and (exp mental disorders/) and (ayrved$.mp. or ayurved$.mp. or ayruvedic.mp. or exp ayurvedic medicine/)] </P>
<P>2. Reference lists<BR/>We inspected references of all identified studies (included and excluded) for further relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. Personal contact<BR/>We contacted the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials and extra data on the published trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of studies<BR/>We (VA and AB) independently inspected all reports. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with (PR). Where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we (VA and AA) decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion with PR, we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), which is based on the degree of allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Category A includes studies in which allocation has been randomised and concealment is explicit. Category B studies are those which have randomised allocation but in which concealment is not explicit. Category C studies are those in which allocation has neither been randomised nor concealed. Only trials that are stated to be randomised (categories A or B of the handbook) will be included in this review. The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible we did not enter the data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained.</P>
<P>3. Data management</P>
<P>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We (VA and AA) independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose, we attempted to resolve these by discussion with PR. When disputes could still not be resolved we did not enter the data, but added the outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis <BR/>We excluded data from outcomes where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up (this does not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we considered people leaving the study early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of adverse effects and death. </P>
<P>We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did not add this data to trials with less attrition, but presented the data separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis </P>
<P>4.1 Binary data <BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated an estimate of the relative risk (RR) (or risk difference (RD) when pooled data included studies with no event scores in both groups) and its 95% (fixed effect) confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we also calculated the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) statistic. Where heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we investigated the reasons for this.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data <BR/>4.2.1 Skewed data: <BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); In cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in RevMan graphs to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew. </P>
<P>4.2.2 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented final endpoint data . We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We are contacting authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures. </P>
<P>4.2.3 Summary statistic: For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups using a fixed effects model. Again, if heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we investigated reasons for this. </P>
<P>4.2.4 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or are ad hoc. Unpublished instruments are more likely to represent statistically significant findings than those that have been put into print (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore, we included only continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). </P>
<P>4.2.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity <BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this by using primarily the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of considerable levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where heterogeneity was present, reasons for this were investigated. If it substantially altered the results, data were not summated, but presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered all data from the included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>7. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for Ayurvedic medicine.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of the studies please see Included and Excluded Studies tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We have excluded four studies in this review. All four were full journal articles (<LINK REF="STD-Farag-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Farag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fozdar-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Fozdar 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hakim-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Hakim 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fozdar-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Fozdar 1962</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1986</LINK> were not randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Farag-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Farag 2003</LINK> was randomised but recruited people with sleep onset insomnia and not those suffering from schizophrenia. We have not included all the studies included in the chapter on "Review of Previous Studies" from <LINK REF="REF-Ramu-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramu 1999b</LINK> as they were all case series.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>Two studies are currently awaiting assessment. Both reports are minimal and contain no usable data. Interestingly, none of these studies were identified by our standard but comprehensive database search. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1985</LINK> was picked up from our extra search conducted on AMED. Our web search led us to the <LINK REF="REF-CCRAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCRAS</LINK> (Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha) website and correspondence with them gave us the book Ayurvedic Management of Unmada (Schizophrenia). <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1964</LINK> was obtained from this book. We have contacted the relevant authorities at <LINK REF="REF-CCRAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCRAS</LINK> to acquire more information on <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1964</LINK>. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We are not aware of any ongoing studies.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We have included three studies in this review. Two, <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK>, were identified through our electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> was obtained from a book sent to us by the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha, in New Delhi, India. Only <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> was described as randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> were said to be double blinded. </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness that affects young people. All the included studies reported data on short-term follow-up (up to 12 weeks). </P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> participants had been diagnosed with schizophrenia using ICD-9 classification. While one study used the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia in accordance with the NIMHANS collaborative study (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>), another, <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>, stated hat they used the WHO glossary of mental disorders to diagnose schizophrenia. Participants from all the three studies had been diagnosed, using the Ayurvedic classification, as unmada. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> employed the Charaka Ayurvedic definition while another used the Laksana Ayurvedic definition for schizophrenia. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> did not report the sex of participants. Though the male to female ratio was uneven in the other two studies, the total number of participants on pooling both the studies did not vary significantly with respect to sex. The mean age of participants from all three studies was about 28 years. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> recruited people suffering from schizophrenia over a period of two to ten years, while <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> only recruited people with less than a two year history of schizophrenia. We could not elicit any exclusion criteria from <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> while the other two studies excluded stupor, epilepsy and learning disability. No trial gave information about the severity of illness, although <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> mentioned that participants had active psychotic symptoms for a minimum duration of one month.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> was described as taking place in an inpatient department while <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> were described as taking place in hospital settings.</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>All three studies are small. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> with 136 participants was the largest of the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> included 78 people while <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> recruited only 36.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>The main Ayurvedic herb used in all three studies is brahmyadiyoga. When brahmyadiyoga was used on its own (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>), it was administered at a mean dose of 12 mg/day at a range of 8-16 mg/day in four times a day schedules. In <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK>, where a complex Ayurvedic treatment was given, brahmayadiyoga was one of the components and was administered at a dose of 500 mg. The other Ayurvedic herb administered was tagara (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>) at a dosage of 8-12 mg/day. All three studies compared the Ayurvedic medication with chlorpromazine (200-450 mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> also used placebo as a comparator. All medications were administered orally.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> compared brahmyadiyoga and tagara with placebo and reported usable data on mental state and leaving the study early. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> also reported usable data on mental state and leaving the study early for the brahmyadiyoga versus placebo comparison. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> did not compare Ayurvedic treatment to placebo. Some of the data provided by <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> were very skewed and we have reported these in other data tables.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> compared Ayurvedic herbs (brahmyadiyoga) with antipsychotic chlorpromazine. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> also compared tagara (another Ayurvedic herb) with chlorpromazine. Both studies recorded usable data on mental state and number of participants leaving the study early. Some of the data provided by <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> were very skewed and we have reported these in other data tables.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> compared Ayurvedic treatment (complex combination of a number of medications) with chlorpromazine and reported data on mental state and leaving the study early. Most of the data reported on mental state were very skewed and we have reported these in other data tables.</P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: details of the only scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' table.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale - PSRS (<LINK REF="REF-Rockland-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockland 1965</LINK>)<BR/>This rating scale provides a quantified profile of the reflection of clinical judgement, impressions of degree and nature of psychotic symptomatology. The normality of behaviour, effect or cognition is indicated by the zero score, where as the psychopathology in these areas increases, the score becomes positive or negative. The whole scale total scores are used as quantitative measures of psychosis to compare patient to patient and to compare the patient over time. The sub totals in each category indicate whether the major portion is in the behaviour, affect or cognition. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> used of this rating scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is a brief rating scale used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. The original scale has 16 items (although a revised 18-item scale is commonly used). Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Total scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. Only <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> used this scale to assess the changes in mental state.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Ayurvedic Assessment<BR/>Ayurvedic assessment is comprised of two separate assessments. The first assessment involves the examination of mental aspects: Manas (mind), Buddhi (decision), Sanjnana(orientation and responsiveness), Smrti (memory), Bhakti (desire), Sila (habit), Cesta (psychomotor activity) and Acara (conduct); in a proforma structured for this purpose. In the second assessment, the presence or absence of Laksana (signs and symptoms) of Dosaga Unmada after the treatment period is noted. The guidelines for completing this proforma can be obtained from <LINK REF="REF-Ramu-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramu 1999c</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.1<B>.</B>4 Fergus Falls Behaviour rating scale (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1953</LINK>)<BR/>This is an early ward behaviour scale which has been used with a broad range of hospitalised patients. It provides a single summed score, and is a quick, convenient, fairly objective method of rating behaviour, with which even inexperienced raters obtained greater than 90% agreement. The scale is of the semi-checklist type. Severity judgements are not necessary. Instead, for each statement, the rater has to indicate whether the item does or does not apply to the condition of the patient. Detailed rating instructions are provided which guarantee high inter-rater reliability. One of the 11 categories, 'responds to electroshock or insulin therapy', reflects the scale's age and should be rephrased to 'response to therapy'. This would make the scale more adequate and would probably not affect its reliability or validity. The items cover most of the areas considered to be essential components of ward behaviour scales. In spite of its simplicity for use and good coverage of ward behaviour, this scale seems to have been replaced by those more recently developed. The scale requires seven to ten minutes for completion.</P>
<P>4.6.2 Redundant data<BR/>Enormous efforts are usually invested in studies rating and recording data that are then reported in such a way as to render them useless for reviews such as this. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> the trialists compared Ayurvedic treatment with chlorpromazine. The outcome of change in mental state using Ayurvedic assessment was reported in an obscure manner in that they reported the means without the standard deviations. Such results are of no value to us. We have tried to contact the trialists to obtain the standard deviations. Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> the data provided on spiral after effect had attrition rates &gt;40%, that the data was considered redundant. </P>
<P>4.6.3 Missing outcomes<BR/>No usable outcomes were found for the following categories: death, global state, general functioning, quality of life and service outcomes. It is surprising that none of the included studies have reported on changes in global state.</P>
<P>4.6.4 Primary outcomes<BR/>Our primary outcome of adverse effects was reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> (n=78). None of our other primary outcomes were reported.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>Out of the three included studies, one, <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>, was stated to be randomised. This study, however did not explicitly explain the method of randomisation. None of the studies have categorically mentioned the method of allocation concealment. This concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>), therefore, all trials have been assigned to category B (moderate risk of bias, see Methods). </P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Two studies were described as being double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>). One, <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK>, was described as rater-blinded. None of the studies described the process of blinding. Testing of blinding was not reported in any of the three studies.</P>
<P>3. Loss to follow up<BR/>None of the studies attempted to follow up those who had left the study early. While <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> reported "escape and leaving against medical advice" as the reason for 28 people leaving early, <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> did not give any specific reason why 13 people discontinued. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> did not give specific reasons for two people leaving early, although this study did account for the remaining three who discontinued. None of the studies had dropout rates greater than 40%.</P>
<P>4. Data reporting <BR/>Overall most of the data we found could be used. Findings which are presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as p-values are often of little use to a reviewer. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> failed to provide standard deviations along with the mean values for the outcomes of a psychological assessment conducted to observe cognitive changes. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> reported on the spiral after effect outcomes of just less than 40% of the trial participants. These particular outcomes from these two trials could not be used for this review. We are seeking further data regarding these outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> had presented the results of adverse effects experienced by the participants in a slightly awkward and complicated fashion. However we have been able to extract these data.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/> The standard search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) resulted in two citations (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK>). We included both of these in the review. Inspection of the list of references from these two studies warranted further inspection of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fozdar-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Fozdar 1962</LINK>). This study was eventually excluded (see Characteristics of excluded studies table). An extra search conducted on AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine,1985 - 2007) resulted in 23 citations. Only <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1985</LINK> identified in this search was thought to be relevant and is waiting further assessment as we have not been able to get hold of the full text version. We felt that two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Farag-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Farag 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1986</LINK>, should be mentioned in the excluded studies group (see Characteristics of excluded studies table). An additional web search gave links to <LINK REF="REF-CCRAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCRAS</LINK> (Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha). Correspondence with <LINK REF="REF-CCRAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCRAS</LINK> resulted in the procurement of a textbook titled "Ayurvedic Management of Unmada (Schizophrenia)". This book contained the entire text of the two studies which our standard search had identified. In addition, we obtained another study (<LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>) which we felt could be included in this review. We also obtained part of the abstract of another study (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1964</LINK>) which seems relevant and have contacted <LINK REF="REF-CCRAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCRAS</LINK> for the full text. We have included this last study in the category awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1: AYURVEDIC HERBS versus PLACEBO<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>, total n=214) compared Ayurvedic herbs with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> compared two types of herbs, brahmyadiyoga and tagara, with placebo. In the title of the article <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> stated that it is a comparison between brahmyadiyoga and tagara versus placebo but they have not mentioned tagara in the text of the report. </P>
<P>2.1 Leaving the studies early (any reason, adverse events, inefficacy of treatment)<BR/>Overall 17% of people allocated to the brahmyadiyoga left the studies in the short term before the end of the trials and this compares with 22% in the placebo group (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62).</P>
<P>2.2 Global state<BR/>None of the included studies reported usable data on changes in the global state.</P>
<P>2.3 Mental state (with particular reference to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> assessed changes in mental state using PSRS, MPQ and ayurvedic assessment tools. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> employed PSRS and psychological assessment tools to observe changes in mental state.</P>
<P>2.3.1 Not Improved<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> recorded usable data in changes in mental state using MPQ and Ayurvedic assessment and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> with a tool that was not clearly described. The only statistically significant result was found in the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). The overall change observed among the two groups is of no statistical significance.</P>
<P>2.3.2 Uncooperative or did not respond (MPQ assessment)<BR/>This accounts for those participants who were not accounted for during MPQ assessment. Here the trialists found no clear differences (n=68, RR for brahmyadiyoga 2.00 CI 0.39 to 10.20).</P>
<P>2.3.3 Average improvement - positive or negative symptoms<BR/>The results of these comparisons could not be analysed as they were highly skewed. However, findings, as reported in the trial <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> did tend to favour brahmyadiyoga. </P>
<P>2.4 Behaviour<BR/>The Fergus Falls behaviour rating scale recorded non-skewed data. It showed no difference between groups (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). </P>
<P>2.5 Psychological assessment<BR/>Only critical flicker fusion threshold recorded data we could analyse and there were no clear differences between groups. Reaction time and vigilance data were much skewed but there was no clear suggestion of a difference between groups.</P>
<P>2.6 Adverse effects<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> reported on "clinically relevant" specific adverse effects. Nausea and vomiting were found only in the brahmyadiyoga group as opposed to the placebo group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). Drowsiness was absent in either groups. Overall none of the adverse effects were statistically significant, although numbers are small and confidence intervals wide.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2: AYURVEDIC HERBS versus ANTIPSYCHOTIC<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> compared Ayurvedic herbs with chlorpromazine (total n=120). Mahal compared two types of herbs, brahmyadiyoga and tagara, with chlorpromazine. The title of <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> stated a comparison between brahmyadiyoga and tagara but did not mentioned tagara again anywhere in the text.</P>
<P>3.1 Leaving the studies early (any reason, adverse events, inefficacy of treatment)<BR/>Equal numbers of people left the study early from brahmyadiyoga, tagara and chlorpromazine (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97). </P>
<P>3.2 Mental state (with particular reference to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia)<BR/>3.2.1 Not Improved<BR/>There were no significant differences in the mental state comparisons between brahmyadiyoga and chlorpromazine in the <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> however reported significantly less improvement in the brahmyadiyoga group (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> showed comparatively less improvement with the use of tagara when assessed using MPQ (n=68, RR 2.00 CI 1.25 to 3.19).</P>
<P>3.2.2 Uncooperative or did not comprehend<BR/>No significant difference can be found between the usage of brahmyadiyoga or tagara versus chlorpromazine (n=68, 1 RCT, RR for brahmyadiyoga 1.00 CI 0.27 to 3.68).</P>
<P>3.2.3 Average improvement or endpoint scores - positive symptoms and negative symptoms (PSRS).<BR/>Data recorded on the average improvements or endpoint scores in both positive and negative symptom scores were highly skewed but, if anything, tended to favour the chlorpromazine group.</P>
<P>3.3 Behaviour<BR/>The Fergus Falls behaviour rating scale provided usable data (<LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>). The results however showed no clear differences between the effects of brahmyadiyoga and chlorpromazine. </P>
<P>3.4 Psychological assessment<BR/>The Critical flicker fusion threshold provided data that we could analyse (<LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>). None of the results however showed any differences between the effects of brahmyadiyoga and chlorpromazine. </P>
<P>3.5 Adverse effects<BR/>Specific adverse effects were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK>. Nausea and vomiting were found only with the use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38) while drowsiness was present only among those who were administered chlorpromazine. The incidence of giddiness or somnolence in was similar for both groups.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 3: AYURVEDIC TREATMENT versus ANTIPSYCHOTIC<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1992</LINK> (n=36) compared the effects of Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, with those of chlorpromazine in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.</P>
<P>4.1 Leaving the studies early (any reason, adverse events, inefficacy of treatment)<BR/>There was no difference in the number of participants leaving the study early between those on Ayurvedic treatment and those being administered chlorpromazine (~10%, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53).</P>
<P>4.2 Mental state (with particular reference to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia)<BR/>The average endpoint and change scores recorded on BPRS or during Ayurvedic assessment could not be analysed as data were skewed, but most scores do seem to favour the chlorpromazine group. However, inspecting the raw scores does not suggest that there are any great differences between the two treatment groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of findings<BR/>All of the included studies took place in India. We do not know if the findings of this review are transferable to patients in different clinical settings from geographical areas distinct from the Indian subcontinent. Even if there is an element of a placebo effect, this in itself may vary from continent to continent. </P>
<P>All the included trials were of very short term duration. Since schizophrenia has a chronic course, there is the need for trials conducted for longer periods of time to inform practice. People take these treatments for years. It is perfectly feasible that effects may not appear until after a considerable period. Just as conventional antipsychotic drugs have a swift onset of action and little evidence for their longer term effects, the converse may be true for Ayurvedic treatments.</P>
<P>2. Limited data<BR/>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, no outcome data were available on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning. The primary outcome of this review was change in global state and no data were available on this broad, clinically meaningful, outcome.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 1: AYURVEDIC HERBS versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>In the sort term, about 20% of people left both groups. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999</LINK> did not cite any specific reasons for the attrition rates while <LINK REF="STD-Mahal-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mahal 1976</LINK> cited reasons such as escape and "left against medical advice". There is no evidence from these studies that Ayurvedic medication is a major cause of unacceptable short term problems. Mental state was measured in numerous ways. When ayurvedic assessment tools were employed, brahmyadigyoga had advantage over placebo for the outcome of not improved (NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). This is a finding that needs to be replicated and explained for readers of the study. We are unsure if the difference between improved and not improved has clinical meaning. It was a shame that no outcomes relevant to global state were reported. There was no suggestion on the Fergus Falls scale, noted for its real-world pragmatism, of an effect on behaviour. There is a suggestion that brahmyadiyoga causes nausea and vomiting. These herbal treatments are not innocuous, and their effects are well worth full investigation.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 2: AYURVEDIC HERBS versus ANTIPSYCHOTIC</P>
<P>Very few people left these short studies early, indicating perhaps that not only are Ayurvedic herbs acceptable, but so too was the trial design. Again, mental state was measured in several different ways and for each of the herbal preparations. Results tended to favour the short term effects of chlorpromazine over the herbs. This does not mean that the herbs could not have a short term effect that has gone unnoticed. However, the findings from these limited studies are not encouraging. It could be that the Ayurvedic treatments do only have a positive effect in the longer term, but we have no evidence for this. If they are being prescribed for short term benefit, evidence is lacking. Ratings on behaviour also tended to favour the chlorpromazine group. Chlorpromazine does cause drowsiness so we were reassured that adverse effects were being well reported. Again, trials in this comparison implicated brahmyadiyoga to cause nausea and vomiting. This is a herb that is not without problematic effects (NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). </P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 3: AYURVEDIC TREATMENT versus ANTIPSYCHOTIC</P>
<P>One very small study (n=36) investigated the effects of Ayurvedic treatment (comprising of a mixture of herbs, psycho-behavioural therapy and occupational therapy), comparing it with chlorpromazine for acutely ill people with schizophrenia. Again, in the context in which it was given, Ayurvedic treatment is acceptable in the short term. All mental state measures have produced skewed results, but do tend to suggest that the overall Ayurvedic package held its own against chlorpromazine. This is much too small and short a trial to produce conclusive evidence upon which to base care. It is hypothesis generating and it may be that for this intervention more trials are justified, at least as an adjunct to modern drugs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Most people given Ayurvedic medication or placebo do not show short term mental state improvement, although there is some weak suggestion that brahmyadiyoga may help more than placebo. When compared with a conventional antipsychotic such as chlorpromazine, Ayurvedic treatment does not seem very valuable and it consistently seems to cause nausea and vomiting. There is no evidence to suggest whether or not it is useful as an adjunct to antipsychotic drugs. In some cases Ayurvedic treatment may be more acceptable, and, for very poor people, more affordable than chlorpromazine. It is therefore a therapy option, but not one that has been shown to be clearly effective.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>No convincing differences are evident when comparing Ayurvedic medication with placebo or chlorpromazine and it may produce unwanted gastrointestinal effects. All trials are small and short but nevertheless do not really suggest any convincing clinical effect. It is possible that real effects do exist, or that Ayurvedic treatment may be useful as an adjunct to modern drugs. In any case, concurrent use of this ancient treatment may make taking modern drugs seem more acceptable and therefore be useful for people with psychoses.</P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>No direct data on hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care or economics are available. It is entirely possible, however, that in societies where Ayurvedic medications are more acceptable than modern drugs, they could be used to enhance acceptability of treatments such as chlorpromazine, which has effects on mental state, service use and quality of life.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the recommendations of the revised CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been anticipated by both authors and editors it would have helped to clarify methodology and outcomes. None of the included studies specified how participants were allocated to treatment. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid and gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to a minimum. Well described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. Intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least be presented in numeric form. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, 'p' values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value.</P>
<P>Failure to comply with the revised CONSORT statement, results in both loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians or patients (<LINK REF="REF-Tharyan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tharyan 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>We realise that data in this review are very few indeed. Studies on any means of use of this widely prescribed acceptable treatment are justified. However, we do feel uncomfortable with recommending a trial of Ayurvedic herbs or treatment versus placebo. Much more justified are trials using Ayurvedic herbs or treatments as an adjunct to treatment such as chlorpromazine. We suggest a design for one such pragmatic, real world, randomised controlled trial in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
