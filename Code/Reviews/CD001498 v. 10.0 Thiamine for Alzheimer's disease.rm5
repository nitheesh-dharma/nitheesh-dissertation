<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-05-06 15:04:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">Insufficient evidence of the efficacy of thiamine for people with Alzheimer's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Preclinical and laboratory studies show an effect of thiamine on the release and breakdown of acetylcholine. Some intellectual functions, including attention and memory, are influenced by neurons which release acetylcholine. Cholinergic function is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. It has therefore been hypothesized that thiamine may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical abnormalities in thiamine-dependent enzymes have been found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The three included randomized controlled trials totaled less than 50 participants and insufficient detail in the results did not allow combination of the data. Thus the review found no evidence of the efficacy of thiamine for people with Alzheimer's disease. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency plays an important role in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This is a form of brain damage occurring in long-term alcoholics who rely mainly on alcohol for nutrition. The acute syndrome (Wernicke's encephalopathy) is normally reversible. Progression to the profound amnestic syndrome (Korsakoff's psychosis) can be averted by a timely injection of a large dose of thiamine. There have been suggestions that thiamine may have a beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of thiamine for people with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 February 2003 using the terms thiamin*, vitamin-B1, B1, "Vitmain B1". This Register is regularly updated with records from all major health care databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) and many trials databases.</P>
<P>In addition the reviewers searched bibliographies of published reviews and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators to obtain additional data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with thiamine was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted the data independently by and estimated the odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences (95% CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three studies were included. The two cross-over studies did not report results from the first phase. It was not possible to pool any results for a meta-analysis. Nolan 1991 reports results that show no evidence of an effect on MMSE at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for thiamine compared with placebo for those who completed the trial. Meador 1993a noted that 3/8 on thiamine compared with 6/9 on placebo were worse as measured on the ADAS-Cog at 3 months compared with baseline, but the difference is not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Blass 1988 and Nolan 1991 reported that no significant side-effects were noted during the study, and Meador 1993a did not mention side-effects. Blass 1998 noted that 5/16 and Nolan 1991 that 5/15 did not complete the study, but neither mentioned the groups to which these people belonged.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It is not possible to draw any conclusions from this review. The number of people included in the studies is less than 50 and the reported results are inadequate.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-06 15:05:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Vitamin B1 (thiamine) plays an important role in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (a form of amnesia caused by brain damage occurring in long-term alcoholics who rely mainly on alcohol for nutrition). The acute syndrome is potentially reversible but may proceed to profound dementia. Its progress can be stopped by a timely injection of a large dose of thiamine (<LINK REF="REF-Kril-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kril 1996</LINK>). There have been suggestions that thiamine may have a beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mastrogiacoma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mastrogiacoma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mimori-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mimori 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two studies relating vitamins, particularly thiamine, to cognitive functioning. A study that compared the intake and functional levels of vitamins B6, C and thiamine, in 15 pairs of Alzheimer's disease and normal subjects, found a tendency for the Alzheimer's group to show lower vitamin B1 intakes than controls, despite both groups having a "normal" intake (<LINK REF="REF-Agbayewa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agbayewa 1992</LINK>). Another study found that taking long-term vitamin supplements may improve cognitive functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Benton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benton 1995</LINK>). In vitro studies of animal tissue suggests there is evidence of a link between thiamine and the presynaptic release of acetylcholine. Thiamine binds to nicotinic receptors and may exhibit anticholinesterase activity. The relationship of thiamine to nicotinic receptors and its effects on acetylcholine might be beneficial in patients with Alzheimer's disease because it is generally accepted that memory and some intellectual functions are mediated by acetylcholine.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only unconfounded, double-blind, randomized controlled trials of longer than one day were considered for inclusion. Trials in which the allocation to treatment or placebo was not random, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed were excluded.

<P>The reviewers manually searched bibliographies of previously published reviews and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators to obtain additional information.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>SELECTION OF STUDIES<BR/>A single reviewer (JLR) discarded irrelevant citations, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. If an article could possibly be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. There were no disagreements between the two reviewers.</P>
<P>
<B>QUALITY ASSESSMENT</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial. The quality of the methodology of each selected trial was rated using the methods described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralised randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (Intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of the treatment by: (i) use of a list or table to allocate assignments; (ii) use of envelopes or sealed envelopes; (iii) stating the study as randomized without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random number or assignments.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials are included if they conform to categories A or B, while those falling into category C are excluded.</P>
<P>Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by the scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and of the number of patients lost to follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>DATA EXTRACTION</B>
<BR/>Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by a third independent reviewer (JLA).</P>
<P>Data were sought on every patient with each outcome measure to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. </P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment period were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>DATA ANALYSIS</B>
<BR/>For continuous or ordinal variables (such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, functional and quality of life scales) the main outcomes of interest are the final assessment score (corrected for baseline) and the change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) to the final assessment. If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators perform suggested parametric tests are appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes such as institutionalisation, global impression and death, the endpoint itself is of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio was used.</P>
<P>The hypothesis to be tested was that thiamine has no effect compared with placebo.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK> describes two different experiments; the first experiment met the inclusion criteria, the second was excluded. All three studies were conducted in the USA, and all had fewer than 20 patients randomized. <LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK> is described as a pilot study. Two trials have a cross-over design, one of two months and the other of six months' total duration, and one with a parallel group design of one year's duration. All compare 3mg per day of thiamine, divided into three doses, with placebo.</P>
<P>Patients with probable or possible Alzheimer´s disease of mild to moderate severity were diagnosed using recognised criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA). The mean MMSE at baseline for the three trials was 14, 18 and 16, and the mean age was between 71 and 76 years. </P>
<P>The primary outcome in the three studies was cognitive function. Behaviour was assessed in one study. The studies included the following rating scales:</P>
<P>1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), evaluates cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall, and language. The test takes only 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal).</P>
<P>2. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>) comprises 11 individual tests, spoken language ability (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5), recall of test instructions (0-5), word finding difficulty (0-5), following commands (0-5), naming object (0-5), construction drawing (0-5), ideational proaxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), word recall (0-10) and word recognition (0-12). The total score ranges from 0-70, the high score indicating greater impairment. </P>
<P>3. The behavioural scale of Haycox (<LINK REF="REF-Haycox--1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haycox 1984</LINK>) uses information supplied by the carer.</P>
<P>4. The CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) neuropsychological battery (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1989</LINK>) includes a measure of verbal fluency, a short version of the Boston Naming Test, the MMSE, a constructional praxis test, a 10 item word list learning test, and a test of delayed recall .</P>
<P>5. The Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Blessed-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessed 1968</LINK>) consists of 6 sections . The first three sections measure changes in performance of everyday activities, habits and personality, interests and drive and are answered by the carer. The second three sections form a cognitive test.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>A cross-over design is not an appropriate design for a clinical trial where the disease being treated is progressive as is Alzheimer's disease. Results from cross-over trials cannot be used unless those from the first phase are reported separately. There is no mention of a wash-out phase for <LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK>, a cross-over study , and <LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK> does not have a wash-out phase between treatments. The proportion of drop-outs was not large especially considering the length of these studies, the age of the patients and the severity of their dementia.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Three studies could be included (<LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1991</LINK>). Two were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mimori-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mimori 1996</LINK>). Of the included studies, the cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK>) did not report results from the first phase. It was not possible to pool any results for a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1991</LINK>reports results that show no evidence of an effect for MMSE at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for thiamine compared with placebo for those who complete the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK> noted that 3/8 on thiamine compared with 6/9 on placebo were worse as measured on the ADAS-Cog at 3 months compared with baseline, but the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1991</LINK>reported that no significant side-effects were noted during the study, and <LINK REF="STD-Meador-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Meador 1993a</LINK> did not mention side-effects. <LINK REF="STD-Blass-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 1988</LINK> noted that 5/16 and <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1991</LINK> that 5/15 did not complete the study, but neither mentioned the groups to which these people belonged.</P>
