<P>
<B>What is the issue? </B>
</P>
<P>Babies who are born too early are more likely to become ill or die. If preterm labour is detected, treatment can start to slow down or stop labour. This also gives time for treatment to improve the baby&#8217;s breathing at birth. Increased contractions can be a sign of labour starting early.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important? </B>
</P>
<P>Many women do not recognise these contractions in time for treatment. Pregnant women at risk of giving birth early could use a monitoring device at home. This would send data to the hospital, and help doctors and midwives to detect and treat preterm labour.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find? </B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 28 June 2016 and found 15 randomised studies, involving 6008 women. Thirteen of these studies provided data we could use. The quality of results ranged from very low to high (GRADE). Most studies had design limitations, which in some were serious. Most studies compared women taught how to check for signs of premature labour with women who were also given a home uterine activity monitor. In some studies both groups used a monitor but one group had a &#8216;sham&#8217; monitor that did not actually send the data to the women&#8217;s healthcare providers.Using a monitor at home made very little difference to many of the outcomes for mother or baby, although not all studies measured all outcomes. Women using monitors were no less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 37 or 32 weeks of pregnancy (GRADE very low). Women using monitors were less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks, but when we analysed only high-quality studies, no clear difference remained (GRADE high). Babies born to women using the monitor were less likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (GRADE moderate) but there were no fewer deaths (GRADE low). Women using the monitor were more likely to make an unscheduled antenatal visit (GRADE moderate), but the number of antenatal hospital admissions did not differ (GRADE low). Women using monitors appeared to be more likely to receive tocolysis (treatment to stop labour) (GRADE low), but when we looked only at high-quality studies there was no clear difference. We found no data to assess women's views, although one large trial reported low compliance with monitor use. In some studies, women with monitors had more contact with midwives or maternity nurses, but it is unclear what effect this had.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean? </B>
</P>
<P>Home uterine monitoring may result in fewer admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit, but more unscheduled antenatal visits and treatment for preterm labour. The level of evidence is generally low to moderate.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risks of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We did not attempt to contact authors to resolve queries. We assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-08 11:05:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There were 15 included studies (6008 enrolled participants); 13 studies contributed data. Women using home uterine monitoring were less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; three studies, 1596 women; fixed-effect analysis) (GRADE high). This difference was not evident when we carried out a sensitivity analysis, restricting the analysis to studies at low risk of bias based on study quality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; one study, 1292 women). There was no difference in the rate of perinatal mortality (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.72; two studies, 2589 babies) (GRADE low).</P>
<P>There was no difference in the number of preterm births at less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85, CI 0.72 to 1.01; eight studies, 4834 women; random-effects, Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.03, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%) (GRADE very low). Infants born to women using home uterine monitoring were less likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; five studies, 2367 babies; random-effects, Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 32%) (GRADE moderate). This difference was not maintained when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01; one study, 1292 babies). Women using home uterine monitoring made more unscheduled antenatal visits (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.64; two studies, 1994 women) (GRADE moderate). Women using home uterine monitoring were also more likely to have prophylactic tocolytic drug therapy (average RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.45; seven studies, 4316 women; random-effects, Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.03, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%), but this difference was no longer evident when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias (average RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.65; three studies, 3749 women; random-effects, Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76%) (GRADE low). The number of antenatal hospital admissions did not differ between home groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; three studies, 1494 women (GRADE low)). We found no data on maternal anxiety or acceptability.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-08 11:06:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Home uterine monitoring may result in fewer admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit but in more unscheduled antenatal visits and tocolytic treatment; the level of evidence is generally low to moderate. Important group differences were not evident when we undertook sensitivity analysis using only trials at low risk of bias. There is no impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes such as perinatal mortality or incidence of preterm birth.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-13 11:58:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-13 11:58:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2001</LINK> considers various methods used to predict women at high risk of preterm labour, noting problems with sensitivity and specificity of traditional tests, and problems with accuracy of some biochemical and biophysical tests. Home uterine activity monitoring is one of the methods that has been used to try to predict preterm birth in the belief that early detection of increased contraction frequency would allow early intervention with tocolytic drugs to inhibit labour and prolong pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Maxwell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxwell 2001</LINK>). The rationale has been that many women do not recognise their contractions in time for tocolytic therapy to be applied to inhibit labour. No study so far has demonstrated that tocolysis has any role other than to allow time for the fetus to benefit from maternal steroid administration. One possible reason is that the tocolytic is being administered too late.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-08 11:10:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The various care packages developed to predict preterm birth include hospital admission to enhance clinical surveillance, and educational packages to help women identify the signs of early labour, with or without the use of electronic home uterine monitoring devices. Mothers are taught to use these devices at home for one- to two-hour periods each day, and the data stored in the device are transmitted by modem to a base centre for interpretation by a midwife or doctor, with appropriate response if the level appeared abnormal. The <LINK REF="REF-ICSI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICSI 2002</LINK> committee report found that home uterine activity monitoring was a safe procedure, but noted that its effectiveness was not proven. One of the identified difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of home uterine activity monitoring is the different types of care packages used, and the difficulty of assessing whether it is the home uterine activity monitoring or the increased nursing support that is responsible for the changes in outcomes. Existing randomised controlled trials have often used different control groups because such intensive monitoring may only be aimed at women deemed at risk of preterm birth, and the risk profiles may differ.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-08 11:15:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The rationale for home uterine monitoring was that early detection of uterine activity is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the onset of preterm labour, but studies (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Iams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2002</LINK>) suggest that the relationship between the maximum frequency of contractions and preterm delivery is weak. More recent research (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lau 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinken-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinken 2009</LINK>) on the electrohysterogram (EHG) indicates that it may be possible to distinguish physiological uterine activity from uterine contractions that will lead to preterm labour, but more computer modelling of uterine activation is likely to be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 2013</LINK>). Monitoring at home could allow mothers to avoid prolonged or additional hospital admissions, and to be cared for at home. On the other hand, some mothers might become more anxious during the monitoring, particularly if they were remote from hospital, and greater awareness might in itself lead to more frequent presentation at hospital. Reducing unnecessary hospital admissions may decrease antenatal healthcare costs but these savings could be offset by the increased costs associated with poor neonatal outcome.</P>
<P>The rationale for home uterine monitoring also requires that the tocolytic drugs that could be administered to prolong pregnancy are effective, but there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of long-term tocolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2011</LINK>). Various types of tocolytic agents exist. Cochrane systematic reviews indicate that the possible adverse effects of the betamimetics should be weighed against the advantages of delayed delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>), and that calcium channel blockers may be as effective as betamimetics but with fewer adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014</LINK>). Oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour are not advised (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2012</LINK>). The evidence on different dosing regimens for magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2015</LINK>) as single-agent tocolytic therapy is very limited. However, administration of magnesium sulphate to women considered at risk of preterm birth does reduce the risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2009</LINK>). Nifedipine and atosiban (an oxytocin receptor agonist) have comparable effectiveness but the latter is expensive and is only available intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2011</LINK>). The evidence on different dosing regimens for magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2015</LINK>) as single-agent tocolytic therapy is very limited. A Health Technology Assessment review of screening to prevent spontaneous preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Honest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2009</LINK>) concluded that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were the most effective tocolytic agents in reducing spontaneous preterm birth and prolongation of pregnancy in symptomatic women, but there were doubts over their safety and they are not in routine use. Antenatal corticosteroids helped reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage.</P>
<P>An overview (<LINK REF="REF-Piso-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piso 2014</LINK>) of Cochrane systematic reviews on antenatal interventions to reduce preterm birth noted that a few interventions have been found effective (e.g. progesterone for some groups of women, to improve infant health (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>)) and a small number appear harmful. For around half the interventions evaluated the evidence did not warrant recommendations for clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Piso-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piso 2014</LINK>). The accuracy of tests to predict preterm birth has been judged generally poor (<LINK REF="REF-Honest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2009</LINK>), although transvaginal cervical-length screening has been advocated as a means of identifying women at risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2015</LINK>). Fetal fibronectin testing and similar bed-side tests on cervical secretions have also been used for screening (<LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramoz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramoz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vis 2009</LINK>). Their benefit is that they have a greater than 95% negative predictive value for delivery within seven days, and studies have looked at combining transvaginal cervical-length screening with fibronectin testing (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Had_x017e_i_x002d_Legal-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Had&#382;i-Legal 2016</LINK>) with variable results.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-05 11:02:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There is a lack of consensus on the effectiveness of home uterine monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Reichmann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichmann 2008</LINK>). There are a number of reasons for this, including the variability in study design and the uncertain benefits of early detection of uterine activity. There were two aspects to be explored in the review: (1) is home uterine monitoring effective at detecting uterine activity? and (2) is it worthwhile finding out if women have uterine activity?</P>

<P>Two people screen the search results are screened and review the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (<LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, we searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 June 2016), Embase (1974 to 28 June 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 28 June 2016) (<I>See:</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>)</P>

<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random-number table; computer random-number generator);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcome, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that we would have expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses (see

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A>. We assessed evidence relating to the following outcomes for the comparison home uterine monitoring versus standard care.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Perinatal mortality</LI>
<LI>Preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation</LI>
<LI>Number of antenatal hospital admissions</LI>
<LI>Preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation</LI>
<LI>Admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)</LI>
<LI>Number of unscheduled antenatal visits</LI>
<LI>Use of tocolysis</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes, using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We have not included cluster-randomised trials in this review. If relevant for the next update, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6), using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and if we consider that the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We have not included cross-over trials in this review and do not plan to do so in future updates. This design is not relevant to our review question.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>We have included trials involving women with multiple pregnancies in this review. Where possible, we have analysed multiple pregnancy in subgroups (see analyses for the outcomes 'Preterm birth less than 34 weeks'; 'Preterm birth less than 37 weeks'; and 'Number of antenatal visits'), but only one study for each of the outcomes provided subgroup data.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-01-05 11:43:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we conducted analyses as far as possible on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes we knew to be missing.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-01-08 11:33:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect, i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and we judged the trials&#8217; populations and methods to be sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if we considered an average treatment effect across trials was clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, we present the results as the average treatment effect with a 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of Tau<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>

<P>Participants were women who had successfully been treated for preterm labour in the current pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nagey 1993</LINK>) or who were judged to be at risk (without prior treatment for preterm labour). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Blondel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Blondel 1992</LINK>) included both categories. The risk factors used in the studies varied. Some studies included twin and singleton gestations within the sample (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Blondel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Blondel 1992</LINK>), others specified that only singleton gestations were included (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1999</LINK>), others included twin and singleton gestations but separated the groups for analysis (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1998</LINK>), and one report (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1990a</LINK>) only studied twin gestations. Several trials focused on prenatal care for socially disadvantaged women, and two trials specified Medicaid coverage as one of the criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 1987</LINK>). Other criteria for inclusion include possession of a telephone, and ability to use the monitoring device. There were differences among studies between the number of those judged eligible on medical and social demographic criteria and those randomised. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>, a large 18-centre trial, 1355 women were enrolled and 1292 were randomised (95% of those enrolled). In a trial among 30 Kaiser Permanente clinics in northern California (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1998</LINK>), 3455 women were identified as eligible, 2480 were enrolled, and 2422 eventually randomised (to one of three treatment groups) (97% of those enrolled). <LINK REF="STD-Corwin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Corwin 1996</LINK> used the Creasy risk score; of those judged eligible (n = 509) on criteria including a Creasy risk score of greater than or equal to 10, 377 were enrolled and randomised (74% of those enrolled).

A fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Scioscia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Scioscia 1988</LINK>) provided no usable data. Of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nagey 1993</LINK>) that measured this outcome, two of them (contributing over 93% by weight) compared active versus sham home uterine monitoring. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>) provided data for those both randomised and monitored, and the authors state that the findings for the "subset who completed the protocol" were similar. If 36 women in a 1000 are likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>), then home uterine monitoring might reduce the number at risk to between 21 and 36.</P>
<P>However, in a sensitivity analysis, the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>: 72% contribution to this outcome) has low risk of bias for allocation, blinding, and selective reporting. The other two contributing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nagey 1993</LINK>) were at greater risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

Given the difficulties of assessing how many women were actually included in this study (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1993</LINK>), the figures presented are only a best estimate.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-08 14:48:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The trials were clinically heterogeneous. Risk factors for preterm labour were assessed differently, and the delivery of the home uterine monitoring intervention varied. Some trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Corwin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Corwin 1996</LINK>) used non-professional call centre staff to receive the transmissions sent by the pregnant women, while in others the contact was more active (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1990</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK> used a scripted protocol. There appears to be no consensus from these trials on the extent of professional midwifery support deemed appropriate. We do not know what the women thought of their care regimen in the trials where the centre staff receiving the transmissions only acted as conduits, giving no advice directly. It is possible that the lower withdrawal rates in <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1998</LINK> could be attributed to the more intensive and personal nursing or midwifery contact, but the organisational setting (a Health Maintenance Organization) for those two trials was different from the settings in the other trials. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 1987</LINK>) included costings, reporting the financial incentive in this case to reduce the number of hospital days associated with a preterm birth among pregnant women receiving Medicaid public assistance. Although a home uterine monitoring system might be appropriate for women in socio-economically disadvantaged groups, only <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1999</LINK> targeted this group, and other studies excluded those who could not speak English, or who did not have a telephone.</P>
<P>Many telemedicine trials assess the acceptability of the system to participants and providers, but none of the trials presented data directly on this, and only one related trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blondel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blondel 1990</LINK>) presents data on mothers' views of prenatal care with a home visiting system, with later overview of three trials involving home visiting. Arguably, the system architectures for home uterine monitoring involve choices between a) objective monitoring (checking up on education provided) or empowering women to monitor themselves, asking advice as necessary, or b) maintaining or enhancing participant contact (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 2010</LINK>). Analysis of the included trials provides few clues on the best way to implement a care delivery system, including how monitoring should be organised, although the topic has been considered (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Merkatz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merkatz 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included studies are based on the premise that increased uterine activity can be used as a predictor of possible preterm labour, and thus the effectiveness of home uterine monitoring as a screening tool is being assessed here. Pregnancy outcomes then depend on the effectiveness of the management of diagnosed preterm labour. Determining the contribution of home uterine monitoring to outcomes is therefore complex, especially in multicentre studies and studies in different countries and with different populations, where approaches to the management of preterm labour may differ. &#8216;Usual care&#8217; for control groups was not the same in all studies, and some authors set out to investigate the effects of intensive nursing care compared with, or combined with, home uterine monitoring. In most of the studies the women in the home uterine monitoring group also had daily contact with the nurses monitoring their transmitted results, but in, for example, <LINK REF="STD-Wapner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wapner 1995</LINK>, the daily nurse contact was withheld from the monitored group. The role of intensive nursing support was not the primary intervention being assessed in any of these studies, and although some authors have attempted to assess its role alongside, or instead of, home uterine monitoring, this is not possible from the data presented. The use of intensive antenatal care (from midwives and others) in the emotional and social support of pregnant women has been the subject of another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2010</LINK>) and demonstrates the difficulty of assessing the precise contribution of nursing care to pregnancy outcomes. The home uterine monitoring study authors who conclude that intensive nursing care may be as effective as home uterine monitoring and may provide other benefits for women at risk, are right to suggest that further targeted research in this area is required.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-08 14:52:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The main reason for downgrading the quality of the evidence was design limitations in the studies contributing data. In the studies that were not testing sham versus real home uterine monitoring devices, it would have been impossible to blind the participants to their allocation, and, depending on the way care was organised, some of the caregivers might easily learn the allocation. This could affect, for example, the use of tocolytic drugs. For objective outcomes, the fact that many of the trials scored 'unclear' for blinding is not a major concern.</P>
<P>One of the main difficulties with the meta-analyses conducted for the review was the low number of studies that contributed to any particular outcome measurement, and subgroup analysis for any outcome was only possible for one study within each outcome group. It was therefore impossible to clarify whether home uterine monitoring might be more effective for twin gestations, as considered in one review (<LINK REF="REF-Reichmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichmann 2009</LINK>). In addition, if we exclude studies at higher risk of bias from some of the meta-analyses there is no clear evidence of any difference between the experimental and control groups (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of perinatal mortality, the two contributing studies are of equal quality scores (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The inadequate blinding should not affect this outcome, but the quality of evidence is low (GRADE).</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of the number of preterm births at 34 weeks or less, the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>, 75% contribution to this outcome) is one of the higher-quality studies for allocation, blinding, and selective reporting. Relying solely on the findings from this trial very marginally reduces the size of effect. The overall quality of evidence is high (GRADE).</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, excluding the studies at high risk of bias from the meta-analysis of the data for NICU admission reduced the strength of the evidence of the difference between monitoring and control groups. Evidence for admission to NICU was graded overall as of moderate quality (GRADE). The analysis of the two contributing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1990a</LINK>) on unscheduled antenatal visits indicates that the monitored women made more visits, but another study (<LINK REF="STD-CHUMS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">CHUMS 1995</LINK>) which used the number of women as the unit of analysis indicates that there was no clear difference between the groups. We rated the evidence for the outcome of number of unscheduled antenatal visits as of moderate quality (GRADE). There were no group differences in the numbers of women admitted to hospital during the antenatal period, and we rated this evidence as low quality (GRADE).</P>
<P>In the analysis of the use of tocolysis, there was no strong evidence of effect when we excluded studies at high risk of bias from the analysis. Clinical protocols for use of tocolysis very likely varied from study to study. The overall quality of evidence is low (GRADE). Women using home uterine monitoring were not less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 37 weeks, and the quality of evidence was very low (GRADE). We cannot determine the role of tocolysis from these studies.</P>
<P>We selected outcomes that we considered best reflected the potential benefits and harms of home uterine monitoring. We included infant outcomes that were covered in a recently-published core outcome set for studies on preterm birth prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Van_x0027_t-Hooft-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van't Hooft 2015</LINK>). Our infant outcomes include those relating to gestational age at delivery (birth before 37, 34, 32 and 28 weeks' gestation), and we also included infant mortality and morbidity outcomes. Our key maternal outcomes relate specifically to home uterine monitoring: maternal anxiety, and acceptance of home monitoring rather than to more general maternal morbidity outcomes which form part of the core outcome set. We will consider including these outcomes in future updates.</P>

Important group differences were not evident when we conducted sensitivity analysis using only trials at low risk of bias. There is no impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes such as perinatal mortality or incidence of preterm birth.</P>

<P>The assumption that home uterine monitoring can help predict premature labour needs to be re-assessed. More research is necessary to identify a clinically useful remote monitoring system that is both closely linked to effective treatment to prevent preterm birth, and makes cost-effective use of professional nursing and midwifery staff. New studies and their outcomes and reporting should reflect current evidence-based obstetric practice.</P>

<P>Rosemary Currell and Christine Urquhart jointly worked on the protocol, with assistance from Liz Callow for literature searching and development of the search strategy. Francoise Harlow advised on the protocol and commented on the draft review. The idea for the review emerged from a systematic review of telemedicine (for the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) which identified a discrete set of studies on home uterine monitoring that were more suitable for consideration as a separate review for the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Both Rosemary Currell and Christine Urquhart were review authors on the telemedicine review.</P>
<P>Rosemary Currell and Christine Urquhart jointly worked on the 2014 and 2016 updates with contributions from Liz Callow (search strategy development) and Francoise Harlow (contribution to background).</P>
<P>Christine Urquhart is the contact author and guarantor for this review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-01-08 14:59:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We have updated the methods to reflect the latest <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's methodological guidelines.</P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that we intended to carry out the following subgroup analyses: singleton pregnancy; multiple pregnancy; gestational age at which home uterine activity monitoring (HUAM) began; type of HUAM used; reason HUAM was used. We planned to use the following outcomes: perinatal mortality and preterm birth less than 34 weeks. The studies provided only data on singleton pregnancy and multiple pregnancy, and only one study was involved. For this update, we added the following outcomes to the methods for subgroup analysis:</P>
<OL>
<LI>preterm birth less than 37 weeks;</LI>
<LI>respiratory distress syndrome;</LI>
<LI>number of unscheduled antenatal visits.</LI>
</OL>
