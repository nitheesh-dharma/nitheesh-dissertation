If so, which painkillers work best?</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>Pain is a common side effect of orthodontic treatment. The pain resulting from orthodontic treatment may differ depending on the amount of force applied and the type of braces used. It may also change over the first few days following treatment. Pain has been ranked as the worst aspect of treatment and is the most common reason for people wanting to discontinue orthodontic treatment. Painkillers, swallowed or applied directly to the sore areas of the mouth following treatment, are thought to relieve the pain, making brace treatment more comfortable and acceptable. These painkillers are often cheap, readily available, easy to use and do not cause serious side effects.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>Authors working with <A HREF="http://oralhealth.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Oral Health</A> carried out a review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 19 June 2017. This review includes 32 studies published from 1993 to 2016 in which 3110 participants aged 9 to 34 years (2348 of whom were included in the analyses) were randomly allocated to groups to receive:</P><P>1) painkillers versus no treatment,</P><P>2) painkillers versus a placebo (pretend or 'dummy' medicine),</P><P>3) one painkiller versus a different painkiller, or</P><P>4) a painkiller taken at different time intervals.</P><P>The severity of pain experienced by the study participants was compared. Nearly all the evidence was from adults who received oral painkillers versus no treatment, or one oral painkiller versus another oral painkiller. This evidence fell into two main groups:</P><P>1) adults receiving paracetamol; or</P><P>2) adults receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</P><P>A small amount of evidence also investigated the effect of local anaesthetic and opioids (tramadol).</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P><I><B>Analgesic versus placebo or no treatment</B></I></P><P>We found evidence that paracetamol, NSAIDs and local anaesthetic were effective at reducing pain intensity at 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours following orthodontic treatment when compared with either a placebo or no treatment group.</P><P><I><B>NSAID versus paracetamol</B></I></P><P>We found no clear evidence of a difference between the effect of ibuprofen and paracetamol for reducing pain intensity at 2 hours, 6 hours or 24 hours following either the placement of separators (between teeth) or placement of an initial aligning archwire.</P><P><I><B>Pre-emptive NSAID versus post-treatment NSAID</B></I></P><P>We found some very low-quality evidence that ibuprofen taken 1 hour prior to separator placement significantly reduces pain intensity 2 hours afterwards when compared to ibuprofen taken post-treatment.

Seventeen of the studies had more than two arms. We were able to use data from 12 trials in meta-analyses that compared analgesics versus control (no treatment or a placebo); nine that compared non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) versus paracetamol; and two that compared pre-emptive versus post-treatment ibuprofen for pain control following orthodontic treatment. One study provided data for the comparison of NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic.</P><P>We found moderate-quality evidence that analgesics effectively reduced pain following orthodontic treatment when compared to no treatment or a placebo at 2 hours (mean difference (MD) -11.66 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.15 to -7.17; 10 studies, 685 participants), 6 hours (MD -24.27 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -31.44 to -17.11; 9 studies, 535 participants) and 24 hours (MD -21.19 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -28.31 to -14.06; 12 studies, 1012 participants).</P><P>We did not find any evidence of a difference in efficacy between NSAID and paracetamol at 2, 6 or 24 hours (at 24 hours: MD -0.51, 95% CI -8.93 to 7.92; 9 studies, 734 participants; low-quality evidence).</P><P>Very low-quality evidence suggested pre-emptive ibuprofen gave better pain relief at 2 hours than ibuprofen taken post treatment (MD -11.30, 95% CI -16.27 to -6.33; one study, 41 participants), however, the difference was no longer significant at 6 or 24 hours.</P><P>A single study of 48 participants compared topical NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic and showed no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the interventions (very low-quality evidence).</P><P>Use of rescue analgesia was poorly reported. The very low-quality evidence did not show evidence of a difference between participants taking ibuprofen and participants taking paracetamol (relative risk (RR) 1.5, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). Nor did we find evidence of a difference between groups in likelihood of requiring rescue analgesia when ibuprofen was taken pre-emptively compared to after treatment (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.9).</P><P>Adverse effects were identified in one study, with one participant developing a rash that required treatment with antihistamines.

As clinicians we are often asked whether it will be necessary for patients to take painkillers during orthodontic treatment, and, if so, which are likely to be the most effective. Some studies have shown that pretreatment doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help to reduce the amount of pain experienced immediately after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Steen_x002d_Law-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Steen-Law 2000</LINK>). However, there is some uncertainty among orthodontists regarding which painkillers are most suitable and whether pre-emptive analgesia is beneficial.</P><P>We investigated relief of pain arising during and after the placement of orthodontic appliances (such as separators, fixed braces, removable braces and headgear) and during routine treatment to adjust appliances and replace archwires. We did not include pain relief following tooth extraction or surgical procedures associated with orthodontic treatment.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-05 15:19:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Orthodontics is the area of dentistry concerned with the growth of the jaws and face, development of dentition and relationship between dentition, jaws and face. It also involves treatment of teeth and jaws when they are irregular in their alignment, morphology or function. Typically, orthodontic treatment is carried out to improve the functioning and appearance of the teeth. This may involve moving teeth by applying a force via:</P><UL><LI>fixed appliances (braces that are attached to the teeth for the duration of the treatment);</LI><LI>removable appliances (braces that are normally worn full-time during treatment but can be removed for cleaning); and/or</LI><LI>functional appliances (removable or fixed braces that aim to move the teeth and modify the direction of growth of the jaws to induce an orthopaedic change) (<LINK REF="REF-British-Orthodontic-Society" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Orthodontic Society</LINK>).</LI></UL><P>Orthodontic treatment may also involve: extraction of teeth in order to provide space for other teeth to be aligned; surgery to expose unerupted teeth in an attempt to guide them into alignment; and, occasionally, jaw surgery to correct the underlying position of the jaws. Most people undergoing orthodontic treatment are children or adolescents, although an increasing number of adults are seeking treatment. (<LINK REF="REF-Buttke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttke 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Treatment typically begins with construction and placement of an orthodontic appliance (whether fixed, removable or functional) over two visits of 30 to 45 minutes each. Routine adjustments are then carried out every four to six weeks over the course of treatment, which normally lasts approximately 12 to 24 months. Following treatment, removal of fixed appliances takes approximately 30 to 45 minutes and retainers are then provided to maintain teeth in their newly aligned position.</P><P>Pain resulting from orthodontic treatment increases in proportion to the amount of force applied to the teeth. Different types of orthodontic appliances affect the intensity of the pain. Fixed orthodontic appliances seem to cause more pain than removable braces, or functional appliances, which are used to help modify facial growth (<LINK REF="REF-Sergl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sergl 1998</LINK>). Acute pain is experienced during or immediately after placement of separators. People may also experience pain for one to two days following each four- to six-weekly adjustment appointment. Pain may also be experienced acutely or continuously between adjustment visits. It is thought that the pain associated with orthodontic treatment is related to a reduction in the blood supply to the fibres that attach the tooth to the surrounding bone. This happens when a force is applied to the tooth via a brace. The reduction in blood supply causes inflammation and the release of several chemicals that greatly increase the transmission of painful stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Proffit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proffit 2000</LINK>).</P><P>Pain during orthodontic treatment has been shown to be the most common reason for patients wanting to discontinue treatment, and was ranked as the worst aspect of the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK> found that patients who underwent both premolar extractions and orthodontic tooth movement experienced more pain 24 hours after initial arch wire placement than 24 hours after tooth extraction. When separators (small rubber bands that make space for metal orthodontic band attachments around the back teeth) are placed between teeth, pain gradually increases, peaking the day after placement, and then decreases. By seven days, pain levels have decreased to the same level as at two hours following treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bernhardt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bernhardt 2001</LINK>). The amount of pain experienced depends upon the type of tooth movement occurring (tipping or bodily movement), and, in particular, the pain threshold of the individual. It is likely that patients only require drug-assisted pain relief for two to three days out of every four to six weeks, so the long-term implications of drug treatment are probably small.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-05 15:23:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Pharmacological management of pain involves the use of analgesics applied locally or systemically. These analgesics fall into four main categories:</P><UL><LI>opioids;</LI><LI>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);</LI><LI>paracetamol;</LI><LI>local anaesthetic.</LI></UL><P>The first three of these analgesics are commonly taken, systemically, within two hours of the orthodontic visit and can then be re-administered over a period of time until pain resolves. Local, topical NSAIDs and anaesthetic are also commonly used for the relief of traumatic ulceration caused to the oral mucosa as a result of irritation by orthodontic appliances. As a result, these topical forms of analgesia are more commonly used to relieve the symptoms of pain, rather than as preventive measures.</P><P>Analgesics for the relief of orthodontic pain are readily available, have a low cost, are easily administered and are generally harmless (in terms of a lack of side effects).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-05 18:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The mechanism of action for pain relief differs according to the analgesic being used.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Opioids</HEADING><P>Opioids, which are also referred to as narcotics, include codeine sulphate, tramadol and morphine sulphate. They may be classified as agonistic, agonist-antagonistic or partial agonist depending on their specific mode of action but they act on large A- &#948; fibres in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. They bind to G-protein-coupled opiate receptors on inhibitory fibres, preventing stimulus of the gate and therefore prevent pain transmission to the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Pleuvry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pleuvry 1993</LINK>). However, the specific mechanism of action differs slightly when considering tramadol. In addition to the mechanism described, tramadol can act to inhibit the reuptake of monamines, causing an analgesic effect, but limiting the osteoporotic changes seen with other opioids at a histological level. By acting in this non-opioid way, it has been hypothesised that the effect on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement will be less with tramadol than that experienced with other, traditional opioids; however, under experimental situations this has not been the case (<LINK REF="REF-Rashidpour-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rashidpour 2012</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs</HEADING><P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most popular method of pain control used during orthodontic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2007</LINK>). These include drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin, which function by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which modulates the transformation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid in the cellular plasma membrane (<LINK REF="REF-De-Carlos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Carlos 2006</LINK>). Prostaglandins are responsible for causing pain; inhibition of COX suppresses prostaglandin production and so reduces pain. However, prostaglandins, including PGE1 and PGE2, are important mediators of bone resorption, and it has been suggested that suppression of their activity with NSAIDs may affect the rate of orthodontic tooth movement (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kehoe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehoe 1996</LINK> found a significant difference in the rate of tooth movement achieved with elastic separators in guinea pigs when comparing treatment with misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue) or ibuprofen to a control group. However, the significance of this on a clinical level is negligible: there was a 1 mm average difference between intervention and control groups, and the doses used experimentally differed from those routinely used in practice.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Paracetamol</HEADING><P>Paracetamol, known as acetaminophen in the USA, has been available in the UK as an analgesic on prescription since 1956, and over-the-counter since 1963 (<LINK REF="REF-Shenoy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenoy 2013</LINK>). The primary mechanism of action of paracetamol is similar to that of NSAIDs. It is believed to inhibit COX, with a predominant effect on COX-2; however, unlike NSAIDs, it is thought to act at a central nervous system level rather than acting across cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Karthi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karthi 2012</LINK>). As a result, inhibition of prostaglandins is minimal and therefore it is thought that its use has no effect on the rate of tooth movement. However, although useful as an antipyretic and analgesic, it lacks an anti-inflammatory action and is therefore often used in combination with NSAIDs for management of pain.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Local anaesthetic</HEADING><P>It has been suggested that local anaesthetics, in the form of topical gels, might be safer alternatives to systemic analgesics as a method of pain management before or during orthodontic procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Shenoy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenoy 2013</LINK>).

For the purposes of this review, we analyzed VAS data relating to the primary outcome in millimetres. Therefore, for studies that recorded results in centimetres, we converted the data to millimetres. Most studies recorded this value on the basis of an overall summary of the participant's pain experience, however, some studies reported pain intensity for additional specified activities. Ten studies recorded pain intensity during chewing, biting, fitting front teeth together, and fitting posterior teeth together (<LINK REF="STD-Bayani-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Bayani 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernhardt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bernhardt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farzanegan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farzanegan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohli-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kohli 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Minor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ngan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelisson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pelisson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polat-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Polat 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polat-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Polat 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steen_x002d_Law-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Steen-Law 2000</LINK>).

These ranged from one hour pre-treatment to 30 days post-treatment. We analyzed data from 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours, as we felt these were the most important time points from a clinical perspective, in addition to being some of the time points reported most commonly across the studies. It was also evident from the data that the peak in pain intensity occurred at 24 hours, after which it rapidly reduced regardless of intervention and, therefore, we felt that analysing data beyond this point would provide little valuable information.

We considered this to be caused by clinical heterogeneity, such as individual variations in participant responses to pain, differences in orthodontic treatments, and different doses, classes and timings of the analgesics. We carried out further subgroup analyses, by orthodontic intervention, to determine if this was the cause of the heterogeneity. Our results showed that, although it did account for some heterogeneity, and reduced the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic to some extent in most cases, heterogeneity still remained. We did not feel that further subgroup analysis to try to account for this remaining element of heterogeneity, for example by reanalyzing according to timing of intervention, was appropriate due to the small number of studies.

However, unlike this review, they did not investigate the effectiveness at any time points beyond two hours.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-23 13:03:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-11-23 13:03:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is moderate-quality evidence that the use of analgesics reduces the pain associated with orthodontic treatment.</P><P>Due to a lack of evidence, we remain uncertain whether the systemic non steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are more effective than paracetamol, and whether topical NSAIDs are more effective than local anaesthetic, at reducing pain associated with orthodontic treatment.</P><P>There is very low-quality evidence that the use of pre-emptive ibuprofen, taken one hour before orthodontic treatment, significantly reduces pain up to two hours after treatment; however, the effect appears to reduce over time, with no evidence of a difference at six hours and beyond.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-05 16:24:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In view of the quality of the available evidence, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of different drugs, and whether taking an analgesic before treatment is effective.</P><P>The results of this review imply that there is a need for more long-term, well designed and reported randomized controlled clinical studies to assess the efficacy of drug interventions with relation to NSAIDs and paracetamol.</P><P>The design of future studies should consider the following.</P><UL><LI>Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria should be set, taking into consideration factors that can effect participant perception of pain, particularly gender.</LI><LI>An a priori sample size calculation should be carried out.</LI><LI>Presentation and analysis of data should be appropriate, especially for cross-over studies.</LI><LI>There should be adequate reporting of rescue analgesics taken by participants in each arm of the trial.
