<P>
<I>
<B>Background</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence is loss of urine when coughing, laughing, sneezing or exercising. Damage to the muscles that hold up the bladder may cause it. About a third of adult women may have urine leakage, and about a third of these may have problems bad enough to require surgery. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>When non-surgical methods, such as exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor (the base of the abdomen) or drugs, have not worked surgery is sometimes used to lift and support the neck of the bladder to help stop urine leaking. Needle suspension involves tying sutures between the vagina and the abdominal wall.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>The review found 10 trials, which studied 375 women having six different types of needle suspension operations and compared them with 489 women who received other treatments. Most of the trials were small or of poor quality, making their results less reliable.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Key results</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>More women were cured after abdominal operations such as colposuspension (84%) than after needle suspension (71%): both women who had and had not had a previous operation for incontinence. There was not enough evidence about complications, or how needle suspension compares with other operations. Needle suspension operations were not compared with conservative treatments such as pelvic floor exercises or drugs. In summary, needle suspension surgery appears to be less effective for urinary incontinence than abdominal surgery, and there is not enough evidence to compare it to other treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-24 14:12:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bladder neck needle suspension is an operation traditionally used for moderate or severe stress urinary incontinence in women. About a third of adult women experience some urinary incontinence, and about a third of these have moderate or severe symptoms. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) imposes significant health and economic burdens on society and the women affected.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-12-16 11:29:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 12 November 2014), and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-16 11:29:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 10 trials, which included 375 women having six different types of needle suspension procedures and 489 who received comparison interventions. Needle suspensions were more likely to fail than open abdominal retropubic suspension. There was a higher subjective failure rate after the first year (91/313 (29%) failed versus 47/297 (16%) failed after open abdominal retropubic suspension). The risk ratio (RR) was 2.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 2.72), although the difference in peri-operative complications was not significant (17/75 (23%) versus 12/77 (16%); RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.83). There were no significant differences for the other outcome measures. This effect was seen in both women with primary incontinence and women with recurrent incontinence after failed primary operations. Needle suspensions may be as effective as anterior vaginal repair (50/156 (32%) failed after needle suspension versus 64/181 (35%) after anterior repair; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16), but there was little information about morbidity. Data for comparison with suburethral slings were inconclusive because they came from a small and atypical population.</P>
<P>No trials compared needle suspensions with conservative management, peri-urethral injections, or sham or laparoscopic surgery.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-24 14:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bladder neck needle suspension surgery is probably not as good as open abdominal retropubic suspension for the treatment of primary and secondary urodynamic stress incontinence because the cure rates were lower in the trials reviewed. However, the reliability of the evidence was limited by poor quality and small trials. There was not enough information to comment on comparisons with suburethral sling operations. Although cure rates were similar after needle suspension compared with after anterior vaginal repair, the data were insufficient to be reliable and inadequate to compare morbidity. A Brief Economic Commentary (BEC) identified no cost-effectiveness studies comparing bladder neck needle suspension with other surgeries.</P>

<P>This is one of a series of inter-related Cochrane reviews of surgical approaches to the management of urinary incontinence: anterior vaginal repair (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>); suburethral slings (<LINK REF="REF-Rehman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehman 2011</LINK>); laparoscopic retropubic suspension (<LINK REF="REF-Dean-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 2006</LINK>); open abdominal retropubic suspension (<LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2012</LINK>); peri-urethral injections (<LINK REF="REF-Kirchin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirchin 2012</LINK>); and artificial sphincters. The reader is referred to one review in this series for a background description of urinary incontinence in women, the principal categories of incontinence and the broad approaches to management (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>). As well as surgery, these include medical (drug) and conservative (physical) approaches.</P>
<P>Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) constitutes a huge financial economic burden to the society. In the USA the annual total direct costs of urinary incontinence in both men and women is over USD 16 billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>), with a societal costs of USD 26.2 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1998</LINK>). Approximately, USD 13.12 billion of the total direct costs of urinary incontinence are spent on SUI (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>). </P>
<P>About 70% of this USD 13.12 billion is borne by the patients, mainly through routine care (purchasing pads and disposable underwear (diapers), laundry and dry cleaning). This constitutes a significant individual financial burden. Of the remaining 30% of costs, 14% is spent on nursing home admission, 9% on treatment, 6% on addressing complications and 1% on diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study in the USA reported that about 1% of the median annual household income (USD 50,000 to USD 59,999 in 2006) was spent by women on incontinence management. This study estimated that women spent an annual mean cost of USD 751 to USD 1277 (2006 USD) on incontinence. This cost increases with the severity of the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Subak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subak 2008</LINK>). The indirect cost associated exerts a social and psychological burden which is unquantifiable. (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, <LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2004</LINK> estimated that the annual average direct medical costs of SUI for one year (1998 USD) was USD 5642 and USD 4208 for indirect workplace costs. The cost of management and treatment of SUI appears to have increased over time due to increasing prevalence and increased desire for improved quality of life (QOL). This in turn has resulted from improved recognition of the condition, as well as increased use of surgical and non-surgical managements.</P>
<P>Surgical procedures to remedy urinary incontinence generally aim to lift and support the urethrovesical junction between the urethra and the bladder in order to increase bladder outlet resistance. There is disagreement, however, regarding the precise mechanism by which continence is achieved after surgery. The choice of procedures is often influenced by co-existent problems, a surgeon's specialty and preference, and the physical features of the person affected. Numerous surgical methods have been described, but essentially they fall into seven categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>open abdominal retropubic suspension (e.g. Burch colposuspension, Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz);</LI>
<LI>laparoscopic retropubic suspension;</LI>
<LI>anterior vaginal repair (anterior colporrhaphy) (e.g. Pacey, Kelly);</LI>
<LI>suburethral sling procedures;</LI>
<LI>bladder neck needle suspensions (e.g. Pereyra, Stamey, Raz);</LI>
<LI>peri-urethral injections;</LI>
<LI>artificial sphincters.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This review concentrated on needle suspensions of the bladder neck (referred to as 'needle suspension' in this review).</P>
<P>Needle suspension may be performed from a vaginal or abdominal approach. A long needle is used to thread sutures from the vagina to the anterior abdominal fascia. The sutures are looped through to the para-urethral tissue on each side of the bladder neck, thereby supporting it. There are three principal types (Pereyra, Stamey, Raz) and several modifications of each, such as site of initial approach (abdominal or vaginal), type of suture, site of attachment of the sutures, and the use of silastic spacers or Dacron sheaths to protect the suture from cutting through (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1996</LINK>). Cystoscopy (endoscopy), during or after the placement of the sutures, is used to check that the bladder has not been injured. The salient features are that the passage of the needle through the retropubic space is done blindly, and the support to the urethra is derived indirectly from the vaginal walls rather than directly to the urethra.</P>
<P>The wide variety of surgical treatments for urinary incontinence indicates the lack of consensus as to which procedure is the best. Guidelines using the available literature have been published, but were based on studies of mixed quality and type (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fantl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fantl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1997</LINK>). Provided that a sufficient number of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from consideration of all well-designed randomised controlled trials. Hence, there is a need for an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review of such studies, which will not only help to identify optimal practice, but also highlight gaps in the evidence base.</P>

<P>We selected the outcome measures used in this review on the basis of their relevance to the subjective cure or improvement of incontinence. We regard the principal measures of effectiveness as the proportion of women cured (continent or dry) following surgery, and the proportion of women whose symptoms are improved.</P>
<P>We adopted the recommendations made by the Standardisation Committee of the International Continence Society for outcomes of research investigating the effect of therapeutic interventions for women with urinary incontinence. These outcome categories include: women's observations (symptoms), quantification of symptoms, the clinician's observations (anatomical and functional) and quality of life.(<LINK REF="REF-Lose-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lose 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Relevant data could come from both history and questionnaire assessment, supplemented by the use of urinary diaries (including time and type of incontinence, frequency of micturition and voided volumes) and pad tests (quantitative estimate of weight of urine lost under standard conditions). This review also included other surgical information and adverse events as outcome measures.</P>

<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group. We identified relevant trials from the Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, which is described, along with the group search strategy, under the Incontinence Group's <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">module</A> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. The Register contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, <A HREF="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We identified randomised and quasi-randomised trials using the above search strategy. We excluded studies if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials for incontinent women. Excluded studies are listed with reasons for their exclusion. We resolved any differences of opinion related to study inclusion, methodological quality or data extraction by discussion with a third party.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of trials</HEADING>
<P>The review authors evaluated the reports of all possibly eligible trials for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion, without prior consideration of the results. Each review author independently assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Incontinence Group's assessment criteria, which include quality of random allocation and concealment, description of drop-outs and withdrawals, analysis by intention-to-treat, and blinding during treatment and at outcome assessment. We resolved any differences of opinion by discussion with a third party.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials and cross-checked the data. We sought clarification from the trialists for data that may have been collected but not reported. We subgrouped trial data by type of incontinence - either urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) based on a urodynamic diagnosis, or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) based upon a symptom classification. Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) was defined when either type of stress incontinence co-existed with detrusor overactivity, urge urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms. We used the International Continence Society terminology (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). In the event, however, all the included trials were limited to women with urodynamic stress incontinence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We processed the included trial data as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When appropriate, we undertook meta-analysis. We expressed outcomes as negative (i.e. failed rather than cured). For categorical outcomes we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR). For continuous variables we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference (MD). We used a fixed-effect model to calculate pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals. We only combined trials if the interventions were similar enough based on clinical criteria. When we suspected important heterogeneity from visual inspection of the results, we used the Chi² test for heterogeneity (at 10%) or the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If concern about heterogeneity persisted, we planned to use a random-effects model.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses included different diagnostic groups (i.e. USI, SUI or MUI), types of operations and groups with and without previous incontinence surgery. We would have carried out sensitivity analysis for individual methodological criteria if the data allowed (e.g. quality of concealment of randomisation), but the data were insufficient. For the purpose of the analysis, we considered the Burch colposuspension and Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz operations together.</P>

<P>We updated the first version of this review for Issue 2, 2004. We excluded a further four studies and included one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Palma-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1985</LINK>). In a subsequent update (Issue 2, 2006), we included another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Palumbo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Di Palumbo 2003</LINK>). We have identified no further trials since then.</P>
<P>Thus, we have now identified 10 randomised or quasi-randomised trials of surgery for urinary incontinence, which included needle suspension in one arm. They were conducted in six countries (UK, USA, Brazil, Greece, Italy and Croatia) and included a total of 864 women, of whom 375 had a needle suspension. Sample sizes ranged from nine to 289. We excluded a total of 11 studies because they were not randomised controlled trials, the women were not all incontinent or the surgical arms included other types of operations (<LINK REF="STD-Bump-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bump 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bump-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bump 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corcos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corcos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishenko-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ishenko 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koonings-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Koonings 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ramon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salinas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Salinas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vordermark-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Vordermark 1979</LINK>). We excluded one more study because no information was available from the authors to allow a decision to be made about eligibility (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 1995</LINK>), and another because it was a trial of prolapse treatment rather than needle suspension (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 2001</LINK>). Details are given in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Nine trials included only women with urodynamic stress incontinence (USI). In one trial women had mixed incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Palumbo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Di Palumbo 2003</LINK>); three specifically included women with prolapse (<LINK REF="STD-Athanassopoulos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Athanassopoulos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Palumbo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Di Palumbo 2003</LINK>), and only four were restricted to women who had not had previous incontinence surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1991</LINK>).

<P>We classed the Gilja operation as a needle suspension rather than an open retropubic colposuspension for this review.

The open abdominal retropubic suspensions were all described as 'Burch colposuspension' except in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-German-1992" TYPE="STUDY">German 1992</LINK>), in which a vagina/obturator shelf repair was used and another where the comparison was with Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (<LINK REF="STD-Palma-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1985</LINK>): we classed both as open abdominal retropubic suspensions for this review.</P>

Five compared a needle suspension with a Burch type of colposuspension; one was described as a vagina/obturator shelf repair (<LINK REF="STD-German-1992" TYPE="STUDY">German 1992</LINK>), and the other used a Marshall-Marchetti Krantz (<LINK REF="STD-Palma-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1985</LINK>). Two methods of needle suspension were combined for comparison with colposuspension in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>), although one of them could be regarded as a hybrid of a needle suspension and a colposuspension (termed as 'transvaginal Burch (Gilja) operation' by the authors).</P>
<P>Needle suspension was less effective than colposuspension, based on subjective outcome within one year of surgery (risk ratio (RR) for failure 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 2.60, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); and after the first year (91/313 (29%) failed after needle suspension versus 47/297 (16%) after open abdominal retropubic suspension; RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.72, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Athanassopoulos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Athanassopoulos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-1992" TYPE="STUDY">German 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mundy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mundy 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palma-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in peri-operative complications (haematoma, abscess, infection, pain, urinary tract infection, stitch removal for pain and Dacron sheath removal for infection) after needle procedures (17/75 (23%) versus 12/77 (16%); RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.83, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), which were reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Athanassopoulos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Athanassopoulos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-1992" TYPE="STUDY">German 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mundy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mundy 1983</LINK>). However, there was significant heterogeneity for this outcome (P value = 0.02, I² = 75%), which may have been due to an unusually low rate of complications after colposuspension in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mundy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mundy 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between the procedures for any of the other outcome measures, but the confidence intervals around these estimates were wide.</P>

<P>One trial compared Stamey needle suspension with porcine dermis sling (<LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1989</LINK>). This was a small trial with only 10 women in each arm. The women were unsuitable for open abdominal retropubic suspension (the author's preferred procedure) because they had vaginal narrowing secondary to either previous interventions or atrophic vaginitis. Although the trial was too small to address differences in cure rates, sling operations were associated with higher complication rates (9/10 versus 2/10) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>). These included pyrexia, blood loss, wound infection and pulmonary embolus, need for a permanent suprapubic catheter and more adjuvant therapy, and resulted in a longer stay in hospital (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>).</P>

However, while there were no significant differences in outcomes, the confidence intervals were wide, reflecting the small number of women in the trial (See <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-07-24 14:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of surgical operations for urinary incontinence and it should be viewed in that context (<LINK REF="REF-Dean-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirchin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirchin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehman 2011</LINK>). Amongst the trials that addressed the effects of needle suspension procedures for stress incontinence, the quality of the trials was poor (three of nine used quasi-randomised methods and all but one of the remainder did not provide details of the process of randomisation) and the numbers of women who participated were low. Long-term follow-up (five years) was only available in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Palumbo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Di Palumbo 2003</LINK>). Five of the trials included some women who had previous surgery for incontinence, and three included women with prolapse; however, data were not reported separately according to these subgroups.</P>
<P>Outcome measures were generally subjective and limited, with little evidence of reliability and validity. Only one of the trials reported that assessment of outcome was carried out by blinded observers. Patient satisfaction with, and acceptability of, the treatment were not addressed but are important factors in choice of management. No quality of life and mental health outcomes were reported (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelleher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelleher 1997</LINK>).. The cost-effectiveness of bladder neck needle suspension would be important to determine, given the health and financial burden of SUI. Nevertheless, searches for economics evaluations in this area have failed to identify any relevant studies. Should this procedure be considered for more than very occasional use it would be important that this deficit in the evidence based be rectified.</P>
<P>All trials included women with urodynamic stress incontinence only, therefore the effect in women with co-existing detrusor overactivity or urge incontinence (mixed incontinence) could not be assessed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Needle suspension versus open abdominal retropubic suspension</HEADING>
<P>Needle suspensions were less successful than open abdominal retropubic suspensions in terms of higher failure rates, although there were no significant differences in other outcome measures. This effect was seen in women with both primary and secondary (after failed primary continence surgery) incontinence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Needle suspension versus suburethral sling operations</HEADING>
<P>The one small trial that compared needle operations with slings included an atypical population who were unsuitable for more radical surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1989</LINK>). There were too few women to provide reliable data about cure rates. Although the sling operations were associated with more postoperative morbidity, the results cannot be generalised to the whole population having surgery because of the atypical nature of the women involved in the trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Needle suspension versus anterior vaginal repair</HEADING>
<P>Needle suspension appeared to provide similar cure rates to anterior vaginal repair in women with (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>) and without prolapse (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>), both in the short term and long term, but the numbers were small and clinically important differences could not be ruled out. However, the effects were of the order expected from a review of anterior repair (132/322 (41%) failed after the first year) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>). In the current review, 50/129 (39%) failed after anterior repair versus 46/128 (36%) after needle suspension. This suggests that needle suspension is as effective as anterior repair (but both are less effective than open abdominal retropubic suspension).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">One type of needle suspension versus another</HEADING>
<P>In one trial, using direct vision to attach the needle sutures did not significantly improve outcomes, but the numbers were too small to be reliable (<LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of sutures</HEADING>
<P>Polytetrafluoroethylene sutures (Gore-Tex<SUP>TM</SUP>) seemed to result in less postoperative pain in the medium term than polypropylene sutures, but the single study was too small to assess continence (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome of effectiveness used in this review was subjective report of failure to cure incontinence. Objective urodynamic outcome measures, for example change in functional urethral length or maximal urethral pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilton 1983</LINK>) were reported in four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Athanassopoulos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Athanassopoulos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1989</LINK>). These are measurable continuous variables, which allow trials with smaller numbers of participants to obtain relatively precise statistical estimates of any differences. However, they are of limited help in determining optimal treatment because they have no proven correlation with clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swift-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swift 1995</LINK>). Until accepted normal values, which correlate with clinical signs and symptoms, are available for these tests, they will not be included in this review.</P>
<P>Morbidity outcomes relevant to surgical complications (such as pain, voiding dysfunction, detrusor overactivity, entero-rectocoele, wound and urinary infections, length of stay and time to return to normal function) were not consistently reported. Such morbidity is of particular importance in decision-making when treating benign disease. Data describing treatment failure in terms of need for alternative interventions, or for repeat surgery for incontinence and prolapse, would be particularly useful.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-24 13:44:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limited evidence indicates that bladder neck needle suspension operations are worse than the open abdominal approach (retropubic suspension) for the treatment of primary or secondary urodynamic stress incontinence. However, data were inadequate for comparing morbidity. Although cure rates appeared to be similar after needle suspension when compared with anterior vaginal repair, the data were insufficient to be reliable. Comparison with suburethral sling operations was inconclusive because of the small and atypical population studied. There were no trials that compared needle suspension with conservative or other physical therapy or with self fixing slings or with laparoscopic retropubic suspensions or with peri-urethral injections.</P>
<P>Postoperative surgical morbidity was poorly reported, and quality of life measures and economic outcomes inadequately reported, therefore the alternative treatments could not be compared in other ways. In treating benign disease, morbidity must be balanced against the chance of cure or improvement in quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness of the options should also be considered.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-24 13:44:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research in incontinence should incorporate standardised, validated, preferably objective and simple outcome measures that are relevant to women who have incontinence, in order to allow comparison between studies. In particular, long-term morbidity, quality of life, and psychological and economic outcomes should be incorporated.</P>
<P>Surgical trials related to stress incontinence should systematically address surgical morbidity outcomes such as adverse peri-operative events, length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, de novo development of urge symptoms or detrusor overactivity, and especially the need for repeat surgery or alternative interventions. Long-term follow-up (at least one year, preferably five years or more) is essential for the proper evaluation of incontinence treatments.</P>

<P>July 2017 update: We have added Brief Economic Commentaries (BECs) to all of our 'Surgery for UI in women' Cochrane Reviews. We have revised the economic elements throughout the review; if incorrect, we have stripped them out. The previously used surrogate economic outcomes such as operation time and length of stay have been redefined as &#8216;Surgical outcomes&#8217;. We have added new economics-related text. This involved revisions to the Background section, Methods section, e.g. search section referring to added Appendix, Discussion section, Abstract and Plain Language Summary. We have added an appendix with details of the economics searches. The Conclusions section of the review has not changed. The rest of the review has not changed.</P>

<P>We performed additional searches for the Brief Economic Commentary (BECs). These were conducted in MEDLINE(1 January 1946 to March 2017), Embase (1 January 1980 to 2017 Week 12) and NHS EED (1st Quarter 2016). We ran all searches on 6 April 2017. We used two different search strategies on MEDLINE and Embase (OvidSP) and one on NHS EED (OVID). Details of the searches run and the search terms used can be found below. </P>
