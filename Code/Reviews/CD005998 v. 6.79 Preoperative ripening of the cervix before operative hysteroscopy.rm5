<P>Review question</P>
<P>Are cervical ripening agents effective for dilating the cervix before operative hysteroscopy and do they reduce the risk of complications during the surgery?</P>
<P>Background</P>
<P>Hysteroscopy is an operation in which the gynaecologist examines the uterine cavity using a small telescope (hysteroscope) inserted via the vagina and the cervix. Potential complications of hysteroscopy include cervical tears, formation of a false passage and uterine perforation. Cervical ripening agents are used with the aim of making it easier for the hysteroscope to pass through the cervix and reducing the risk of complications. Ripening agents include different types of prostaglandins (for example misoprostol and dinoprostone) which are administered either orally or vaginally. Osmotic agents are also used, and are administered vaginally. One osmotic agent is laminaria, a sea-weed based product. Cochrane reviewers assessed the evidence about different ripening agents. The evidence is current to August 2014.</P>
<P>Study characteristics</P>
<P>We included 19 randomised controlled trials (1870 participants) of premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopic surgery for a variety of conditions. They compared misoprostol with placebo or no treatment, dinoprostone, and osmotic agents.</P>
<P>Key results</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that misoprostol is safer and is more effective for cervical ripening than placebo or no treatment, and that is associated with fewer complications occurring during the operation, with lower rates of lacerations and false tracks. However misoprostol is associated with more side effects such as preoperative pain and vaginal bleeding.</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence that misoprostol may be safer and more effective than dinoprostone, and that it may be associated with fewer complications occurring during the operation. There is also low quality evidence that laminaria may be more effective than misoprostol. However, the possible benefits of laminaria need to be weighed against the inconvenience of its insertion and retention for one to two days.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The main limitations in the evidence were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. The evidence is current to August 2014.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-11 13:35:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hysteroscopy is an operation in which the gynaecologist examines the uterine cavity using a small telescopic instrument (hysteroscope) inserted via the vagina and the cervix. Almost 50% of hysteroscopic complications are related to difficulty with cervical entry. Potential complications include cervical tears, creation of a false passage, perforation, bleeding, or simply difficulty in entering the internal os (between the cervix and the uterus) with the hysteroscope. These complications may possibly be reduced with adequate preparation of the cervix (cervical ripening) prior to hysteroscopy. Cervical ripening agents include oral or vaginal prostaglandin, which can be synthetic (e.g misoprostol) or natural (e.g. dinoprostone) and vaginal osmotic dilators, which can be naturally occurring (e.g. laminaria) or synthetic.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 13:35:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In August 2014 we searched sources including the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of relevant articles. We searched for published and unpublished studies in any language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-06-04 10:44:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cervical ripening agents used before operative hysteroscopy in pre- and postmenopausal women. Cervical ripening agents could be compared to each other, placebo or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-04-22 20:03:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two review authors. The primary review outcomes were effectiveness of cervical dilatation (defined as the proportion of women requiring mechanical cervical dilatation) and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were mean time required to dilate the cervix, preoperative pain, cervical width, abandonment of the procedure, side effects of dilating agents and duration of surgery. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs). Data were statistically pooled where appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-23 10:36:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen RCTs with a total of 1870 participants were included. They compared misoprostol with no treatment or placebo, dinoprostone or osmotic dilators.</P>
<P>Misoprostol was more effective for cervical dilatation than placebo or no intervention, with fewer women requiring mechanical dilatation (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.16, five RCTs, 441 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence). This suggests that in a population in which 80% of women undergoing hysteroscopy require mechanical dilatation without use of preoperative ripening agents, use of misoprostol will reduce the need for mechanical dilatation to between 14% and 39%. Misoprostol was associated with fewer intraoperative complications (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.77, 12 RCTs, 901 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence). This suggests that in a population in which 3% of women undergoing hysteroscopy experience intraoperative complications without use of preoperative ripening agents, use of misoprostol will reduce the risk of complications to 2% or less.</P>
<P>When specific complications were considered, the misoprostol group had a lower rate of cervical laceration or tearing (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57, nine RCTS, 669 women, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence) or false track formation (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.97, seven RCTs, 560 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of uterine perforation (0.42, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.38, seven RCTs, 455 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, low quality evidence) or uterine bleeding (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.49, four RCTs, 340 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, low quality evidence). Some treatment side effects (mild abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and increased body temperature) were more common in the misoprostol group.</P>
<P>Compared with dinoprostone, misoprostol was associated with more effective cervical dilatation, with fewer women requiring mechanical dilatation (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.98; one RCT, 310 participants, low quality evidence) and with fewer intraoperative complications (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83, one RCT, 310 participants, low quality evidence). However treatment side effects were more common in the misoprostol arm.</P>
<P>Compared to osmotic dilatation (laminaria), misoprostol was associated with less effective cervical dilatation, with more women in the misoprostol group requiring mechanical dilatation (OR 5.96, 95% CI 2.61 to 13.59, one RCT, 110 participants, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between misoprostol and osmotic dilators in intraoperative complication rates (OR 5.14, 95% CI 0.24 to 109.01, three RCTs, 354 participants, low quality evidence), with only two events reported altogether.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The main limitations in the evidence were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-23 10:31:40 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hysteroscopy is an operation in which the gynaecologist examines the uterine cavity using a small telescopic instrument (hysteroscope) inserted via the vagina and the cervix. Hysteroscopy allows the diagnosis and treatment of submucous fibroids, polyps, scar tissue, and uterine abnormalities. Diagnostic hysteroscopy can be done under paracervical or local anaesthesia. However, operative or therapeutic hysteroscopy is usually performed under general or spinal anaesthesia. At operative hysteroscopy uterine polyps, fibroids, adhesions, or septum can be removed and endometrial resection or ablation can be done. In order to visualize the cavity adequately, the uterine cavity should be expanded with a distending medium such as a solution of glycine.</P>
<P>Possible complications of hysteroscopy include uterine perforation, bleeding, infection, damage to intra-abdominal organs, and fluid overload. In some cases fluid overload may occur, which can cause electrolytes imbalance and encephalopathy, and rarely death. The incidence of fluid overload is between 1.6% and 2.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Agostini-A-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostini A 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overton--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 1997</LINK>). The incidence of uterine perforation is 0.014%, and infectious complications account for 0.3% to 1.6% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2002</LINK>). Although rare, injury to internal organs can occur and this may require a laparotomy.</P>
<P>Difficulty in dilating the cervix is a complication that is infrequently discussed, despite the fact that almost 50% of hysteroscopic complications are related to difficulty with cervical entry (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2002)</LINK>. Potential complications include cervical tears, creation of a false passage, perforation, bleeding, or simply difficulty in entering the internal os with the hysteroscope (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loffer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loffer 1989</LINK>). Adequate preparation of the cervix prior to hysteroscopy may reduce these potential complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostrzenski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostrzenski 1994</LINK>). </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-01 16:04:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intrauterine pathology such as uterine polyps, fibroids, or adhesions can be treated using operative hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation or resection can also be performed by an hysteroscopic approach.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-23 10:31:40 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Difficulty in cervical entry and associated complications may be reduced by adequate preparation of the cervix prior to hysteroscopy. Cervical ripening agents include oral or vaginal prostaglandin, which can be synthetic (e.g. misoprostol) or natural (e.g. dinoprostone) and vaginal osmotic dilators, which can also be naturally occurring (e.g. laminaria) or synthetic.</P>
<P>Laminaria is made from the stem of brown sea weed (Laminaria digitata). Its dry form absorbs fluid from the cervix facilitating cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Ostrzenski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostrzenski 1994</LINK>). For insertion the patient is put in the dorsal lithotomy position, a sterile Cuscos speculum is applied and the cervix is sterilized using povidone-iodine solution. The Laminaria is removed aseptically from its package and grasped from its proximal end where the string is attached using Ring forceps. It is inserted into the cervical canal until it has passed the internal os with the string resting in the vaginal vault for easy removal (<LINK REF="STD-Darwish-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Darwish 2004</LINK>). Laminaria has the disadvantage of requiring insertion and retention for one to two days.</P>
<P>Prostaglandin vaginal suppositories (meteno-prost potassium or gemeprost), or intracervical sulprostone gel have been used as a cervical ripening agents before hysteroscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Hald-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hald 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1985</LINK>). Oral or vaginal misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, has been shown to be effective in cervical ripening among both pregnant and non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Nagi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oppegaard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Oppegaard 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preutthipan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Preutthipan 2000</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-12 16:37:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adequate preparation of the cervix prior to operative hysteroscopy may reduce the complications related to difficulty with cervical entry. Preoperative ripening agents are used to dilate the cervix before hysteroscopy.</P>
<P>In some cases mechanical cervical dilatation is required during surgery. In addition, preoperative use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) will create a hypoestrogenic state (medical menopause), thin the endometrium, and facilitate visualization of the endometrial cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Sowter--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sowter 2002</LINK>). Treatment with GnRHa will also reduce the size of uterine fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Girgoriadis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girgoriadis 2012</LINK>). However, similar to postmenopausal women, GnRHa treated women may have increased resistance to cervical dilatation due to the hypoestrogenic cervix (Thomas 2002a).</P>

<P>All studies reported intraoperative complications.</P>
<P>Overall, intraoperative complications were less common in the misoprostol group (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.77), 12 RCTs, 901 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This suggests that in a population in which 5% of women undergoing hysteroscopy experience intraoperative complications without use of preoperative ripening agents, use of misoprostol will reduce the risk of complications to between 1% and 4%.</P>
<P>When specific types of complication were considered separately, misoprostol decreased the risk of cervical lacerations and tears (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57, nine RCTS, 669 women, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence) and false track formation (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.97, seven RCTs, 560 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, moderate quality evidence).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-23 10:36:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, was superior to placebo in facilitating cervical dilatation, with fewer women requiring mechanical dilatation. It was also less likely to cause intraoperative complications. With regard to specific complications, cervical lacerations and false tracks were less common in the misoprostol group. There were too few data on uterine perforation or uterine bleeding to show whether there is any difference between the groups for these outcomes. Findings on cervical width were too heterogeneous to pool, but most studies reported a shorter time in the misoprostol group. Some side effects (preoperative pain, mild abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and increased body temperature) were more common in the misoprostol group. Findings on time to dilate the cervix and duration of surgery were inconclusive. In most studies abandonment of the procedure did not occur in either group.</P>
<P>Only one study compared misoprostol with dinoprostone. The findings favoured misoprostol for effectiveness of dilatation, risk of intraoperative complications, cervical width and time required to dilate the cervix. However the duration of surgery was about 3 minutes longer and side effects were more common in the misoprostol arm. Our other review outcomes were not reported in this study.</P>
<P>Misoprostol was compared with osmotic dilators, either natural (laminaria) or synthetic. Only one study reported effectiveness of dilatation (defined as need for mechanical dilatation). It found that women in the misoprostol group were more likely to require mechanical dilatation than women in the laminaria group. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the rate of intraoperative complications or time taken to dilate the cervix, and findings for cervical width were inconsistent. Other review outcomes were not reported. Clinicians would need to balance the possible benefit of laminaria for cervical dilation and the inconvenience of its insertion and retention for one to two days.</P>
<P>In summary, this review suggests that misoprostol (a synthetic prostaglandin) is preferable to placebo for cervical ripening before operative hysteroscopy. It facilitates cervical dilation and decreases the risk of cervical tears and the formation of a false passage. However, it is associated with treatment side effects including mild abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and vaginal bleeding. Osmotic dilators are an option for women with contraindications to prostaglandins.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-12 17:31:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven of the 19 included studies reported our primary effectiveness outcome (effectiveness of cervical dilatation), though some of our secondary measures of effectiveness were limited by heterogeneity between the studies which precluded statistical pooling. All studies reported our primary safety outcome (intraoperative complications) and most studies reported on side effects associated with treatment.</P>
<P>The evidence appears to be applicable to women undergoing operative hysteroscopy for any condition, as the indications for operative hysteroscopy in the included studies included: uterine septae, synechiae, submucous myomas, endometrial polyps and endometrial ablation. More evidence is needed on variables such as the specific doses, intervals, and routes of administration used for these agents.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-12 12:07:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence for comparisons in this review varied from low to moderate. The main limitations in the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of study methods and statistical heterogeneity which precluded statistical pooling for most of the continuous outcomes. Two of the studies failed to provide data suitable for analysis.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-12 17:49:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted this systematic review according to a protocol developed following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration; the protocol was published before conducting the full review. We systematically searched a number of databases and reference lists for randomised clinical trials, which should have reduced the selection bias to a minimum. Two authors selected trials and extracted data in duplicate, independent of each other. We conducted analyses according to the different interventions.</P>
<P>Where a study compared multiple doses or routes of misoprostol to a control group, we analysed the data as one group regardless of the misoprostol dose or route. In accordance with statistical advice, we calculated the mean by multiplying the mean for each group by the number of women per group, adding the numbers, and then dividing by the total number of women. The same approach was used for the SDs. We acknowledge that this approach provides an estimate only, as there is will be no way to obtain the accurate data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-11 13:49:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review is generally in agreement with other systematic reviews.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gkrozou-F-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gkrozou F 2011</LINK> in their systematic review evaluated the use of vaginal misoprostol before diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy. Misoprostol reduced the need for cervical dilatation in the total population of pre- and postmenopausal women. In the subgroup of operative hysteroscopy the need for dilatation and the duration of the procedure were also reduced. Side effects occurred more frequently in the misoprostol group than in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Polyzos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polyzos 2012</LINK> reported in his systematic review on the use of misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy (diagnostic or operative) that misoprostol appears to facilitate an easier and uncomplicated procedure in premenopausal women but not postmenopausal women.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-23 10:38:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that use of misoprostol for preoperative ripening of the cervix before operative hysteroscopy is more effective than placebo or no treatment and is associated with fewer intraoperative complications such as lacerations and false tracks. However misoprostol is associated with more side effects, including preoperative pain and vaginal bleeding.</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence to suggest that misoprostol has fewer intraoperative complications and is more effective than dinoprostone.</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence to suggest that laminaria may be more effective than misoprostol, with uncertain effects for complication rates. However the possible benefits of laminaria need to be weighed against the inconvenience of its insertion and retention for one to two days.</P>
<P>Clinicians should inform women of the common side effects of misoprostol, including mild abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, and provide them with appropriate preoperative analgesia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-12 12:09:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is needed on the optimal dose and interval of misoprostol, route of administration, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects. Studies should be stratified by menopausal status. Only large randomised trials will have the power to detect clinically important and patient-oriented outcomes.</P>

<P>105 women were assigned to 2 groups using a computer-generated randomisation table. </P>
<P>In the study group (n = 51) 400 micrograms of misoprostol was inserted in the posterior vaginal fornix at least 12 h before hysteroscopy. No patient received any cervical ripening agent prior to surgery in the control group (n = 54). </P>
<P>The hysteroscopy was performed under general anaesthesia by 2 investigators. Cervical dilation was performed using successively larger Hegar dilators until resistance was met. Cervical width was reported as 1 size smaller as the final Hegar dilator used. Further, cervix was dilated to Hegar No. 8.5 for diagnostic purposes and minor operative procedures, and to Hegar No. 10 for hysteroscopic resection of fibroids. An 8mm hysteroscope was used and the uterine cavity distended with normal saline solution. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity and parity, number of menopausal women, and number of years after menopause. None of the menopausal women were taking hormone therapy. The number of women who had previous cervical dilation and cervical surgery and the indications for hysteroscopy were also similar in the 2 groups.</P>

<P>In the laminaria group (n=59), patients received a single laminaria tent (Mizutani Laminana Inc., Nagoya, Japan) about 3 mm in diameter 12 hours before operative hysteroscopy. In the misoprostol group (n=58), patients were given 400 microgram of misoprostol (Orally Cytotec; Pharmacia Corp, Chicago, Illinois) 12 and 24 hours before operative hysteroscopy. No patients were given any analgesics to compare the pain intensity associated with cervical priming. All operative hysteroscopies were performed by the same surgeon (YR. Lin). Patients received intravenous general anaesthesia with propofol, or in those with submucous leiomyoma, endotracheal general anaesthesia. After the patients were anaesthetized, residents in training prepared the patients, including disinfection and draping, and the surgeon was summoned to perform the hysteroscopy. The hysteroscopist was blinded to the priming method. Hegar dilators (Atom Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan.) were introduced through the cervical os starting with No. I and followed by increasingly larger dilators until resistance was encountered. Postpriming cervical width was defined as the smallest dilator that passed with resistance. Operative hysteroscopies were performed using a 22F resectoscope (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a sheath diameter of 7 mm. A 5% glucose solution was used for uterine distention and irrigation. No complications occurred during cervical dilation or hysteroscopic surgeries.<BR/>Patients were given a questionnaire to record any adverse effects including pain after cervical priming.
