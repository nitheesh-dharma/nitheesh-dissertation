<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-05 21:48:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alex J Shortt">
<P>Myopia is the term used to describe short or near-sightedness, which means that you cannot see objects in the distance clearly. Most people with myopia wear spectacles or contact lenses. Glasses can be uncomfortable and are not practical for sport; contact lenses can be associated with corneal infections. For these reasons, some people choose to have surgery for myopia. Two commonly used surgical techniques are LASIK and PRK. Both these procedures use laser to remove corneal tissue and reshape the cornea. This review analyses the results from 13 clinical trials where 1923 eyes of 1135 participants were randomly treated with either LASIK or PRK. We considered the overall quality of evidence from these studies to be low. There was some evidence that LASIK gives a faster visual recovery than PRK, and is a less painful technique, although visual results one year after surgery were comparable. Surgical techniques are improving all the time and further trials are needed to see whether LASIK and PRK, as currently practised, are equally safe.</P>

Nine of these trials randomised eyes to treatment, two trials randomised people to treatment and treated both eyes, and two trials randomised people to treatment and treated one eye. None of the paired trials reported an appropriate paired analysis. We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for most outcomes because of the risk of bias in the included trials. There was evidence that LASIK gives a faster visual recovery than PRK and is a less painful technique. Results at one year after surgery were comparable: most analyses favoured LASIK but they were not statistically significant. </P>

<P>LASIK gives a faster visual recovery and is a less painful technique than PRK. The two techniques appear to give similar outcomes one year after surgery. Further trials using contemporary techniques are required to determine whether LASIK and PRK as currently practised are equally safe. Randomising eyes to treatment is an efficient design, but only if analysed properly. In future trials, more efforts could be made to mask the assessment of outcome.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-22 13:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Myopia (also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness) is an ocular condition in which the refractive power of the eye is greater than is required. The main determinants of refraction are the focusing power of the cornea and crystalline lens and the length of the eye. In myopia light from distant objects is focused in front of the retina instead of on it. This occurs because the corneal curvature is too strong or the eye is too long. As a result objects in the distance appear blurred. Near objects appear less blurred or may be seen clearly depending on the degree of myopia. People with myopia can be classified into two groups, those with low to moderate myopia (0 to &lt; -6 dioptres) and those with moderate to high myopia (greater than -6 dioptres) (<LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of myopia varies with age, country, ethnic group, level of education and occupation. The prevalence of myopia in Western populations is estimated to be approximately 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Kempen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorsby-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorsby 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sperduto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sperduto 1983</LINK>). In some Asian populations myopia prevalence is as high as 70% to 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2000</LINK>). According to epidemiological evidence the prevalence of myopia is increasing, especially in Asian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Rajan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tay-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tay 1992</LINK>). Most cases of myopia present in children of school age and young adults. The presenting complaint is difficulty reading objects at a distance and diagnosis is based on the results of refraction (spectacle testing). The exact cause of myopia is not yet clear, however there is substantial evidence that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrick 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutti 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-22 13:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The most commonly used methods for correcting myopia are spectacle correction and contact lens wear. These conservative optical methods provide temporary correction. They each have functional limitations such as the problems encountered in wearing spectacles when showering or playing sports and the inconvenience of carrying contact lens solutions and storage containers, or obtaining them in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Wearing contact lenses is not without risk as it has been shown to increase the risk of sight-threatening corneal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Dart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foulks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulks 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical procedures have been developed in an attempt to permanently correct myopia. These procedures involve an operation on either the cornea (corneal refractive procedures) or lens of the eye (lenticular refractive procedures) and work by reducing the focusing power of the cornea or lens respectively.</P>
<P>Corneal refractive procedures used to correct myopia include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>excimer laser refractive surgery: this is divided into two main procedure groups, 'surface treatments' and 'flap treatments';</LI>
<UL>
<LI>In surface treatments, the skin on the surface of the cornea is removed by physical scraping or peeling and the laser is applied to the surface of the main body of the cornea, known as the stroma. The laser corrects the shape of the corneal stroma and therefore abolishes myopia. The surface skin can be left to heal naturally with the aid of a contact lens (as in PRK) or the removed dead skin can be replaced and may act like a bandage whilst new skin regenerates below it, as in laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) or epipolis (Greek for surface) LASIK which is also known as EpiLASIK. All of these are categorised as surface treatments.</LI>
<LI>Flap treatments use a blade or a femtosecond laser to cut a thin flap on the surface of the cornea. This flap is peeled back and the excimer laser is applied within the body of the corneal stroma. The flap is replaced at the end of the procedure. This flap treatment is called laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK). A recent variant of LASIK is sub-Bowmans keratomileusis (SBK) which differs from LASIK only in that the thickness of the flap is substantially less. Hence SBK is also referred to as 'thin-flap LASIK'.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>incisional procedures: radial keratotomy or astigmatic keratotomy (a blade is used to make cuts in the cornea to alter its shape);</LI>
<LI>tissue and synthetic implants: epikeratophakia, keratophakia and intracorneal rings (in these techniques human corneal tissue or synthetic devices are inserted into the cornea to change its shape).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Lenticular refractive procedures used to correct myopia include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>clear lens extraction with or without intraocular lens insertion (this operation is identical to cataract surgery and is also called refractive lens exchange);</LI>
<LI>phakic intraocular lens insertion.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-22 13:42:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The two most commonly used surgical techniques to correct myopia are PRK and LASIK. Both these techniques use the ophthalmic excimer laser to remove corneal tissue and reshape the cornea thus reducing its refractive power. The number of PRK and LASIK procedures being performed has rapidly increased over the last 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Leaming-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaming 2004</LINK>). These interventions are performed on healthy eyes and the vast majority of patients are under 60 years of age. It is important that patients are informed about and understand the effectiveness, limitations, safety, complications and relative merits of these procedures.</P>
<P>PRK was the first technique to employ the ophthalmic excimer laser for correction of myopia (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munnerlyn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munnerlyn 1988</LINK>). Later Pallikaris et al described laser in-situ keratomileusis, which is now widely known as LASIK (<LINK REF="REF-Pallikaris-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallikaris 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pallikaris-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallikaris 1991</LINK>). PRK gained FDA approval before LASIK and was initially more widely performed; but LASIK uptake grew rapidly in the late 1990s and LASIK quickly became the dominant method of laser refractive correction for myopia. This shift was not based on any clear evidence of a superior visual outcome for LASIK but rather upon other factors such as those summarised in reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2010</LINK>:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>earlier post-treatment stabilisation of visual acuity;</LI>
<LI>less post-treatment patient discomfort;</LI>
<LI>faster improvement in visual acuity;</LI>
<LI>possibly improved predictability and stability;</LI>
<LI>less stromal haze formation;</LI>
<LI>easier enhancement procedure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The most feared outcome of either procedure is loss of vision, specifically loss of best-corrected vision. In PRK this is most likely to occur due to corneal haze (an inflammatory reaction of the cornea to treatment). Mitomycin C (MMC) is a chemotherapy agent which when applied to the cornea following PRK may reduce the risk of this complication in high-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). Corneal haze is rare following LASIK (<LINK REF="STD-SUMMIT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SUMMIT 1998</LINK>) but complications arising from the creation of a flap can result in loss of best-corrected vision (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stulting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stulting 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK>). When managed appropriately the refractive and visual outcomes following flap complications are comparable to those in uncomplicated cases (<LINK REF="REF-Ito-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2005</LINK>). Corneal ectasia, a distortion of the shape of the cornea, is another rare but potentially serious complication of LASIK (<LINK REF="REF-Chuck-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuck 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pallikaris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallikaris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Randleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randleman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK>). Careful screening of patients preoperatively for risk factors such as high myopia, forme fruste keratoconus and low residual stromal thickness post-treatment is important to minimise the risk (<LINK REF="REF-Randleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randleman 2003</LINK>). There have been concerns about the long-term stability of laser refractive surgery. While individual cases of regression (the eye becoming long- or short-sighted again following an initially successful treatment) can occur, data from studies demonstrates that overall the outcome of both LASIK and PRK remains stable in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Dirani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dirani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Doherty-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Doherty 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sekundo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sekundo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The initial version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Shortt-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortt 2006a</LINK>) was the first systematic review comparing LASIK and PRK. The data available at that time confirmed that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>visual recovery is faster following LASIK than PRK;</LI>
<LI>final uncorrected visual acuity may be superior following LASIK but the result was sensitive to exclusion of a large study which was at high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>there is no difference in post-treatment refraction (accuracy) between LASIK and PRK;</LI>
<LI>LASIK is safer in that it resulted in fewer eyes losing 2 or more lines of visual acuity than PRK.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Since this review was first published there have been two major changes in the way LASIK and PRK are performed. Firstly, contemporary PRK and LASIK treatments are invariably wavefront-guided whereas the studies included in the original review were not. This means that the laser uses a more detailed set of data about an eye to create a customised pattern of laser treatment specifically tailored to that eye. In theory this should result in more accurate treatments and superior outcomes although the results of studies are inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis showed no clear evidence of a benefit of wavefront-guided over non-wavefront-guided ablations (<LINK REF="REF-Fares-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fares 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The second major shift in practice is in the method of flap creation in LASIK which can be achieved using a mechanical microkeratome or the more recently developed femtosecond laser. The rate of intraoperative flap complications using a mechanical microkeratome is approximately 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stulting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stulting 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK>) and for the femtosecond laser is approximately 3% (<LINK REF="STD-Moshirfar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Moshirfar 2010</LINK>). The thickness of a microkeratome LASIK flap is in the order of 150 to 180 microns whereas a femtosecond laser flap is approximately 90 to 110 microns and is more predictable (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2010</LINK>). It is postulated that as a result the biomechanical properties of the cornea following SBK are equivalent to those following PRK (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2008</LINK>). Femtosecond lasers also cause less epithelial injury (<LINK REF="STD-Moshirfar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Moshirfar 2010</LINK>). There is some evidence that femtosecond laser flaps result in better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) postoperatively than mechanical microkeratomes (<LINK REF="REF-Durrie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durrie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2005</LINK>), however a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing microkeratome and femtosecond laser flap creation for LASIK did not show any difference in efficacy, accuracy and safety measures in the early and mid-term follow-up, although it was found that femtosecond flaps may induce fewer aberrations (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This updated version of the review includes data from trials that use these newer technologies and re-evaluates the evidence for the relative efficacy and safety of these procedures.</P>

<P>We only considered trials in which the participants were men and women over 18 years of age and under 60 years of age undergoing laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for any degree of myopia. Sub-Bowmans keratomileusis (SBK) is considered as sufficiently similar to LASIK that data from trials comparing SBK and PRK are included. Participants under 18 years of age were excluded due to the frequent change in refractive error still occurring in this age group. Participants over 60 years of age were excluded on the basis that some degree of cataract is observed in many of these people and corneal refractive procedures will not correct aberrations or reduced visual acuity caused by cataract.</P>
<P>As most people with myopia have some degree of astigmatism this review included individuals with up to 3 dioptres (D) of myopic astigmatism. People undergoing treatment for correction of refractive errors other than primary myopia, for example post corneal graft, were excluded, as were people with any other co-existing ocular disease or any systemic disease that is associated with abnormal or impaired wound healing.</P>

<P>Ideally studies that randomly allocated eyes to treatment should report a paired analysis. In the event, none of the paired studies included in this review did the analysis appropriately. This meant that it was not possible to calculate the intra-class correlation coefficient and adjust the analyses accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). The analyses therefore assume that the response of any eye to one treatment is not related to the response of the fellow eye.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants in all trials were men and women aged 18 or over with stable refraction for one year or more. Exclusion criteria included previous refractive or other ocular surgery, central corneal thickness of less than 490 microns by ultrasound pachymetry, keratoconus or suspected keratoconus on corneal topography, active ocular disease, dry eyes and systemic diseases likely to affect corneal wound healing (for example, connective tissue disease). The range of myopia treated varied between studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>All eyes underwent LASIK or PRK as a day case procedure under topical anaesthesia.</P>
<P>The surgical procedure used to perform PRK was standard between studies. Mitomycin C (MMC) was used as an adjunct to prevent post-PRK corneal haze in some contemporary studies. The LASIK technique varied widely. Flap creation was performed using a microkeratome in early studies whereas in contemporary studies this was performed using the femtosecond laser. The excimer laser manufacturer varied between studies but not within studies. Treatment nomograms varied between studies as did the target refraction although in the majority of trials the target refraction was emmetropia. From 2008 onwards, both PRK and LASIK were performed using wavefront-guided technology. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> summarises the techniques used in each study.</P>

<P>Four trials reported UCVA 20/15 or better two to four weeks after treatment (n = 566) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). All four trials reported that more participants treated with laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) achieved this very good vision compared to people treated with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) (pooled odds ratio 5.89 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.34, 10.39). This pooled odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of 3.30 (95% CI 2.43 to 4.15) assuming a risk of 0.16 in the PRK group (based on median risk in the included studies).</P>
<P>Five trials reported UCVA 20/15 or better six months after treatment (n = 682) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). All five trials provided effect estimates consistent with LASIK or PRK being more effective (confidence intervals included 1) and the pooled odds ratio was 1.13 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.69). This pooled odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.08 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.35) assuming a risk of 0.36 in the PRK group (based on median risk).</P>
<P>Two trials reported UCVA 20/15 or better at 12 months after treatment (n = 372) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The pooled odds ratio was 1.08 (95% CI 0.58 to 2.00) The risk ratio was 1.01 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) assuming a control group risk of 0.87.</P>

All eight trials reported that more participants treated with LASIK achieved this very good vision compared to people treated with PRK (pooled odds ratio 3.69, 95% CI 2.55 to 5.36).This pooled odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.85 (95% CI 1.62 to 2.05) assuming a risk of 0.37 in the PRK group (based on median risk).</P>
<P>Ten trials reported UCVA 20/20 or better six months after treatment (n = 1113) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Five trials found more people receiving LASIK achieved 20/20 or better, four trials found more people receiving PRK achieved this good vision, and one trial found no difference. However, for nine out of 10 of these trials the confidence intervals included 1 and therefore the results were consistent with greater beneficial effect of either LASIK or PRK. The pooled odds ratio was 1.41 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.00). This pooled odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.06 (95% CI 1 to 1.10) assuming a risk of 0.82 in the PRK group (based on median risk).</P>
<P>Seven trials reported UCVA 20/20 or better at 12 months after treatment (n = 1007) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Five out of these seven trials found in favour of LASIK and the pooled odds ratio was 1.64 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.45). This pooled odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.17 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.29) assuming a risk of 0.63 in the PRK group (based on median risk).</P>

There was substantial heterogeneity in the results (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%). Results ranged from an odds ratio of 0.26 in favour of PRK (<LINK REF="STD-Hjortdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hjortdal 2005</LINK>) to an odds ratio of 7.07 in favour of LASIK (<LINK REF="STD-Manche-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Manche 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eight trials reported this outcome at six months after treatment (n = 567) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Again individual study results were variable but there was no statistical evidence of inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and the pooled odds ratio was 1.11 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.67).

<P>In <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK> the studies are divided up into those recruiting patients with different degrees of myopia. We divided studies into those treating low to moderate myopia (0 to -6 D) or moderate to high myopia (- 6 D to -15 D). In general there was no strong statistical evidence of any major differences in effect between LASIK and PRK at different levels of myopia. The exception was mean spherical equivalent at two to four weeks after treatment. There appeared to be little difference between LASIK and PRK in people with low myopia (0 to -6 D) but a pooled mean difference of -0.56 D in people with high myopia (-6 D to -15 D). However, only two trials contributed to the high myopia group and this difference in effect between subgroups was not evident at six or 12 months.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-05 21:50:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The principal findings of this updated review are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Visual recovery is faster following laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) than photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).</LI>
<LI>There is weak evidence that visual acuity at six months and 12 months may be superior with LASIK.</LI>
<LI>There is little evidence to suggest any difference in accuracy between LASIK and PRK at 12 months post-treatment.</LI>
<LI>There is little evidence to suggest any difference in safety between LASIK and PRK at six months or more post-treatment.</LI>
<LI>Sub-analysis of data from studies from 2008 onwards that used modern techniques revealed no significant difference between the contemporary forms of these techniques for any of the efficacy or safety outcomes beyond the two to four-week time point.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the previous version of this review we found that visual recovery is faster following LASIK than PRK, which is confirmed again in this update. We previously found that there was no clear difference in the efficacy of the two procedures. The addition of data from seven new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barreto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barreto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durrie-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Durrie 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hatch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hatch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moshirfar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Moshirfar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schallhorn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schallhorn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallau-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wallau 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manche-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Manche 2011</LINK>) has not altered these findings. The most significant finding of the inaugural review was that LASIK was safer than PRK. The additional data has altered this finding and no strong evidence of a difference could be found.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-12-10 14:00:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>It is widely accepted that visual recovery following LASIK is more rapid than following PRK. This is again supported by the data presented in this updated review. Our subgroup analyses show that this benefit is present across all degrees of refractive errors and regardless of whether newer technologies such as femtosecond laser flap creation and wavefront-guided ablation are used or not. From the patients' perspective, the more rapid visual recovery and less postoperative pain following LASIK are the main advantages of LASIK over PRK. The pain scores in the studies we found support the generally accepted view that LASIK is associated with less postoperative pain but more intraoperative discomfort than PRK. This is important when counselling patients about their operation.</P>
<P>When individual studies are examined the only trials which individually found a difference between the treatments were <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hjortdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hjortdal 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schallhorn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schallhorn 2009</LINK>. As discussed in the results section, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK> is at significant risk of bias. It is a large trial and carries significant weight in the analyses, therefore performing a sensitivity analysis on the relevant outcomes to which it contributes was essential.</P>
<P>At first glance, LASIK appeared to have superior efficacy with the odds of achieving a visual acuity of 20/20 or better at six months and 12 months significantly more likely than with PRK. The superior visual outcome at 12 months could be accounted for by the more accurate refractive outcomes seen with LASIK at 12 months. However, looking at the data more clearly, these findings were limited to the subgroup of patients with refractive errors up to -6 D. More importantly the results were sensitive to the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>. When analyses were performed without this potentially biased study, no differences were found in any of these outcomes.</P>
<P>The duration covered by this study encompasses huge advances in the technology and techniques used. To evaluate whether there was any difference in the contemporary forms of treatment, using femtosecond laser flap creation and wavefront-guided treatments, we stratified outcomes into studies from 2008 onwards in which these were used and those pre 2008 which employed older technology. This analysis demonstrated that contemporary studies do not show any difference in efficacy or accuracy between PRK and LASIK whereas older studies show a possible difference in favour of LASIK. This suggests that modern PRK with mitomycin C (MMC) and wavefront-guided treatments is equally as effective and accurate as LASIK.</P>
<P>We previously found that LASIK was potentially safer than PRK, based upon the fact that fewer LASIK eyes lost 2 or more lines of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and this finding was not sensitive to the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>. In this updated review, whilst there is still a significant difference in the loss of 2 or more lines of vision, which is less common in LASIK (odds ratio (OR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.98) this disappears once <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK> is excluded (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.26). Hence the updated data in this review does not support this finding. This difference is likely explained in the overall analysis by the inclusion of data from additional studies that has reduced the significant weight that Wang et al carried previously. When we performed a sub-analysis according to the surgical technology used it showed that prior to 2008 LASIK was less likely to result in loss of 2 or more lines of BCVA whereas in contemporary studies there was no difference between treatments. The implication for patients is that they can be reasonably confident that the risks involved are equal for both treatments.</P>
<P>In several outcome analyses <LINK REF="STD-Hjortdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hjortdal 2005</LINK> appears to have a different outcome from other studies and in some instances this resulted in the detection of statistical heterogeneity. This may in part be explained by the mean postoperative spherical equivalent outcomes for this trial. The forest plots of mean postoperative spherical equivalent refraction data are of limited value on their own but must be interpreted in conjunction with the raw spherical equivalent data. These data demonstrate that for prescriptions up to -6 D at two to four weeks post-treatment, the mean difference in refractive error between the two treatments was only 0.10 D (95% CI 0.04 to 0.16). There was no significant difference between treatments at six or 12 months. The data on refractive stability indicate that at one year post-treatment, neither procedure has a significant degree of change in refraction (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The follow-up duration reported in these studies was variable. Only eight of the 12 studies reported 12-month follow-up data and of those studies using contemporary techniques and published post 2008, only two of six reported 12-month follow-up data. The remainder reported six-month data. It is possible that this duration of follow-up is inadequate to determine the final visual outcomes for either or both of these procedures. There is evidence that vision may continue to improve after one year with continued resolution of haze (<LINK REF="REF-Rajan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajan 2004</LINK>). Recovery of corneal innervation and restoration of a normal tear film and ocular surface may also take longer than 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Calvillo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvillo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of visually significant corneal haze following PRK was found to range from 0% to 13% with an overall average of 3.3%. Only one instance of visually significant haze due to diffuse lamellar keratitis following LASIK was reported. The risk of significant haze after PRK is an important difference between these procedures, which in three of the recent trials was addressed using MMC as an adjunct (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Of the six contemporary studies three reported data on optical side effects such as glare and halos. None of these found any difference between PRK and LASIK.</P>
<P>The rate of flap-related complications in LASIK participants ranged from 0.7% to 15% and only one participant lost 2 or more lines of BCVA. This is in keeping with the published rate of approximately 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moshirfar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Moshirfar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stulting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stulting 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugar 2002</LINK>). Of the six post 2008 trials which used femtosecond lasers for flap creation only two reported flap complications. It is not possible to comment on the relative safety of mechanical versus femtosecond laser flap creation based on the current data set.</P>
<P>We incorporated an additional outcome measure of higher order aberrations into this study. All eight studies added to this update reported such data. The outcomes were remarkably similar. All but one study showed that in both PRK and LASIK there was a significant increase in higher order aberrations following treatment versus pre-operatively. There was no difference between the two treatments in the amount or type of aberrations induced by treatment.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-11-22 13:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Overall we graded the quality of the evidence as low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This was largely because of the potential for risk of bias in the included studies.</P>
<P>The major difficulty in combining the results of randomised controlled trials included in this review was the heterogeneity of outcome measures and follow-up intervals reported. Improved compliance with suggested methods for reporting visual and refractive results of trials involving refractive procedures has made this update significantly easier than the initial review. Our framework of clearly defined outcome measures at fixed time points has worked well in both versions of this review. The downside of using such rigid outcome measures is that it is difficult to extract complete data sets from each trial. Hence not all trials could be included in each of the outcome analyses. In this updated version we have modified the outcome measures to try to detect more subtle differences in visual outcome (BCVA less than or equal to 20/15) and safety (loss of 1 or more lines of BCVA). This approach was limited by the fact that a minority of studies reported such data.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials that we have included is in some cases satisfactory but not without flaws. The quality is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. Masking of participants and personnel when performing the procedure was not possible because of the nature of the procedures so studies were not excluded on the basis of this. Masking of outcome assessment was not performed in all studies and is a potential source of significant bias. We had concerns about the quality of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schallhorn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schallhorn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>) and we examined the effect of including these data using a sensitivity analysis. The mixture of study designs (unilateral versus bilateral treatment) posed a problem with data synthesis. In order to include data from all study types we assumed that the response of any eye to one treatment is in no way related to or predictable from the response of the fellow eye and we therefore treated data as unpaired for all studies. By doing this we may have lost the power to detect changes that a paired analysis may have found. However, if we were to analyse the paired and unpaired data separately we would have had only three trials with paired data and two trials with unpaired data. As not all trials reported data for each outcome and time point the outcomes that could be analysed in a meaningful way would be minimal. Accepting these limitations we were able to combine the data from these different trials and perform statistical analysis on the results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Revisions to outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Following advice from the Editorial Team of the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group, the outcome measures set out in the protocol for this review have been modified post hoc. This was necessary as a result of the diversity of outcome measures reported by the included studies. We defined new primary and secondary outcome measures as listed below. We chose three primary outcome measures that we believe best reflect the effectiveness and safety of these procedures. In this update version of the review we have also included data on higher order aberrations because these have become increasingly used to evaluate outcomes in refractive surgery.</P>
<P>The proportion of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/20 or better at 12 months post-treatment and the proportion of eyes within ±0.50 D of target refraction at 12 months post-treatment were chosen as primary outcome measures of effectiveness. Achievement of these outcomes at 12 months post-treatment would undoubtedly be considered a success by both surgeon and patient. They reflect the effectiveness in terms of achieving a satisfactory visual result (UCVA of 20/20 or better) and in terms of the accuracy of the procedure (±0.50 D of target refraction). We chose the 12-month over the six-month time point because of our concerns that refractive stability may not yet have been achieved and corneal haze not yet resolved in some participants at six months.</P>
<P>Our primary outcome measure of safety was the proportion of eyes that lost 2 or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at six months or more post-treatment. We chose this outcome because it is a commonly employed measure of adverse outcomes in ophthalmology. The presence of haze sufficient to cause loss of 2 or more lines of BCVA at six months post-treatment was considered to be a significant adverse outcome and will be detected by this outcome. We chose the time point of six months or more because this allows sufficient time for resolution of mild to moderate corneal haze following PRK. It also allows for the detection of any adverse events that may occur after the six-month time point such as ectasia. A new section concerning quality of vision outcomes has been added to this updated version of the review. Quality of vision will be assessed using outcome data for higher order aberrations and modular transfer function data</P>
<P>A further outcome measure, the assessment of higher order aberrations has been added. This was added as it gives an indication of the quality of vision which is distinct from visual acuity and refractive error. Given that the vast majority of patients undergoing either treatment end up with excellent unaided visual acuity it may take more sophisticated measures of the quality of vision to determine whether there is any difference in the outcomes of these treatments.</P>
<P>We added a new table (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>: Higher order aberrations and modulation transfer function data).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Revisions to analyses</HEADING>
<P>Two subgroup analyses were done that were not planned in the original protocol.</P>
<P>1. Comparing results in people with high and low myopia.<BR/>2. Comparing results from more recent studies with older studies as surgical techniques have changed.</P>

Explanations of questions were given by study personnel if requested by the patient. Participants were asked to assess subjective glare, halo and monocular diplopia in the operated eye on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 indicated an absence of symptoms and 5 indicated the worst symptom.<BR/>Single time point statistics were calculated using the number of participants in each group who gave an answer to the corresponding question in the survey. Comparison of pre and postoperative mean symptom grade within a treatment group was tested with Student's t test.

<P>Glare increased in the LASIK and PRK groups under both day and night conditions at 1 month before improving close to preoperative levels (Figure 11). There was no significant difference in subjective glare symptoms between the LASIK and PRK groups under both day and night conditions after month 1. Subjective symptoms of haze increased in both the LASIK and PRK groups. The 6-month increase in mean haze symptoms in the LASIK subgroup was skewed by a single eye that experienced severe subjective symptoms of haze (9 of 10). This eye had an UCVA of 20/16. Subjective symptoms of halos increased in the LASIK and PRK groups at 1 month before improving close to preoperative levels. There was no significant difference in subjective halo symptoms between the LASIK and PRK groups after month 1. Subjective symptoms of vision clarity in day and night conditions declined at 1 month from preoperative levels in both the LASIK and PRK groups but improved steadily at 12 months (Figure 14). The PRK group demonstrated a significant decline as compared to the LASIK group at 1 month under both the day (P = 0.001) and night (P = 0.001) conditions. There was no difference between the LASIK and PRK groups at 3, 6, and 12 months</P>
