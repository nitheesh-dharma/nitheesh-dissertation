<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-19 16:32:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. We studied two seizure types in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain; and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. Worldwide, phenytoin and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Objective</B>
</P>
<P>Phenytoin and valproate are commonly used treatments for individuals with epilepsy. The aim of this review was to compare how effective these drugs are at controlling seizures and whether individuals choose to withdraw from these treatments, to inform a choice between these drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>The last search for trials for this review was 19th May 2015. We assessed the evidence from 11 randomised controlled clinical trials comparing phenytoin to valproate and we were able to combine data for 699 people from 5 of the 11 trials; for the remaining 450 people from 6 trials, data were not available to use in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>This review of trials found no difference between these two drugs for the seizure types studied for the outcomes of withdrawal from treatment and controlling seizures. The review also found no evidence to support or refute the policy of using valproate for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures and phenytoin for partial onset seizures. However, up to 49% of people within the trials classified as having generalised seizures may have had their seizure type wrongly diagnosed, and this misclassification may have influenced the results of this review. We were unable to address the issue of preferring valproate for generalised onset seizure types other than tonic-clonic.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for the evidence of withdrawal from treatment and low to very low for seizure outcomes as it is likely that misclassification of seizure type influenced the results of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Phenytoin and valproate are commonly used treatments for individuals with epilepsy, but we found no difference between these treatments for the outcomes of this review or between seizure types. More information is needed as it is likely that misclassification of seizure type influenced the results of the review.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-04-24 15:55:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:45:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Worldwide, phenytoin and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs. It is generally believed that phenytoin is more effective for partial onset seizures, and that valproate is more effective for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. This is the latest updated version of the review first published in 2001 and updated in 2013.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-19 15:55:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the time to withdrawal, remission and first seizure of phenytoin compared to valproate when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures or generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (19 May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to 19 May 2015), SCOPUS (19 February 2013), <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> (19 May 2015), and <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP</A> (19 May 2015). We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-24 15:54:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of valproate monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-19 15:53:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Outcomes were time to: (a) withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time); (b) achieve 12-month remission (seizure-free period); (c) achieve six-month remission (seizure-free period); and (d) first seizure (post-randomisation). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-19 15:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IPD were available for 669 individuals out of 1119 eligible individuals from five out of 11 trials, 60% of the potential data. Results apply to partial onset seizures (simple, complex and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures), and generalised tonic-clonic seizures, but not other generalised seizure types (absence or myoclonus seizure types). For remission outcomes: HR &gt; 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes: HR &gt; 1 indicates an advantage for valproate.</P>
<P>The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to: (a) withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.09 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.55); (b) achieve 12-month remission 0.98 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.23); (c) achieve six-month remission 0.95 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.15); and (d) first seizure 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.14). The results suggest no overall difference between the drugs for these outcomes. We did not find any statistical interaction between treatment and seizure type (partial versus generalised).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 09:37:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between phenytoin and valproate for the outcomes examined in this review. However misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus seizure types. No outright evidence was found to support or refute current treatment policies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-19 16:18:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a disorder of many heterogenous seizure types, with an estimated incidence of 33 to 57 per 100,000 person-years worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Annegers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annegers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirtz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirtz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olafsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olafsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>), accounting for approximately 1% of the global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>). The lifetime risk of epilepsy onset is estimated to be 1300 to 4000 per 100,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul-Jenson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul Jenson 1983</LINK>), and the lifetime prevalence could be as large as 70 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ngugi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngugi 2010</LINK>). It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2004</LINK>) and around 70% of individuals can achieve seizure freedom using a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that both adults and children with epilepsy should be treated with monotherapy wherever possible (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The remaining 30% of individuals experience refractory or drug-resistant seizures, which often require treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or alternative treatments, such as epilepsy surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We studied two seizure types in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of<BR/>the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-19 16:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of people with epilepsy have their seizures controlled by a single drug (monotherapy) (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Worldwide, phenytoin and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy. Phenytoin is used as a first-line drug in low- and middle-income countries as it is a low cost drug and can be given as a single daily dose, but is no longer considered a first-line agent in the USA and much of Europe due to worries over adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilder 1995</LINK>). Phenytoin is associated with long-term cosmetic changes including gum hyperplasia, acne and coarsening of the facial features (<LINK REF="REF-Mattson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheinfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinfeld 2003</LINK>), as well as low folic acid levels, predisposing participants to megaloblastic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Carl-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carl 1992</LINK>), and is associated with congenital abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nulman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nulman 1997</LINK>), particularly foetal hydantoin syndrome (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=66008337579483720040120822181141&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Scheinfeld-2003">Scheinfeld 2003</A>). Furthermore, due to the pharmacokinetic profile of phenytoin, the plasma concentrations are difficult to predict and dosing will usually need to be informed by measuring plasma concentration. Valproate has also been shown to have teratogenic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Canger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomson 2011</LINK>), and is particularly associated with spina bifida and cardiac, craniofacial, skeletal and limb defects known as 'valproate syndrome' (<LINK REF="REF-Ornoy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ornoy 2009</LINK>). A systematic review found valproate to have the highest incidence of congenital malformations of standard antiepileptic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>), and a recent study has shown an increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders following prenatal valproate exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 2013</LINK>). Valproate is also associated with weight gain in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Dinesen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinesen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Easter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easter 1997</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novak-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novak 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:48:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is generally believed that valproate monotherapy is more effective than phenytoin monotherapy in generalised onset seizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, absence, and myoclonus), while phenytoin monotherapy is more effective than valproate monotherapy in partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures) (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1994</LINK>), although there is no conclusive evidence from individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support this belief. Evidence in favour of valproate for generalised seizures is predominantly anecdotal from observational studies, suggesting a dramatic benefit with valproate in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado_x002d_Escueta-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado-Escueta 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penry-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penry 1989</LINK>), and reports of efficacy of valproate against absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeavons-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeavons 1977</LINK>). The results of two RCTs, recruiting children indicate that valproate may be better tolerated in children than phenytoin (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilothammal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thilothammal 1996</LINK>); twice as many children experienced at least one side effect on phenytoin than valproate in <LINK REF="STD-Thilothammal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thilothammal 1996</LINK>, and phenytoin was more likely to be withdrawn due to unacceptable side effects than valproate in <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>Some animal models have suggested that phenytoin has either no effect in absence seizures or may in fact worsen seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>). There is also anecdotal evidence that phenytoin may cause paradoxical intoxication (increased seizure frequency with increased anticonvulsant dose) and encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Troupin-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troupin 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallarta-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallarta 1974</LINK>). </P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-19 15:53:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Accepting that phenytoin should not be a drug of first choice for individuals experiencing absence, myoclonic and atonic seizures, we still have insufficient evidence from RCTs to guide a choice between phenytoin and valproate for individuals with generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures or partial onset seizures. The aim of this review, therefore, is to summarise efficacy and tolerability data from existing trials comparing phenytoin and valproate when used as monotherapy treatments.</P>
<P>There are difficulties in undertaking a systematic review of epilepsy monotherapy trials, as the important efficacy outcomes require analysis of time-to-event data (for example, time to first seizure after randomisation). Although methods have been developed to synthesise time-to-event data using summary information (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>), the appropriate statistics are not commonly reported in published epilepsy trials.</P>
<P>Furthermore, although seizure data have been collected in most epilepsy monotherapy trials, there has been no uniformity in the definition and reporting of outcomes. For example, trials may report time to 12-month remission but not time to first seizure or vice versa, or some trials may define time to first seizure from the date of randomisation, while others use date of achieving maintenance dose. Trial investigators have also adopted differing approaches to the analysis, particularly with respect to the censoring of time-to-event data. For these reasons, we performed this review using individual participant data (IPD) which helps to overcome these problems. This review is one in a series of Cochrane IPD reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. These data have also been included in a network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), undertaken following a previous version of this review.</P>

<LI>For three trials, seizure data were provided in terms of the number of seizures recorded between clinic visits rather than specific dates of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>). To enable time-to-event outcomes to be calculated, we applied linear interpolation to approximate the dates on which seizures occurred. For example, if four seizures were recorded between two visits which occurred on 1st March and 1st May (an interval of 61 days), then date of first seizure would be approximately 13th March. This allowed an estimate of the time to achieve six-month and 12-month remission and the time to first seizure to be computed.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We calculated time to achieve six-month and 12-month remission from the date of randomisation to the date (or estimated date) the individual had first been free of seizures for six or 12 months, respectively. If the person had one or more seizure(s) in the titration period, a six-month or 12-month seizure-free period could also occur between the estimated date of the last seizure in the titration period and the estimated date of the first seizure in the maintenance period.</LI>
<LI>We calculated time to first seizure from the date of randomisation to the date that their first seizure was estimated to have occurred. If seizure data were missing for a particular visit, these outcomes were censored at the previous visit. These outcomes were also censored if the individual died or if follow-up ceased prior to the occurrence of the event of interest. These methods had been used in the remaining two trials for which outcome data were provided directly (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>).</LI>

Two review authors (SJN and AGM) independently extracted data from all case report forms, resolving disagreements by reconsidering the case report forms at conference. For the remaining trials, data on length of time spent in trial and reason for withdrawal of allocated treatment were provided directly. For the analysis of time-to-event, an 'event' was defined as either the withdrawal of the allocated treatment due to poor seizure control or adverse events or both. Non-compliance with the treatment regimen or the addition of another antiepileptic drug were also classed as 'events'. The outcome was censored if treatment was withdrawn because the individual achieved a period of remission or if the individual was still on allocated treatment at the end of follow-up.</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-04-24 15:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out our analysis on an intention-to-treat basis (that is, participants were analysed in the group to which they were randomised, irrespective of which treatment they actually received). Therefore for the time-to-event outcomes: 'Time to achieve six-month remission', 'Time to achieve 12-month remission' and 'Time to first seizure (post-randomisation)', participants were not censored if treatment was withdrawn.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we investigated the relationship between the time-to-event and treatment effect of the anti-epileptic drugs. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of log(HR) or treatment effect and associated standard errors in statistical software SAS version 9.2. (Copyright, SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.). The model assumes that the ratio of hazards (risks) between the two treatment groups is constant over time (i.e. hazards are proportional). This proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model was tested for each outcome of each study by testing the statistical significance of a time-varying covariate in the model. We evaluated overall estimates of HRs (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>Results are expressed as a HR and a 95% CI. By convention, a HR greater than 1 indicates that an event is more likely to occur earlier on phenytoin than on valproate. Hence, for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment or time to first seizure, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for valproate (e.g. HR = 1.2 would suggest a 20% increase in risk of withdrawal from phenytoin compared to valproate), and for time to achieve six-month and 12-month remission, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for phenytoin.</P>

<P>Due to the strong clinical belief that valproate is more effective in generalised onset seizures, while phenytoin is more effective in partial onset seizures, we have stratified all analyses by seizure type (partial onset versus generalised onset), according to the classification of main seizure type at baseline. We classified partial seizures (simple or complex) and partial secondarily generalised seizures as partial epilepsy. We classified primarily generalised seizures as generalised epilepsy. We conducted a Chi² test of interaction between treatment and epilepsy type.</P>

<P>Individual participant data (IPD) were not provided for six of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilothammal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thilothammal 1996</LINK>), in which a total of 450 individuals had been randomised to either phenytoin or valproate. None of these six trials reported the specific time-to-event outcomes chosen for this systematic review.</P>
<P>Two trials presented times at which the allocated drug was withdrawn and the reason for withdrawal in the trial publication for each individual (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>). Hence, these two trials could be incorporated into the analysis of 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'; one of the trials also presented information by seizure type (partial onset or generalised onset seizures) and therefore could also be included in the stratified analysis for 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' (<LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK> presents 'Time on trial drug' in months for each participant; therefore to calculate 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', we assumed that if 'Time spent on trial drug' was five months, the individual spent five full months (152 full days) on the trial drug before withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK> presents 'Withdrawal and time of occurrence by month' for each participant; therefore to calculate 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', we assumed that if withdrawal occurred during the fifth month, that withdrawal occurred halfway between the fifth and sixth month (i.e. participants spent 167 full days on treatment before withdrawal).</P>
<P>We could not extract sufficient aggregate data from the trial publication in any other trial, and we therefore could not include them in data synthesis. Full details of outcomes considered and a summary of results of each trial for which IPD were not available to us can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Individual participant data were provided by trial authors for the remaining five trials which recruited a total of 669 participants, representing 60% of individuals from all 1119 eligible participants identified in eligible trials (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>). Data were converted from paper format to computer datasets in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>), computerised data were provided directly in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>), and a combination of both (although mostly computerised) were supplied by the authors of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data were available for the following participant characteristics (percentage of participants with data available): gender (100%); seizure type (100%); age at randomisation (99%); number of seizures in the six months prior to randomisation (79%); and time since first seizure to randomisation (73%). Electroencephalographic (EEG) data had been recorded for all five trials, but only computerised in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>;). Similar difficulties were encountered with computerised tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) data, and neurological examination findings.</P>
<P>One trial recruited only individuals with generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures, some of whom were experiencing other generalised seizure types such as absence or myoclonus (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>). All generalised seizure types were recorded during follow-up for this trial. The remaining four trials recruited individuals with partial onset seizures (simple/complex partial or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic) and individuals with generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures. For the individuals with generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures recruited into these four trials, other generalised seizure types were not recorded during follow-up. As a result, the majority of the data from the five trials does not address the treatment of generalised seizure types, such as absence or myoclonus, but applies only to generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures. In our primary analysis, we use only the data for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures during follow-up as this is the most consistent approach; we also report a sensitivity analysis which includes data on all generalised seizure types from <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>.</P>

<P>Withdrawal data for 41 participants extracted from <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK> did not distinguish between seizure type (partial onset or generalised onset) and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis stratified by seizure type.</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (adjusted by seizure type for 528 participants) was 1.09 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.55, P = 0.64) indicating a slight advantage for valproate which is not statistically significant (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This result is similar to the unadjusted pooled HR (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and conclusions remain unchanged following the exclusion of 41 individuals in the stratified analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>). For individuals with generalised onset seizures (341), the pooled HR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.64, P = 0.94), indicating no clear advantage for either drug. For individuals with partial onset seizures (187), the pooled HR was 1.20 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.95, P = 0.47), suggesting an advantage for valproate which is not statistically significant. There was no evidence of an interaction between epilepsy type (partial onset versus generalised onset) and treatment effect (Chi² = 0.31, df = 1, P = 0.58, I² = 0%). (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>)</P>
<P>An important amount of heterogeneity was present between trials within the generalised onset seizure subgroup (Chi² = 8.44, df = 4, P = 0.08, I² = 53%). On visual inspection of the forest plot (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) one trial appears to be the source of this variability (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>), as this trial shows a large statistically significant treatment effect in favour of phenytoin, while the other four trials show a general non-significant trend in favour of valproate (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>, there is an indication that the proportional hazards assumption may be violated (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>); the P value of time-varying covariate is 0.054; however visual inspection of the survival plot shows no indication of survival curves crossing, which would imply non-proportional hazards (<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>). As a sensitivity analysis, a piecewise Cox regression model is fitted to investigate any change in treatment effect over time, assuming proportional hazards within each interval. The follow-up period of <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK> is split into three intervals based on the number of events and number of individuals at risk in each interval; time to withdrawal of allocated treatment occurring 0 to 50 days, 51 to 100 days, or after 100 days. Separate HRs can be estimated for each interval as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>For interval 0 to 50 days (13 events from 128 participants at risk) the HR was 2.79 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.54, P = 0.07), suggesting a large advantage for valproate which is not statistically significant.</LI>
<LI>For interval 51 to 100 days (6 events from 110 participants at risk) the HR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.23, P = 0.91), suggesting no clear advantage for either drug.</LI>
<LI>For interval after 100 days (4 events from 102 participants at risk) the HR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.77, P = 0.63), suggesting an advantage for phenytoin which is not statistically significant.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These results suggest some indication of a change in treatment effect over time, with phenytoin more likely to be withdrawn early and valproate more likely to be withdrawn later; however, the confidence intervals of the estimates are wide due to the small numbers of events within each interval so there is insufficient information to support the hypothesis of a change in treatment effect over time for <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>. However, this study has a shorter length of follow-up than the other studies included for this outcome (median time to withdrawal of allocated treatment for <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK> was 180.5 days and was 815 days, 952 days, 851 days and 912 days for <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>, respectively). The length of follow-up, may therefore, be too short to examine the hypothesis of a change in treatment effect over time.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(5) Misclassification of seizure type</HEADING>
<P>We did not find evidence of an interaction between treatment and seizure type in any analysis. This result is surprising, given the strong clinical impression that valproate is more effective in generalised onset seizures while phenytoin is more effective in partial onset seizures. The impression that valproate is better for generalised seizures may derive from its effects on generalised seizures other than tonic-clonic; however, we were unable to investigate these seizure types in this review. Misclassification of seizure type (whereby some individuals with generalised seizures have been mistakenly classed as having partial onset seizures, and vice versa) is a well recognised problem in epilepsy, and it may be that an interaction between treatment and seizure type has been masked because of this. Given clinical evidence that individuals with generalised onset seizures are unlikely to have an 'age at onset' greater than between 25 and 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>), we examined the distribution of age at onset for individuals with generalised seizures. This revealed that a substantial number of individuals classified as having generalised seizures had an age at onset over 30 years:</P>
<UL>
<LI>84 out of 86 individuals classified as having generalised onset seizures (98%) in <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>37 out of 71 individuals (52%) in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>30 out of 136 (22%) in <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>4 out of 14 (29%) in <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>; and</LI>
<LI>35 out of 77 (45%) in <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Therefore, a total of up to 190 out of 384 individuals (49%) classified as having generalised onset seizures may have had their seizure type misclassified (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> was a paediatric trial so no individuals over the age of 30 were recruited). Such a misclassification could bias our results against finding an interaction between treatment and seizure types (partial onset versus generalised onset) and could explain why we have not found strong evidence to support the clinical impression that such an interaction exists. We decided to investigate this further.</P>
<P>We undertook the following two analyses to investigate misclassification.</P>
<OL>
<LI>We reclassified all individuals with generalised seizures and age at onset greater than 30 into an 'uncertain seizure type' group.</LI>
<LI>We reclassified individuals with generalised seizures and age at onset greater than 30 as having partial onset seizures.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<BR/>The results for each outcome are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', reclassifying individuals does not provide stronger evidence of an interaction. However, results for the 'uncertain seizure type' subgroup (pooled HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.85), indicating a large but non-significant advantage for phenytoin, are substantially different in the direction of effect from estimates for the 'partial onset seizures' subgroup (pooled HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.95), and generalised onset seizure groups (pooled HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.38), both indicating a non-significant advantage for valproate.</LI>
<LI>Similarly, for 'Time to achieve 12-month remission', reclassifying individuals does not provide stronger evidence of an interaction, and again results for the 'uncertain seizure type' subgroup (pooled HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.17), indicating a non-significant advantage for phenytoin, are substantially different in the direction of effect from estimates for the 'partial onset seizures' subgroup (pooled HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.29), and generalised onset seizure groups (pooled HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.39), both indicating a non-significant advantage for valproate.</LI>
<LI>The results for 'Time to achieve six-month remission' are very similar regardless of whether individuals have been reclassified or not.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>For 'Time to first seizure', reclassifying individuals results in a more obvious interaction between treatment and seizure type.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>For generalised seizures, and age of onset more than 30 reclassified as 'uncertain seizure type', the result of the test of interaction between treatment and seizure type is Chi² = 4.87, df = 2, P = 0.09 (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>For generalised seizures, and age of onset more than 30 reclassified as 'partial onset seizures', the result of the test of interaction between treatment and seizure type is Chi² = 4.55, df = 1, P = 0.03 (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>The direction of effect for the 'uncertain seizure type' subgroup (pooled HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.17) is similar to that of the 'partial onset' subgroup (pooled HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11), both indicating a non-significant advantage for phenytoin. Valproate now appears even more effective in generalised onset seizures (pooled HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.97) when compared to the original analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reclassifying seizure type on the basis of age of onset provides evidence for an interaction between treatment and seizure type for the outcome 'Time to first seizure' only. A review comparing carbamazepine and valproate monotherapy for epilepsy undertook a similar investigation of seizure type misclassification (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>). For the outcome 'Time to achieve 12-month remission', reclassifying seizure type on the basis of age of onset provided evidence of an interaction between seizure type and treatment for that outcome. In that review, however, a significant interaction between age at onset and treatment was also found for 'Time to first seizure'. There were therefore, two potential explanations for the interaction found when individuals were reclassified according to age of onset. Firstly, misclassification had masked the interaction between treatment and seizure type in the primary analyses, and reclassifying individuals according to age of onset has reduced the bias caused by misclassification. Alternatively, age at onset was acting as an independent predictor of outcome, and the misclassification analysis using age of onset forced the results to reflect this.</P>
<P>To investigate the hypothesis of age at onset acting as an independent predictor of outcome in this review, we performed the following analysis for the outcome 'Time to first seizure'.</P>
<OL>
<LI>A Cox Proportional Hazards regression model (stratified by trial) fitted with a single covariate as a treatment indicator (phenytoin = 1, valproate = 0) was fitted.</LI>
<LI>A Cox Proportional Hazards regression model (stratified by trial) fitted with two covariates, treatment and age (measured as a continuous variable) was fitted.</LI>
<LI>A Cox Proportional Hazards regression model (stratified by trial) fitted with three covariates, treatment, age, and an age*treatment interaction term, was fitted.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We compared the difference in -2(log likelihood) of models 1, 2, and 3; we compared differences to a Chi² distribution with one or two degrees of freedom. The -2(log likelihood) values of the three models were 3192.81, 3192.41 and 3189.058, respectively. We therefore found no evidence that age is an independent predictor of outcome (P = 0.528 comparing goodness of fit of models 1 and 2). However, there is some indication of an interaction between age at onset and treatment (P = 0.067 comparing goodness of fit of models 2 and 3) as in the carbamazepine versus valproate review (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In model 3, the effect sizes for the three covariates are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Treatment HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.77, P = 0.213), indicating an advantage for valproate which is not statistically significant.</LI>
<LI>Age HR 1.002 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.01, P = 0.647), indicating no significant effect of age on outcome.</LI>
<LI>Age*treatment interaction HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.01, P = 0.067), indicating an interaction between treatment and age which is borderline statistically significant. This effect indicates that with increasing age of onset, treatment effect (advantage for valproate) seems to decrease by approximately 0.7% with each increasing year of age of onset. In other words, as in <LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>, there is an indication that younger individuals may fare better on valproate than older individuals, who fare better on phenytoin for this outcome.</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-19 15:54:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review do not demonstrate a statistically significant effect in favour of either valproate or phenytoin for the primary global outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time)'. This outcome is influenced by both the relative efficacy of the two drugs, and differences in tolerability and safety. As a difference in efficacy in one direction may be confounded by a difference in tolerability in the other, it may not be surprising that any estimated differences are small. The confidence intervals for this outcome are too wide to confirm equivalence and clinically important differences have not been excluded, particularly when results for generalised and partial onset seizure subgroups are examined. Furthermore, as at least three of the trials contributing individual participant data (IPD) to this outcome were open-label, clinical preconceptions about the two treatments, such as that valproate is more effective in generalised seizures, while phenytoin is more effective in partial onset seizures, and lack of masking, may have influenced the withdrawal rates of the two treatments.</P>
<P>Similarly for the secondary outcomes 'Time to achieve 12-month remission (seizure-free period)', 'Time to achieve six-month remission (seizure-free period)', and 'Time to first seizure', although no statistically significant differences were found between phenytoin and valproate, the confidence intervals are too wide to confirm equivalence.</P>

However, 376 individuals (33%) from four relevant trials could not be included in any analysis, as IPD were not available and outcomes of interest were not reported in the published reports (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilothammal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thilothammal 1996</LINK>). Sufficient data for 74 individuals (7%) were published in two trials to contribute to analysis for the primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>), but insufficient data were available to include these individuals in the analyses of other outcomes. Having to exclude data for a third of eligible participants due to lack of IPD and insufficient reporting in study publications is likely to impact on the applicability of the evidence, however it is difficult to quantify exactly how large this impact could be.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-19 16:57:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The five trials for which IPD were made available were of generally good quality, with all five trials describing adequate methods of randomisation, and <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> also describing adequate methods of allocation concealment. However, none of the five trials described a method of blinding of participants and personnel, and only one trial stated that cognitive outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation, raising the possibility of performance and detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>). Three trials were designed as open-label for "practical and ethical reasons" (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>); for example, <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK> stated that the side effects of the respective drugs would "quickly unblind" the trial anyway. A further difference between the five trials was the population recruited; two trials recruited adults of all ages (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>), one recruited children only (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>), one recruited adults and children (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>), and one recruited adults over the age of 60 only (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important limitation of the current evidence base is that, of the five trials providing full IPD, only one collected data on generalised seizure types other than generalised tonic-clonic seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>). Hence, the results for seizure outcomes ('Time to achieve remission' and 'Time to first seizure'), apply only to generalised tonic-clonic seizures, despite the fact that individuals may have been experiencing other generalised seizure types. This problem must be addressed in future trials.</P>
<P>For the reasons outlined in this section, the quality of the evidence was judged to be moderate for time to treatment withdrawal and low to very low for the outcomes of time to first seizure and time to remission (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:52:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Examining the subgroup analyses for trends shows inconsistent results. For the primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', estimates indicate a potentially important advantage for valproate for partial onset seizures, with no clear advantage for either drug for generalised tonic-clonic seizures, which goes against current practice and belief. For 'Time to achieve six-month remission', estimates favour valproate for generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with no clear trend for partial onset seizures. For 'Time to achieve 12-month remission', estimates favour valproate for partial onset seizures, with no clear trend for generalised tonic-clonic seizures, which again contradicts current practice and belief. For 'Time to first seizure', there is a trend in favour of phenytoin for partial onset seizures, with no clear trend for generalised tonic-clonic seizures.</P>
<P>Despite strong prior clinical impressions that valproate is more effective in generalised seizures and that phenytoin is more effective in partial onset seizures, we have failed to detect a significant interaction between treatment and seizure type for any outcome to support current practice. It must however, be understood that the confidence intervals around the estimates are wide, and that these results do not exclude the possibility of important differences existing.</P>
<P>Why have we failed to find an interaction between drug and seizure type? It may well be that an interaction does not exist. Alternatively, it may be that an interaction does exist but we have failed to detect it. We suggest the following reasons why this might have occurred.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Our meta-analysis may not have the statistical power needed to detect an interaction.</LI>
<LI>Generalised tonic-clonic seizures were the only generalised seizure type contributing to the main analyses. It may be that there is no difference between phenytoin and valproate for control of this seizure type, but important differences could exist for absence and myoclonus seizure types. However, were this the case, we might have expected to see a treatment-seizure type interaction for the outcome 'Time to treatment withdrawal of allocated treatment', if treatment were being withdrawn or a further drug added to combat other seizure types.</LI>
<LI>Due to the strong clinical impression that valproate is the treatment of choice for individuals with myoclonus and absence seizures, physicians may have been reluctant to randomise individuals with epilepsy syndromes particularly responsive to valproate into these trials (e.g. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). This seems unlikely given that recruitment into those trials of individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures took place some time before such beliefs became widely held in the UK.</LI>
<LI>The results of the original trials, and hence this meta-analysis, may have been confounded by classification bias, i.e. individuals with generalised seizures may have been misclassified as having partial onset seizures and vice versa. There is good evidence from a similar review comparing carbamazepine and valproate that misclassification is indeed an important issue in epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>). Within our review, the most striking indication that misclassification may be a problem is the classification of subjects in <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>. In this trial, 95 out of 166 (56%) of the recruited individuals were classified as having a generalised epilepsy, which seems unlikely given that the individuals were newly diagnosed and over the age of 60 (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>). It is also interesting to note that <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK> is the only trial in this review that attempted to recruit only individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, However, this trial recruited too few individuals to have the power to detect a difference between phenytoin and valproate. In this trial, for a subgroup of individuals with definite electroencephalographic (EEG) changes to support a diagnosis of an idiopathic generalised epilepsy, there appeared to be a greater (but not significant) advantage for valproate, compared to the trial population overall. This could again be interpreted as supporting the potential for misclassification, which in turn could confound an interaction between treatment and seizure type. We were unable to test for the effects of EEG changes on the interaction between treatment and seizure type due to EEG data not being collected for all trials, and even where it was available, it was not done in a uniform way. It is likely that these trials were initiated before the publication of the International League Against Epilepsy Classification of Epileptic Syndromes in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>), but they did use the International League Against Epilepsy Classification of Epileptic Seizures that was published in 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1981</LINK>), which does allow individuals to be classified as those with partial onset or generalised seizures. The age of onset distribution of individuals classified as having generalised seizures indicates misclassification is likely to have occurred in up to 190 out of 384 (49%) individuals classified as having generalised onset seizures. Our results, based on reclassifying the 190 individuals, indicate that classification bias is a potentially important confounder of the results of this review, particularly the outcome 'Time to first seizure'. Furthermore, there is evidence for this outcome of an association between age of seizure onset and treatment allocation, suggesting that younger individuals may fare better on valproate, while older individuals fare better on phenytoin. For these reasons, it is important that the issue of misclassification is addressed in future trials.</LI>
<LI>Finally, it should be mentioned that the preparation of valproate used in the included trials may have influenced the results. The trials conducted in the UK all used sodium valproate (Epilim) (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>, conducted in the USA, used valproic acid (Depakene) which is thought to cause more gastrointestinal side effects than preparations containing either a mixture of sodium valproate and valproic acid, or sodium valproate alone. There is no evidence from RCTs to support this, but there are some data from observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brasfield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brasfield 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cranor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilder-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilder 1983a</LINK>). Given that this meta-analysis, and a similar meta-analysis comparing valproate and carbamazepine have failed to find convincing evidence of differences in effect between different drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>), it seems unlikely that differing preparations of the same drug are likely to have a major effect.</LI>

<P>No single trial has found convincing differences between phenytoin and valproate with respect to seizure control or seizure type (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilothammal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thilothammal 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1985</LINK>). However, confidence intervals around estimates have been wide and equivalence cannot be inferred. Furthermore, this systematic review and meta-analysis has not found any statistically significant differences between phenytoin and valproate for any of the outcomes measures.

<P>The results of this systematic review do not provide any conclusive evidence for or against the current practice of using valproate as a first-line treatment for individuals with generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures, and phenytoin as monotherapy for individuals with partial onset seizures. Guidelines currently recommend lamotrigine as a first-line treatment for partial onset seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2007</LINK>); the results of this review do not inform current treatment policy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:53:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Finding overall differences between these standard antiepileptic drugs has proved elusive. If overall differences do exist across heterogeneous populations of individuals, such as those studied here, those differences are likely to be small, and in order to be clinically useful, future comparative antiepileptic drug trials will need to be powered accordingly. It has been argued that future comparative antiepileptic drug trials be powered to establish equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>), and therefore be capable of detecting what is considered to be the smallest important clinical difference. A network meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from phenytoin, valproate and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy, and it also found no differences between phenytoin and valproate for the outcomes specified in this review. This review and the network meta-analysis will be updated as more information becomes available.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need for future antiepileptic drug monotherapy trials that recruit individuals with specific epilepsy syndromes, to be designed and powered to detect a difference between particular antiepileptic drugs. An approach likely to reflect and inform clinical practice, as well as being statistically powerful, would be to recruit heterogeneous populations for whom epilepsy syndromes have been adequately defined, with testing for interaction between treatment and epilepsy syndrome. In view of potential problems of misclassification, syndromes will have to be well defined, with adequate checking mechanisms to ensure that classifications are accurate, and with a system to recognise uncertainty surrounding epilepsy syndromes in individuals within trials.</P>
<P>Clinical uncertainty about seizure and syndrome classification is often present at the time of diagnosis and initial treatment of epilepsy, and significant numbers of individuals with newly diagnosed epilepsy cannot be classified (<LINK REF="REF-Bodensteiner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodensteiner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ottman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottman 1993</LINK>). Seizures may have been few and unwitnessed, and investigations are commonly unhelpful, but there is nevertheless no doubt that seizures have occurred and should be treated. This most commonly applies to tonic-clonic seizures that may be generalised at onset, or which may be secondarily generalised. In any trial, such unclassified individuals need to be clearly identified, because if they are not they may confound interpretation of results for well classified individuals. We need to know how to manage those whose classification we find more difficult.</P>
