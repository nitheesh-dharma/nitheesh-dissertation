<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-04-20 15:06:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Leprosy remains a public health issue in poorer parts of the world. In 2007 there were approximately 255,000 new cases reported worldwide. Leprosy (or Hansen's disease) is a chronic infectious disease. The skin and peripheral nerves of people with leprosy contain leprosy bacteria. Leprosy can be cured with a combination of antibiotics. The immune system plays an important role in leprosy and determines if and how the disease will develop. The response of the immune system to the antigens of the leprosy bacteria may cause periods of inflammation in the skin and nerves, called reactions. Reactions are the main cause of acute nerve damage and disability in leprosy and occur in about one third of people with leprosy. One type of reaction is erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a serious and often chronic complication of leprosy caused by the immune system. People with ENL have red, painful swellings in the skin and often feel ill due to fever and general malaise. There are several treatments for ENL, including the oral drugs prednisolone, thalidomide, and clofazimine. We undertook a systematic review on this topic as it was not clear which treatments were most beneficial.</P>
<P>Our review included 13 randomised controlled trials involving 445 participants. These trials assessed: betamethasone (1 trial), thalidomide (5 trials), pentoxifylline (1 trial), clofazimine (3 trials), indomethacin (2 trials), and levamisole (1 trial). Generally, the quality of the studies was poor and many were too small to identify important clinical differences even if they existed. Three small trials showed benefit for thalidomide and clofazimine treatment in terms of fewer further reactions, more treatment successes, and less relapses of ENL.</P>
<P>Adverse events were reported in most of the trials, but it was often not possible to compare the occurrence of any adverse events between the experimental group and control group. Most adverse events reported were not too serious, and only a few participants could not complete treatment due to serious adverse events or for other reasons.</P>
<P>Whether the interventions improved the quality of life of participants, was not evaluated in any of the trials.</P>
<P>Although we did not find clear benefits in these series of small, poorly-performed studies, this does not mean that these drugs do not work in the treatment of ENL, only that scientific evidence is insufficient. Future studies should be better designed and use clear definitions and outcomes, including long-term outcomes and quality of life measures.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-28 15:59:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We included 13 studies with a total of 445 participants. The quality of the trials was generally poor and no results could be pooled due to the treatments being so heterogeneous. Treatment with thalidomide showed a significant remission of skin lesions compared to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) (RR 2.43; 95% CI 1.28 to 4.59) (1 trial, 92 participants). Clofazimine treatment was superior to prednisolone (more treatment successes; RR 3.67; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.91) (1 trial, 24 participants), and thalidomide (fewer recurrences; RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.56) (1 trial, 72 participants). We did not find any significant benefit for intravenous betamethasone compared to dextrose (1 trial, 10 participants), pentoxifylline compared to thalidomide (1 trial, 44 participants), indomethacin compared to prednisolone, aspirin or chloroquine treatments (2 trials, 80 participants), or levamisole compared to placebo (1 trial, 12 participants). Mild to moderate adverse events were significantly lower in participants taking 100 mg thalidomide compared to 300 mg thalidomide daily (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93). Significantly more minor adverse events were reported in participants taking clofazimine compared with prednisolone (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.35). None of the studies assessed quality of life<B> </B>or economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-20 14:52:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>There is some evidence of benefit for thalidomide and clofazimine, but generally we did not find clear evidence of benefit for interventions in the management of ENL. However, this does not mean they do not work, because the studies were small and poorly reported. Larger studies using clearly defined participants, outcome measures, and internationally recognised scales are urgently required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-04-29 11:51:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium <I>Mycobacterium (M.) leprae</I>. Leprosy bacteria are spread as droplets from the nose of infected and untreated individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Barton-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pedley-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedley 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Job-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Job 2008</LINK>), but the importance of other routes of transmission is unclear. When the immune system fails to respond effectively, the disease will develop. Often, the first sign of leprosy is a patch on the skin, but damage to peripheral nerves may occur as well (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2001</LINK>). Leprosy develops in various clinical forms, dependent upon the response of the immune system. The internationally accepted Ridley-Jopling classification for leprosy recognises five different groups across a spectrum: tuberculoid (TT), borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline (BB), borderline lepromatous (BL), and lepromatous (LL) (<LINK REF="REF-Ridley-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridley 1966</LINK>). Across this spectrum, people with tuberculoid leprosy have a strong immune response, only a few skin patches, and a low bacterial load, while people with lepromatous leprosy have no or very weak cell-mediated immunity for <I>M. leprae, </I>have many skin patches, and a high bacterial load. Most people have one of the borderline forms of leprosy: borderline tuberculoid (BT), mid-borderline (BB), or borderline lepromatous (BL). These forms are less easy to distinguish and less stable, meaning that one can shift from one form to another (<LINK REF="REF-Hastings-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hastings 1988</LINK>). An additional classification has been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is based on the number of skin lesions only. People with five or less skin lesions are classified as having paucibacillary (PB) leprosy, while people with six or more skin lesions are classified as having multibacillary (MB) leprosy. This classification is often used in practice to decide what type of multiple-drug therapy (MDT) should be given to a person with leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Leprosy infection can be treated effectively with a combination of antibiotics. Multiple-drug therapy (MDT) with the antibiotics rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine was introduced in the 1980s and is provided free by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Those with PB leprosy receive treatment (dapsone and rifampicin) for six months and those with MB leprosy are treated with dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine for 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Since the introduction of MDT, the number of people affected by leprosy has decreased substantially. At the beginning of 2008 the prevalence was about 213,000 worldwide. This is the registered number of people on MDT treatment. The number of people newly reported in 2007 was approximately 255,000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The body's immune response to the leprosy bacillus may also cause so-called 'reactions'. There are two types of potentially nerve damaging reactions: type 1 reaction or reversal reaction, and type 2 reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Type 1, or reversal reaction, presents as acute inflammation in skin lesions and nerves. Erythema nodosum leprosum presents as new, red, painful and tender swellings in the skin, usually on the legs and arms, and sometimes on the trunk; it varies in severity. When the reaction is mild, only the skin is affected and there may be low-grade fever. When the reaction is severe, the swellings are multiple and may ulcerate, there may be high fever and other organs may be inflamed, such as the nerves, eyes, joints, testes, and lymph nodes. If neuritis is present, it is often less severe than neuritis resulting from type 1 reaction (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahawita-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahawita 2008</LINK>). Most people with ENL have acute multiple episodes of ENL or chronic ENL over several years. Few people experience a single acute episode of ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Nery-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nery 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocaterra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocaterra 2006</LINK>). Single acute ENL reaction can be defined as one ENL episode with no recurrence of ENL whilst receiving prednisolone, no increase in severity requiring an increased steroid dose, and no recurrence after the prednisolone has stopped. Acute multiple ENL reaction is defined as more than one ENL episode with the same characteristics as acute single ENL. Chronic ENL is defined as an episode lasting for more than six months. This could include single and multiple episodes. Distinguishing and recognising these different types of ENL will be useful in individual management and treatment of ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Pocaterra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocaterra 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Erythema nodosum leprosum only occurs in people with borderline lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous (LL) leprosy. These people have high bacterial loads which increase the risk of ENL. The percentage of people diagnosed with ENL differs between countries and studies. Countries in Asia and Brazil report high rates of ENL. A study from India found an overall ENL prevalence of 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Pocaterra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocaterra 2006</LINK>) and a study from Brazil reported an ENL rate of 31% among people on MB MDT treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Nery-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nery 1998</LINK>). Studies that look at BL and LL subgroups rather than the whole MB leprosy group will give better estimations of ENL rates, because only these subgroups are at risk of developing ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>). An Indian study found that almost 50% of people with LL and 9% of people with BL had ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Pocaterra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocaterra 2006</LINK>), and in a study from Ethiopia 12% of those with LL and 4% of those with BL developed ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>). Erythema nodosum leprosum may occur before the start of treatment, but usually develops within the first three years after starting multiple-drug therapy (MDT). After completion of treatment, people may still have episodes of ENL for several years, because they have persisting mycobacterial antigens despite successful antibacterial treatment (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Erythema nodosum leprosum is an immune-mediated complication of leprosy. It is caused partly by deposition of <I>M. leprae </I>antigen and antibody complexes. These complexes circulate in the blood and may precipitate in tissue, particularly on the wall of small blood vessels, causing acute inflammation (vasculitis) and release of tissue-damaging enzymes in any organ or tissue invaded by the leprosy bacillus. In addition, the immune system activates cells (macrophages and T cells) that attack and kill the bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahawita-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahawita 2008</LINK>). Risk factors for developing ENL are lepromatous classification, high bacterial loads, and being aged under 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-Manandhar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manandhar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>People who have ENL usually feel ill (general malaise, fever) and many organs may be affected. Erythema nodosum leprosum is often a recurrent or chronic condition and requires treatment for a long period. Having repeated episodes of ill health, especially in people who are in an economically active period in their lives may cause a further burden. It may affect male fertility due to inflammation of the testis. Women are affected by having fewer treatment options in their childbearing years due to the side-effects of drugs such as thalidomide (<LINK REF="REF-Nery-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nery 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocaterra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocaterra 2006</LINK>). Leprosy has a far more negative image than many other diseases. Having visible signs of leprosy or side-effects from treatment triggers discrimination and stigmatisation (<LINK REF="REF-Heijnders-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijnders 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rafferty-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafferty 2005</LINK>). The psychological impact of a chronic and stigmatising condition may be profound.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-04-21 14:25:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Most therapies for ENL aim to control acute inflammation, relieving the pain and preventing further nerve damage or new episodes. Several treatments are available for ENL.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-04-29 09:34:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>The conventional treatment for mild ENL is rest and anti-inflammatory medication to control the acute inflammatory skin lesions and fever. Aspirin is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory drug, but indomethacin, chloroquine, and colchicine have been tested as well. These different anti-inflammatory drugs have not been formally compared in mild ENL and there is no data to suggest that they are superior to aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>For severe ENL, prednisolone and clofazimine are most commonly used. Prednisolone usually acts rapidly by controlling the acute inflammation and relieving the pain, fever, and other signs. The starting dose should be the lowest possible to control ENL and be gradually reduced. The schedule for reducing prednisolone depends on the course of the disease. Erythema nodosum leprosum is often recurrent or chronic and requires high-dose and prolonged courses of prednisolone for the disease to be controlled. This increases the risk of adverse events, such as hypertension or diabetes, and steroid dependency (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clofazimine is considered a useful anti-inflammatory drug when corticosteroids are contraindicated or need to be reduced (<LINK REF="REF-WHO" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO</LINK>). However, treatment with clofazimine usually takes four to six weeks to become active and the dose of clofazimine needed to control ENL is higher than the dose used in MDT (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 1996</LINK>). Disadvantages of continuous high doses of clofazimine are gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea) and dark discolouration of the skin. These skin changes usually develop within a few weeks after starting clofazimine treatment and may take two or more years to disappear (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another drug used to treat ENL is thalidomide. The effectiveness of thalidomide in ENL is primarily due to its action on the proflammatory cytokine TNF-&#945; (tumour necrosis factor-&#945;) but other mechanisms may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>). The seventh WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy considered thalidomide as an effective treatment of severe ENL, and recommended restriction of thalidomide treatment to male or postmenopausal female patients only. Thalidomide should only be given to women of childbearing age when comprehensive contraceptive precautions can be taken, because its use may cause serious birth defects when taken in early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other therapies have been tested, such as ciclosporin, pentoxifylline, oral zinc, and <I>Mycobacterium w</I> vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-Uyemura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uyemura 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaheer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaheer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahajan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahajan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nery 2000</LINK>). New therapies for other immune-mediated conditions seem promising. Examples are TNF-&#945; antibody treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin, and tenidap (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1996</LINK>). TNF-&#945; antibody treatment (infliximab) has been reported to be successful in the treatment of a single case of recurrent ENL (<LINK REF="REF-Faber-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faber 2006</LINK>). However, the person relapsed and eventually required treatment with thalidomide (Faber, personal communication). It is plausible that these therapies may be effective for controlling ENL, but evidence from randomised controlled trials is very limited.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-04-21 14:28:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Erythema nodosum leprosum is a serious immunological complication of leprosy. The complex mechanisms underlying ENL are not yet fully understood, which makes treatment difficult. Corticosteroids, clofazimine, and thalidomide are the drugs of choice for ENL, but all have drawbacks and the optimal regimen has not been established. Alternative therapies have been tested, but it is unclear if they are beneficial, or which one is preferable. The role of newer treatments, such as TNF-&#945; antibody treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin, and tenidap, is not known.</P>

<P>The Collaboration's recommended tool for assessing risk of bias was used (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), the methodological quality of the trials was generally poor. Since no meta-analyses were performed, sensitivity analysis based on methodological quality was not performed.</P>
<P>Three trials had a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helmy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Helmy 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 1971</LINK>). The main concerns associated with cross-over trials are: (i) whether the cross-over design is suitable; (ii) whether there is a carry-over effect; (iii) whether only first period data are available; (iv) incorrect analysis; and (v) comparability of results with those from parallel-group trials. None of the trials had a wash-out period between the two interventions, which might have caused a possible carry-over effect, especially in the trial assessing clofazimine that can persist in the body for a long time. We analysed these trials using data from the first phase only if these were available to overcome these concerns.</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated reactions of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sheskin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Sheskin 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>). Participants received up to four treatment regimens for each reaction during the trials. This may have led to an over-estimate of the effect because the within-patient variance between outcomes of the same person may be smaller than the between-patient variance of outcomes between individuals. We used only data of the first randomised treatment if these were available to overcome this concern.</P>

<P>Withdrawals from thalidomide treatment were caused by intestinal obstruction (1/12 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1969</LINK>), and worsening of ENL symptoms (3/22 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>). Minor adverse events not requiring withdrawal from thalidomide treatment (e.g. mild dermatitis, constipation, nausea, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, dizziness, dryness) were reported, but data for comparison was often unclear or lacking (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheskin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Sheskin 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sales-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sales 2007</LINK>). Significantly less participants in the 100 mg thalidomide regimen group reported any mild to moderate adverse events compared to those in the 300 mg thalidomide regimen group during the seven-week regimen (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93; n=22; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>). Withdrawals from pentoxifylline were due to gastrointestinal intolerance to the drug (1/24 participants) and fever and continuing lesion inflammation (3/24 participants). Adverse events not requiring withdrawal from pentoxifylline treatment (e.g. gastrointestinal complaints, nausea) were reported in 2/24 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sales-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sales 2007</LINK>). Significantly more participants who received clofazimine had minor adverse events compared to those who received prednisolone (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.35; n=24; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). In the clofazimine group all participants had red/black pigmentation. No withdrawals from either clofazimine or prednisolone treatment were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK>). Withdrawal from indomethacin treatment was due to deterioration of ENL (1/16 participants). Minor adverse events (e.g. nausea, dizziness, insomnia) were more frequently reported in participants who received indomethacin (9 events) compared to those who received prednisolone (1 event) (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1969</LINK>). No significant differences in minor adverse events (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, headache) were observed between indomethacin and chloroquine (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.10; n=23; <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>), prednisolone (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63; n=24; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>) and aspirin (RR 2.23; 95% CI 0.87 to 5.71; n=25; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>) respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1969</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-06 15:27:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There are no good controlled trial data on the optimum treatment for controlling the acute phase of ENL. Our review included 13 randomised controlled trials involving 445 participants, and assessed the effects of betamethasone, thalidomide, pentoxifylline, clofazimine, indomethacin, and levamisole in the management of ENL. One trial showed thalidomide treatment to be superior to acetylsalicylic acid treatment (less new reactions requiring further treatment) (<LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>) in the short-term control of ENL. Two trials showed significant longer-term benefits of clofazimine treatment compared to thalidomide (fewer recurrences) or prednisolone (more treatment successes) respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1976</LINK>). Mild to moderate adverse events were significantly higher in participants taking a 300 mg versus 100 mg dose of thalidomide (<LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>) and in participants taking clofazimine compared with prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results should be considered with caution, due to methodological shortcomings. Data extraction of the study of <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK> was limited to the results of the first randomised treatment regimen to avoid having more than one outcome per participant in the analysis. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1976</LINK> participants continued on a maintenance dose of either 100 mg clofazimine or 50 mg thalidomide daily during the year after therapy. The study found significantly less recurrences of ENL in the group who received clofazimine therapy and this effect may be due to the persistence of clofazimine in the body over a longer period of time. <LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK> tapered the dose of prednisolone (starting at 30 mg daily and tapered off to 5 mg daily), while the dose of clofazimine (300 mg daily) remained the same during the 12-week treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-04-29 14:40:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The studies identified were not sufficient to address all of the objectives of the review. Two studies had outcome measures that were considered to reflect our primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Sheskin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Sheskin 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK>). Three studies assessed the disappearance of existing ENL skin lesions rather than the absence of new ENL skin lesions at the end of the therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sales-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sales 2007</LINK>), and one study reported no further reactions after the first treatment regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>). None of the studies reported adequately on the secondary outcome measure: remission of inflammation at other sites upon completion of the ENL therapy, as assessed by a clinician. Seven studies assessed changes in ENL severity using a self-defined definition, scale, or score (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helmy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Helmy 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arora-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girdhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Girdhar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>). None of the studies reported on the secondary outcome or time to next clinical episode, but four studies recorded recurrences of ENL in participants whose initial reaction was controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Karat-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karat-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Karat 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villahermosa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Villahermosa 2005</LINK>). Adverse events were reported in all but three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Helmy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Helmy 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arora-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1985</LINK>). None of the studies assessed the effect of the intervention on quality of life of participants. The studies did not provide separate data for different subgroups, such as disease severity (mild or severe) or duration (single acute, multiple acute, or chronic), while this could have given useful information on effectiveness of treatment for different types of ENL. The results of the studies do not allow any robust conclusion regarding the general applicability of any of the interventions tested.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-04-20 16:11:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>The quality of trials was generally poor, especially in studies published more than 20 years ago, due to the lack of clear reporting of methods, data, and the allocation process. Most of the studies were too small (10 to 92 participants) to identify important differences even if they existed. Three studies had a cross-over design which is associated with increased risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helmy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Helmy 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 1971</LINK>). We therefore considered only the first phase treatment. Two studies used more than one outcome of individual participants in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sheskin-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Sheskin 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>). This may have led to an over-estimate of the effect because the within-patient variance between outcomes of the same person may be smaller than the between-patient variance of outcomes between individuals. We used only data of the first randomised treatment to overcome this concern and these were only available for the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Iyer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Iyer 1971</LINK>. Most of the trials reported comedication, which may have diluted the effect of the intervention tested in the studies. Most of the studies were not clear as to how allocation sequences were generated or how allocation was concealed. Blinding, especially of the outcome assessor, was not described at all or unclear. Trials assessing clofazimine were unblinded the moment skin discolouration appeared. This might have biased the outcome assessments. Six studies reported incomplete outcome data, but only two of those performed an intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline data were poorly reported and absent in five studies. Adverse effects were often reported inadequately, limiting comparisons between experimental and control groups.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-12-22 08:56:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The search process was elaborate and to our knowledge no other randomised controlled trials were available for this review. It is possible that not all relevant studies have been included in this review, and that we failed to find some unpublished trials. We contacted several people, but did not identify any new trials. The quality of reporting was generally poor and this may have led to misunderstandings during the critical appraisal of the studies. We contacted authors of studies less than 15 years old, but had poor response to requests for additional information. We were unable to assess for publication bias as there were not enough studies to perform a funnel plot. Most studies were small and showed no significant effect and we considered publication bias in this case not very likely. Some studies, assessing interventions for people with lepromatous leprosy and containing potentially useful data, had to be excluded because no separate results for people with ENL were reported.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-20 16:11:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>A few systematic reviews on interventions for ENL have been found, but these focused on thalidomide and included non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Penna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Penna 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>). These reviews concluded that although beneficial effects of thalidomide treatment were found, the evidence is limited due to methodological differences between studies and the use of thalidomide is restricted because of possible serious adverse effects such as teratogenicity, neuropathy, and thromboembolisms.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-06 15:27:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-04-29 14:45:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There is some evidence of benefit for thalidomide and clofazimine, but generally we found insufficient evidence to make any firm recommendations on the use of any of the interventions tested for management of ENL and included in this review. This does not mean they do not work, because the studies were generally of poor quality and small-sized.</P>
<P>Treatment with thalidomide showed a significant benefit compared to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Clofazimine treatment was superior to prednisolone and thalidomide. Current guidelines for the management of ENL are given by bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP), but these guidelines are not supported by evidence from randomised controlled trials and are developed from practice.</P>
<P>Most of the studies reported adverse effects of treatment. Mild to moderate adverse events were significantly higher in participants taking a 300 mg versus 100 mg dose of thalidomide and in participants taking clofazimine compared with prednisolone. In only a few instances was withdrawal from treatment required, but it was not always clear whether this was due to treatment or for another reason. Adverse effects of commonly used drugs, such as prednisolone, clofazimine, and thalidomide are well-documented and should be kept in mind when prescribing drugs for ENL.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-06 15:27:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The 13 trials included in this review were generally of poor methodological quality and have mostly been of short duration. A wide range of interventions were assessed, one trial evaluated betamethasone, five trials thalidomide, one trial pentoxifylline, three trials clofazimine, two trials indomethacin, and one trial levamisole.</P>
<P>It was often unclear what the duration and severity of ENL was before the starting of treatment. Future studies should have clearer case definitions for ENL and we recommend that different durations of ENL (single acute episode, multiple acute episode, or chronic) and different severity of ENL (mild or severe) be distinguished, as such subgroups may need different management of ENL.</P>
<P>Erythema nodosum leprosum is a complicated disease known for its unpredictablility, its variable severity and duration, and its often chronic and recurrent nature. Although most agents may work similarly for controlling the acute symptoms of ENL, prevention of recurrences is far more difficult.</P>
<P>There is a need for good quality studies which follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials, and for large multi-centre studies to ensure that enough participants are enrolled.</P>
<P>None of the studies investigated whether the interventions improved quality of life of participants and only a few examined the long-term effects of interventions. There is a need for clearly defined outcome measures, both in the short-term and longer-term. We would recommend that future studies include outcomes such as absence of new tender erythematous subcutaneous skin lesions at completion of the ENL therapy, disappearance of inflammation associated with ENL at sites other than the skin (such as iritis and arthritis) at completion of the ENL therapy, as well as time to next clinical episode of ENL after completion of treatment, and quality of life measures.</P>
<P>It is recommended that internationally recognised and validated severity scales be developed so that results from different countries can be compared.</P>
<P>A trial comparing directly prednisolone and thalidomide has never been done, and is urgently needed.</P>
<P>Future studies should aim to assess the efficacy, safety, and optimal regimens of prednisolone and thalidomide for severe ENL and clofazimine for mild ENL as well as other potentially beneficial therapies.</P>

<P>In the original published protocol outcomes recorded for four weeks or less from the start of treatment were considered to reflect short-term benefit, and data that were recorded for three months or longer from the start of treatment were considered long-term outcomes. After extracting data, we found that timing of outcome assessment varied between four days and one year from the start of treatment.</P>
<P>We decided that studies with outcomes of four weeks or less from the start of treatment were considered as short-term outcomes. We added medium-term outcomes defined as outcomes between four weeks and six months from the start of treatment and changed long-term outcome assessment to more than six months from the start of treatment.</P>
<P>In the original published protocol we planned for two authors to independently extract the data, but it was more efficient to have one author extract the data and enter it into Review Manager, and a second author to check the data.</P>
