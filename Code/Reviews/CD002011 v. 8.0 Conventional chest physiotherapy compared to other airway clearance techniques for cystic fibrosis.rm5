<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>A comparison of usual chest physiotherapy to other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Excess mucus is produced in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. This leads to recurrent infection and tissue damage. It is important to clear this mucus using drugs and various chest physiotherapy techniques. We aimed to compare the effects of different methods on lung function and patient preference. We looked for studies lasting over one week. We included fifteen studies in the review. These studies did not show any difference between chest physiotherapy and other therapies in terms of lung function. Studies of acute infections showed improved lung function irrespective of type of treatment. Longer-term studies showed smaller improvements or decline. In ten studies participants preferred techniques they administered on themselves. The review was limited by the lack of well-designed long-term trials. We did not find evidence that conventional chest physiotherapy techniques were any better than other treatments for lung function. We can not recommend any single treatment over another at this time.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:37:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited life-limiting disorder, characterised by pulmonary infections and thick airway secretions. Chest physiotherapy has been integral to clinical management in facilitating removal of airway secretions. Conventional chest physiotherapy techniques (CCPT) have depended upon assistance during treatments, while more contemporary airway clearance techniques are self-administered, facilitating independence and flexibility. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare CCPT with other airway clearance techniques in terms of their effects on respiratory function, individual preference, adherence, quality of life and other outcomes. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:37:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also searched CINAHL from 1982 to 2002 and AMED from 1985 to 2002.</P>
<P>Date of most recent search: 01 September 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials including those with a cross-over design where CCPT was compared with other airway clearance techniques. Studies of less than seven days duration were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-24 10:39:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors allocated quality scores to relevant studies and independently extracted data. If we were unable to extract data, we invited authors to submit their data. We excluded studies from meta-analysis when data were lost or study design precluded comparison. For some continuous outcomes, we used the generic inverse variance method for meta-analysis of data from cross-over trials and data from parallel-designed trials were incorporated for comparison. We also examined efficacy of specific techniques and effects of treatment duration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-24 11:09:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We identified 83 publications and 29 were included, representing 15 data sets (475 participants). There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude any differences, between CCPT and other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function measured by standard lung function tests. Studies undertaken during acute exacerbations demonstrated relatively large gains in respiratory function irrespective of airway clearance technique. Longer-term studies demonstrated smaller improvements or deterioration over time. Ten studies reported individual preferences for technique, with participants tending to favour self-administered techniques. Heterogeneity in the measurement of preference precluded these data from meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of CCPT over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. There was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. Limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately-powered, long-term trials. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:42:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-24 10:37:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited life-limiting disorder. Persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs are the major contributory factors to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function over the years (<LINK REF="REF-Cantin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1997</LINK>). Continuous production of thick secretions leads to airway obstruction and mucus plugging (<LINK REF="REF-Zach-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1990</LINK>). Removal of airway secretions is therefore an integral part of the management of CF. A variety of methods are used to help remove secretions from the lungs, some physical (for example chest physiotherapy) and some chemical (for example medications and inhalation therapies). Treatment methods which improve secretion clearance are considered essential in optimising respiratory status and reducing the progression of lung disease. Chest physiotherapy plays an important role in assisting the clearance of airway secretions and is usually commenced as soon as the diagnosis of CF is made. </P>
<P>Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) techniques frequently involve the assistance of another person such as a physiotherapist, parent or caregiver. The techniques may include postural drainage, percussion and vibration, huffing and coughing. </P>
<P>More recently several self-administered airway clearance techniques (ACTs) have been developed. These include the active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), forced expiration technique (FET), autogenic drainage (AD), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), flutter, high frequency chest compression (HFCC) and exercise. All these methods are defined below. These methods of treatment aim to give the individual more independence and flexibility in clearing their airway secretions. Despite the expansion in number of treatment modalities, there remains little evidence supporting their efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Schans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Schans 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>A previous Cochrane review compared any form of chest physiotherapy to no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Schans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Schans 2000</LINK>). This included six cross-over studies, five of which involved single treatment measurements and the remaining study was conducted over two days. Conclusions suggested that ACTs could have short-term effects in increasing mucus transport, demonstrated by improved mucous expectoration or radioactive clearance. The absence of long-term studies precluded any conclusions regarding the ongoing effects of ACTs.</P>
<P>Another recently published Cochrane review compared positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy with other forms of airway clearance in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006</LINK>). Twenty studies met the review inclusion criteria, 16 of which were cross-over in design and seven of which were single treatment studies. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether PEP was more or less effective than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that participants preferred PEP compared to other techniques. Both reviews pointed out the relatively low quality scores achieved by included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Schans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Schans 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review compares CCPT with other ACTs used for airway clearance in people with CF. Subsequent reviews will continue to examine whether specific physiotherapy treatment modalities offer any advantages over others.</P>

<P>CCPT was compared with other ACTs as described below.</P>
<P>In the existing literature and in practical terms, variation occurs in the application of specific techniques.

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:38:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Relevant trials were identified from the Cochrane Group's Cystic Fibrosis trials register using the terms: physiotherapy AND conventional.</P>
<P>This register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) (updated each new issue), quarterly searches of MEDLINE, a search of EMBASE to 1995 and the prospective hand searching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology</I> and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work was identified by searching the abstract books of the three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis conference; and the North American Cystic Fibrosis conference and of the British Thoracic Society meetings, the European Respiratory Society meetings and there American Thoracic Society meetings.</P>
<P>Additional searches of two electronic databases not covered by the Group's search strategy were also undertaken. These were CINAHL from 1982 to 2002 and AMED 1985 to 2002 using the following sets of MeSH search terms:</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-24 10:50:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors (EM, AP) independently selected trials to be included in the review. We scored the quality of included studies according to criteria described by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). This method allocates five points on the basis of randomisation, double blinding and the description of withdrawals and dropouts. Studies scoring the maximum five points were considered to be of good quality. Studies scoring either zero, one or two points were considered to be of poor quality. Two independent authors categorised the physiotherapeutic interventions independently and allocated a Jadad score of methodological quality. If there was disagreement about whether we should include a study in the review or regarding the Jadad quality score allocated, we asked an independent author from a third centre to review the paper(s) in question.</P>
<P>The two authors extracted data independently on the outcome measures listed above. If we were unable to extract data directly from the publication, we contacted authors and invited them to provide data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We made considerable efforts to contact authors to request data. When we made contact, we sent at least two requests for data. If we could not locate authors, or they did not send the data, we placed these studies into a 'Studies awaiting assessment' category for potential inclusion in future updates of this review. Where data were either lost or we could not extract them in the format required, or where study design precluded appropriate comparison, we excluded studies from the meta-analysis but included them in the review. We used the Cochrane Review Manager software to compile and analyse the data (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we recorded either the mean change from baseline for each group or mean post treatment / intervention values and the standard deviation or standard error for each group. We incorporated data from cross-over trials into meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance method, involving expression of data in terms of the paired mean differences between treatments and their standard error. We calculated these values either from paired individual patient data provided by authors, or by calculation of mean differences between interventions and their standard error from means, standard deviations and P values reported in the manuscript (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). We combined data from parallel-designed trials with those from cross-over trials in meta-analysis. We calculated the standard errors in parallel-designed trials from the mean differences between treatments and their confidence intervals. We have reported these data in the comparison tables.</P>
<P>Some authors involved with cross-over trials were able to provide original individual patient data. For the studies where these data were not available, we elected to use a correlation of zero as the most conservative estimate. In future updates of this review, further data and better understanding of average correlations for these outcomes may allow the use of less conservative correlations.</P>
<P>In the case of binary outcomes, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we collected data on the number of participants with each outcome event by allocated treated group irrespective of compliance and whether or not the individual was later thought to be ineligible, or otherwise excluded for treatment, or follow up.</P>
<P>We grouped studies on specific treatment techniques for the purposes of meta-analysis (for example, all studies of CCPT versus PEP were grouped). This facilitated comparisons between specific ACTs, as well as comparisons with CCPT. For ease of comparison, and to avoid splitting data to the extent that no comparison was feasible, we also grouped some techniques which had similarities, for example, techniques which involved intra- or extra-pulmonary mechanical percussion (mechanical percussion, HFCC and acoustic percussion). In cases where study design incorporated three or more treatment arms (e.g. CCPT versus PEP versus flutter), we entered data in both subgroups so that we could make comparisons between CCPT and each of the other ACTs. We examined the need to perform sensitivity analyses based on the methodological quality of the studies, including and excluding quasi-randomised studies, however, this was not necessary on data currently included in the review.</P>
<P>In order to investigate the need for further meta-analyses, we also examined the potential effects of time according to duration of study. We compared studies undertaken during hospital admissions for pulmonary exacerbations (one- to three-week duration) to longer-term studies during stable disease. We anticipated substantial improvements in respiratory function in hospitalised participants as a result of intensive therapies, unlike results from longer-term studies undertaken during stable disease. In such studies we anticipated a maintenance or slow decline in pulmonary function. It is possible that certain ACTs, which have optimal efficacy during acute exacerbations, may not be appropriate for maintenance therapy and vice versa.</P>

<P>Of the studies relevant to this review, 42 publications were excluded, representing 31 sets of original data. Twenty-four of these were either single treatment studies or of less than seven days duration and were thus excluded. The remaining seven publications were excluded for the reasons now outlined. One study compared CCPT to a 'no treatment' group, thus did not include a valid comparative intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Desmond-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Desmond 1983</LINK>). One study included a withdrawal design (10: 2: 6: months) and data could not be extracted or interpreted (<LINK REF="STD-Oberwaldner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Oberwaldner 1986</LINK>). One study had to be excluded because participants were not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Orlik-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Orlik 2001</LINK>). One study was excluded because data had been lost by authors and could not be extracted from the publication (<LINK REF="STD-Tonnesen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tonnesen 1984</LINK>). One study compared CCPT with and without postural drainage and thus did not include a valid comparative intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Button-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Button 2003</LINK>). One study included only six participants, including some without CF and relevant data could not be extracted (<LINK REF="STD-Hartsell-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hartsell 1978</LINK>).

<P>Two independent authors categorised the physiotherapeutic interventions independently and allocated a score of methodological quality. There was no disagreement between authors in any cases. No studies were double-blinded which immediately limited the maximal score to three points. Of the 15 data sets included in this systematic review, methodological quality scoring (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) resulted in three studies achieving three points of a maximal five (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reisman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Reisman 1988</LINK>) and eight studies achieving only two points (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cerny-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cerny 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costantini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Costantini 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaskin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gaskin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Asperen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Van Asperen 1987</LINK>).

<P>Although a methodological score of two out of five is very low, these studies remain the current best available evidence within the field and it was considered reasonable to include them. It is not feasible in many cases for physiotherapists to incorporate blinding into study design, since participants are perfectly aware of the treatment they are receiving. The Jadad system and similar validated scoring systems are therefore a disadvantage to studies of this nature, and low scores are inevitable, since two out of five points are allocated for blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>

No overall group differences between CCPT or PEP were demonstrated in terms of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, mean difference (MD) -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.45 to 1.62); FVC, MD 0.38 (95% CI -1.56 to 2.33); or FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>, MD -0.44 (95% CI -3.38 to 2.50). Two studies demonstrated significant but divergent differences between CCPT and PEP.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">CCPT versus HFCC / MP</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared CCPT with therapies involving extra-pulmonary mechanical percussion (145 participants). These therapies included HFCC (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>), mechanical percussion (<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1994</LINK>) and acoustic percussion (<LINK REF="STD-Kraig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kraig 1995</LINK>). Due to their similarities in applied mechanical percussion, they were grouped for meta-analysis. Two studies were conducted during two-week hospitalisations for exacerbation (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1994</LINK>), while the other was conducted over two months (<LINK REF="STD-Kraig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kraig 1995</LINK>). There were no overall group differences between CCPT or extra-pulmonary percussive therapies in terms of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, MD -1.76 (95% CI -4.67 to 1.16); FVC, MD -1.42 (95% CI -5.17 to 2.33); or FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>, MD 0.49 (95% CI -2.53 to 3.52). All three publications concluded that there were no significant differences between CCPT and extra-pulmonary percussive therapies.

There was also a tendency for the annual decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to be worse in the FET group which did not reach significance; differences in FVC were also non-significant. RevMan analysis of these data produced similar results in terms of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, MD 2.80 (95% CI -0.39 to 5.99); FVC, MD 1.80 (95% CI -0.83 to 4.43); and FEF25-75%, MD 6.00 (95% CI: 0.55 to 11.45) (<LINK REF="STD-Reisman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Reisman 1988</LINK>).</P>

The resulting publication reported that while both groups improved significantly during the hospital admission, differences between groups were non-significant. However, RevMan analysis of data provided by the author showed significantly more improvement in respiratory function in the CCPT group than the exercise group: FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, MD 7.05 (95% CI: 3.15 to 10.95); FVC, MD 7.83 (95% CI: 2.48 to 13.18); and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>, MD 4.74 (95% CI: 1.94 to 7.54) (<LINK REF="STD-Cerny-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cerny 1989</LINK>). These results should be interpreted with caution. There were important differences in baseline respiratory function values between groups in this study, with those in the CCPT having significantly lower FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> values. This would almost certainly have influenced the magnitude of improvement during a two-week admission for acute exacerbation.</P>

If, during future updates of this review, new data indicate an effect of treatment duration, it will be appropriate to reassess data in this respect and production of comparative tables may be helpful.</P>
<P>Predictably, all four studies undertaken during two-week acute exacerbations demonstrated relatively large gains in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (range: 8.2% to 18.4% predicted); FVC (range of change: 8.3% to 22.5% predicted); and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> (range: 4.04% to 11.20% predicted), irrespective of treatment technique (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cerny-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cerny 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1998</LINK>). These results reflect a combination of low baseline pulmonary function prior to admission and then marked improvement as a result of intense therapy including antibiotics, nutritional supplements, inhalation therapy and physiotherapy.</P>
<P>In contrast to studies undertaken during pulmonary exacerbations, studies conducted between one and six months demonstrated noticeably smaller improvements or deterioration over time for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (range -3.38% to 4.44% predicted); FVC (range: -4.44% to 10.20% predicted); and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> (-2.45% to 3.37% predicted). Studies conducted over one year or more also demonstrated similar smaller changes in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (range: -4.70% to 5.98% predicted); FVC (range: -2.54% to 6.57% predicted); and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> (range -10.20% to 6.95% predicted).</P>

Costantini reported that both infants and their parents "greatly" preferred PEP to CCPT (<LINK REF="STD-Costantini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Costantini 1998</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review set out to determine if there was any advantage of CCPT (a technique used for more than five decades to clear pulmonary secretions) over other ACTs (more recently developed to encourage independence in self-care). Outcomes included pulmonary function, individual preference, adherence to therapy, quality of life measures and number of hospitalisations per year. Studies of less than seven days duration, including single treatment studies, were excluded. CF is a chronic disorder in which single treatment or short-term studies are inadequate in describing efficacy, safety or long-term acceptability of any interventions for this cohort. </P>
<P>The review of data from 15 trials comparing these groups could not demonstrate that any of the newer techniques were better than CCPT in people with CF, but this may have reflected insufficient data for meta-analysis rather than equivalence between techniques. There was limited evidence that participants preferred other techniques rather than CCPT. Evidence on adherence was inadequate to make any conclusions on choice of technique. </P>
<P>A feature of the meta-analysis of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB> data was the substantial heterogeneity in results between studies. These results may reflect differences between centres in terms of treatments, training or measurement techniques. However, even within individual centres, studies undertaken less than a decade apart, comparing the same interventions, demonstrated results that were not in agreement (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>). Another factor that may have contributed to the heterogeneity of these results could be the small numbers per participant group seen across virtually all studies. No single study recruited more than 36 participants to each study group and the mean number was far lower than this, introducing the possibility that most studies included in this review were inadequately powered to find differences between treatments if they existed and estimates of effect would be imprecise. </P>
<P>The absence of difference between treatments as demonstrated by the primary outcome measures chosen for this review may indicate that there are indeed no differences between treatment techniques. However, it may also indicate that the outcome measures selected for this review and for the original studies, were too insensitive to detect differences between treatments. It is possible that future studies may need to identify more sensitive indices of lung function such as lung clearance index or pulmonary scanning. However, measures such as these have not yet been validated in terms of clinical importance or relevance. </P>
<P>There were generally no systematic differences between CCPT and other ACTs in terms of the secondary outcome measures. The single exception to this was 'individual preference'. Ten studies included a measure of individual preference that showed, without exception, that individuals preferred to use ACTs that were self-administered and thus facilitated independence. For example, five out of six studies comparing CCPT with PEP demonstrated a preference for PEP (the remaining study did not measure individual preference). In addition, both studies comparing CCPT with AD demonstrated a preference for AD. Reasons for preference included comfort, convenience, independence, ease of use, more control and flexibility over treatment times and less interruption to daily living. Three of four studies comparing CCPT with mechanical percussive devices indicated that participants were satisfied with the devices, but only one of these assessed individual satisfaction within the CCPT group and found that the majority preferred mechanical percussion. </P>
<P>It is difficult to assess the extent to which researchers viewpoints may have influenced individual reporting of preference or satisfaction, especially since current trends tend to favour independence and self-therapy in terms of ACTs. No studies used standardised or comparable measures of individual preference but some studies measured this in a rather informal fashion. In the absence of any other clear objective distinctions between treatments, softer parameters such as individual preference seem to escalate in importance. This is particularly pertinent in a lifelong disease such as CF, where it is assumed that compliance with ACTs will be associated with a smaller annual decline in respiratory function. It is also assumed that the more satisfied individuals are with a treatment regimen, the more likely they will be to adhere to treatment.</P>
<P>An important issue that arose from examination of raw data submitted by authors was that, although group differences may not have indicated significant changes between treatments, it was clear that some participants responded extremely positively or negatively to individual treatments. In terms of individual patient management, 'statistical' recommendations may not always be appropriate and some experimentation may be required to provide the perfect solution for a particular individual's needs. As further studies are conducted, it may become apparent that some techniques may better suit certain ages and stages of the disease. Other factors such as pulmonary hyperreactivity may, for example, preclude certain techniques. There was no evidence from meta-analysis of available studies that any technique offered an advantage during acute pulmonary exacerbation compared to stable disease.</P>
<P>There was a great sense of frustration when original data could not be found by authors and could not be retrieved from the published manuscript. At times, a degree of re-analysis of original data was required, and this presented the possibility that the outcome described in the original paper would not quite be duplicated following re-analysis for the purpose of meta-analysis (this did not occur in the data submitted to date).<BR/> <BR/>In general, the systematic review of physiotherapy studies for CF present substantial challenges because of the great number of interventions, outcome measures and study durations. There has been a great deal of professional debate with regard to terminology reflecting the specific interventions. It is thus likely to cause some discomfort that we have chosen to lump, for the purpose of meta-analysis, certain interventions that appear to have similarities, for example those involving mechanical percussive devices. In future updates of this review and in the presence of large numbers of studies related to each intervention, there would be no need for such combinations.</P>
<P>Systematic reviews of physiotherapy studies also face the challenge of problematic quality selection systems used for scoring individual studies. Validated scoring systems such as those proposed by Jadad place great value upon randomisation and double blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). While randomisation and complete follow up remain important criteria in physiotherapy studies, many physiotherapy studies cannot easily incorporate blinding and are inevitably disadvantaged when measured using such scores. These studies become vulnerable to exclusion from review and the potential to recognise valuable clinical information may be missed. In this review, no studies were excluded on the basis of low quality scores. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There appeared to be no advantage of CCPT over other ACTs in terms of effect on respiratory function. It is important to note that this result may simply reflect the paucity of evidence rather than a definitive conclusion that CCPT is no better than any of the alternatives. The studies included generally scored poorly on quality assessment and it is likely that no single study was adequately powered to identify clinical differences. More long-term, well-designed studies with adequate participant numbers are needed to resolve this issue. There appeared to be a tendency for individuals to prefer self-administered ACTs. These seemed to offer more choice, independence and convenience in performing this daily routine. Clinicians may consider this when providing advice on which ACT is most appropriate for individuals old enough to be capable of self-treatment.</P>
<P>It was clear from examination of original data that individual responses to therapies were extremely variable. Some individuals improved significantly while others deteriorated. In light of the fact that this review cannot yet recommend any single treatment above others, physiotherapists and people with CF might feel more comfortable about trying various ACTs until a method is found that suits the individual best. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More than half the publications relevant to this review were excluded on the basis of study design; almost without exception because they involved single treatments or study duration of less than seven days. These study designs were purported to provide some information on treatment safety and efficacy. The chronic nature of CF necessitates daily treatment during the individual's lifetime. It is thus unlikely that safety or efficacy can be demonstrated over very short study intervals. Only four studies out of the 15 identified for possible inclusion were undertaken over a period of one year or more. More adequately-powered long-term randomised controlled trials (parallel or cross-over in design) need to be included in this review before clinically valuable information can be gained with regard to treatment efficacy and safety. </P>
<P>Trials of sufficient numbers and sufficient duration are recommended to determine if there is a difference in important outcome measures such as rate of decline in respiratory function, quality of life and independence. Other outstanding areas of research include identifying sensitive selection criteria (including age and severity of disease) for different treatment modalities. In addition, well-established standard measures of respiratory function, for example FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, are proving to be insensitive in early disease. Development of more sensitive outcomes, for example inert gas washout techniques may improve the ability to differentiate between treatments, especially during childhood.</P>
<P>The wide between-subject variability in response to physiotherapy treatments, continues to challenge healthcare professionals, but suggests that treatment selection may depend on factors that have not yet been identified. Future studies need to focus on the relationship between specific clinical or physiological features that may predict positive responses to specific treatment modalities. It may also be useful for studies to systematically monitor and record possible treatment-related adverse effects.</P>
