<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-03 10:13:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2011.</P>
<P>Tubal sterilisation prevents pregnancy by stopping the woman's unfertilised eggs from passing through the fallopian tubes to be fertilised by sperm. Techniques to close the tubes include cutting and tying them (partial salpingectomy), blocking them mechanically by using clips or rings, or by applying electric current (electrocoagulation) to damage and block them, and blocking them by using chemicals or tubal inserts (inserted via the mouth of the womb) that cause tubal scarring.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We, the Cochrane researchers, wanted to compare the different techniques for tubal sterilisation in terms of:</P>
<P>- how unwell they made women feel in the short and long term, including pain experienced (major and minor morbidity);</P>
<P>- failure rates (pregnancies);</P>
<P>- technical failures and difficulties encountered during the sterilisation procedure; and</P>
<P>- women's and surgeons' satisfaction.</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature up to 23 July 2015 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any methods of closing the fallopian tubes; RCTs produce the most reliable results.</P>
<P>
<B>Findings</B>
</P>
<P>We included 19 RCTs involving 13,209 women of childbearing age. The trials compared: </P>
<P>- tubal rings versus clips (six RCTs, 4232 women); </P>
<P>- partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation (three RCTs, 2019 women); </P>
<P>- tubal rings versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 599 women); </P>
<P>- partial salpingectomy versus clips (four RCTs, 3827 women); </P>
<P>- clips versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 206 women); and </P>
<P>- two types of clips, i.e. Hulka clips versus Filshie clips (two RCTs, 2326 women). </P>
<P>We found no RCTs that investigated sterilisation by chemicals or tubal inserts, so all the included studies involved an abdominal operation.</P>
<P>There were no deaths reported with any method, and major and minor morbidity were rare. Pregnancy rates were less than 5/1000 procedures one year after surgery. Complicationrates (problems after surgery/minor morbidity) were very low for all methods compared. Minor complications, including pain, and technical failures were more common with rings than clips. Major morbidity and postoperative pain were more common with partial salpingectomy than with electrocoagulation. Postoperative pain was reported twice as often by women sterilised by tubal rings than those sterilised by electrocoagulation.Technical failures were more common with clips than cutting and tying techniques, but operating time was shorter for clips.</P>
<P>We found little evidence concerning women's or surgeon's satisfaction. </P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Tubal sterilisation by cutting and tying the tubes, or using electric current, clips or rings, is an effective method of contraception with few problems. The choice of method will depend upon the surgeon's experience, availability of equipment, setting, and cost. More research is needed about methods for tubal sterilisation that do not require an abdominal operation.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:13:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 19 RCTs involving 13,209 women. Most studies concerned interval sterilisation; three RCTs involving 1632 women, concerned postpartum sterilisation. Comparisons included tubal rings versus clips (six RCTs, 4232 women); partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation (three RCTs, 2019 women); tubal rings versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 599 women); partial salpingectomy versus clips (four RCTs, 3627 women); clips versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 206 women); and Hulka versus Filshie clips (two RCTs, 2326 women). RCTs of clips versus electrocoagulation contributed no data to the review.</P>
<P>One year after sterilisation, failure rates were low (&lt; 5/1000) for all methods.There were no deaths reported with any method, and major morbidity related to the occlusion technique was rare.</P>
<P>Minor morbidity was higher with the tubal ring than the clip (Peto OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.78; participants = 842; studies = 2; I² = 0%; <I>high-quality evidence</I>), as were technical failures (Peto OR 3.93, 95% CI 2.43 to 6.35; participants = 3476; studies = 3; I² = 0%; <I>high-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Major morbidity was significantly higher with the modified Pomeroy technique than electrocoagulation (Peto OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.13 to 7.25; participants = 1905; studies = 2; I² = 0%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), as was postoperative pain (Peto OR 3.85, 95% CI 2.91 to 5.10; participants = 1905; studies = 2; I² = 0%; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>When tubal rings were compared with electrocoagulation, postoperative pain was reported significantly more frequently for tubal rings (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.17 to 9.84; participants = 596; studies = 2; I² = 87%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>When partial salpingectomy was compared with clips, there were no major morbidity events in either group (participants = 2198, studies = 1). The frequency of minor morbidity was low and not significantly different between groups (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI 0.46 to 119.01; participants = 193; studies = 1, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Although technical failure occurred more frequently with clips (Peto OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40; participants = 2198; studies = 1; <I>moderate-quality evidence);</I> operative time was shorter with clips than partial salpingectomy (MD 4.26 minutes, 95% CI 3.65 to 4.86; participants = 2223; studies = 2; I² = 0%; <I>high-quality evidence</I>).<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:13:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tubal sterilisation by partial salpingectomy, electrocoagulation, or using clips or rings, is a safe and effective method of contraception. Failure rates at 12 months post-sterilisation and major morbidity are rare outcomes with any of these techniques. Minor complications and technical failures appear to be more common with rings than clips. Electrocoagulation may be associated with less postoperative pain than the modified Pomeroy or tubal ring methods. Further research should include RCTs (for effectiveness) and controlled observational studies (for adverse effects) on sterilisation by minimally-invasive methods, i.e. tubal inserts and quinacrine.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-03 14:50:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of this review. The original version of the review was published in 2002 and the last update was published in <I>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 2</I>, 2011.</P>
<P>Female sterilisation, also called tubal ligation or tubal occlusion, is the most widely used contraceptive method in the world. Globally, in 2011, sterilisation accounted for approximately 19% of all contraceptive methods used by women between the ages of 15 and 49 years who were married or in a union, with the highest prevalences occurring in developing region (21%), and the lowest prevalences occurring in the least developed countries (3%) (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2013</LINK>). Female sterilisation is most prevalent in Latin America and the Carribean (26%) (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2013</LINK>). Figures published by the United Nations Population Division estimate prevalence rates for various other countries as follows: India 35.8%, China 28.7%, North America 22%, South Africa 14.3%, Germany 8.3%, United Kingdom 8%, France 3.8%, and Nigeria 0.3% (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2013</LINK>). The increased efficacy and acceptability of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs) has contributed in a trend towards declining sterilisation rates in some regions, e.g. the United Kingdom, in favour of LARCs.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-03 14:50:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Female sterilisation prevents pregnancy by occluding or disrupting tubal patency so that the ovum cannot reach the uterus. In the 1930s, Pomeroy made tubal sterilisation well known, however it was considered a major procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bhiwandiwala-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhiwandiwala 1980</LINK>). From 1950 to 1982 voluntary sterilisation increased thirty-fold worldwide, the increase partly being attributed to surgical innovations that made sterilisation a safe and effective outpatient procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bhiwandiwala-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhiwandiwala 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sterilisation failures (pregnancies) in the first year post-sterilisation of five per 1000 procedures are comparable with pregnancy rates for women using LARCs; however, tubal sterilisation appears to be a more effective contraceptive method over time (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2008</LINK>). This is probably due to high continuation rates compared with LARCs. Sterilisation failures may result from conception occurring before the procedure (so-called luteal phase pregnancy), incomplete tubal occlusion, or the formation of fistulas, and may occur several years after the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tubal sterilisation is traditionally achieved by an abdominal operation (either via laparotomy or laparoscopy). Tubal sterilisation techniques employed via the abdominal route include surgically cutting and tying the fallopian tubes (with or without a section of tube being removed), mechanically blocking the tubes using clips or rings, and electrically coagulating the tubes. Tubal sterilisation can also be achieved via the vaginal route by means of chemicals or mechanical tubal inserts that block the tubes by inducing a fibrotic reaction. Interventions such as hysterectomy or ovariectomy also lead to female sterility, but are not considered in this review as these operations are usually performed primarily for other medical reasons.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical methods</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of surgical techniques employed for interrupting tubal patency. Possibly the most common method of surgical sterilisation is a partial salpingectomy using the Pomeroy or 'modified' Pomeroy technique in which a chromic tie is placed around a loop of fallopian tube, and a 1 cm to 2 cm portion is then excised. The Parkland method involves separating a mid-portion of the tube from mesosalpinx and twice ligating the tube; the intervening segment between the ties is then resected, achieving immediate separation of the tubal ends. Alternatively, the Irving method double ties and divides the tube, then buries the proximal stump of the tube into the myometrium through an incision in the posterior uterine wall near the utero-tubal junction. The Uchida method involves infiltration of the serosa of the tube with a vasoconstricting solution with subsequent dissection of the subserosa and resection of a 2 cm portion of the muscular part of the tube; the proximal stump retracts into the mesosalpinx, which is closed, and the distal stump is exteriorised to the peritoneal cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2008</LINK>). Other methods and modifications include fimbriectomies and salpingectomies, e.g. Kroener, Madlener and Aldrich techniques. In a large, prospective cohort study (CREST) conducted in the United States between 1978 and 1992, interval (not within 42 days of pregnancy) and postpartum partial salpingectomy were associated with cumulative 10-year probabilities of pregnancy of 20.1 per 1000 and 7.5 per 1000 procedures, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mechanical methods</HEADING>
<P>Bands or rings made of silicone and rubber (e.g. Yoon, Falope) are placed around a loop of fallopian tube, using a cone-shaped applicator. When the ring is released onto the loop of tube, it contracts and constricts the base of the loop, thereby blocking the tube. The 2 cm to 3 cm loop undergoes necrosis and the healthy ends of the tube separate. Hinged clips (e.g. Filshie, Hulka) can also be used to block the fallopian tubes mechanically. Filshie clips are made of titanium and silicone rubber, while Hulka clips are made of plastic with a gold spring lock. Only a small portion of the tube is damaged when these devices are used (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 1992</LINK>), therefore their use might increase the chance of reversibility among women who experience regret (<LINK REF="REF-Hillis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillis 1999</LINK>). In the CREST study, tubal rings and clips were associated with cumulative 10-year probabilities of pregnancy of 17.7 per 1000 and 36.5 per 1000 procedures, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Electrical methods</HEADING>
<P>The standard laparoscopic technique for tubal occlusion by electrocoagulation originally used unipolar forceps, however, since the risk of burns to the bowel and other organs is decreased with the use of bipolar forceps, the latter are preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Kessel-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 1976</LINK>). With bipolar coagulation, the tube is grasped with the forceps, and electrical current passes between the two ends of the forceps, damaging the tube. To achieve successful occlusion it is recommended that at least 3 cm of the isthmic portion of the tube is coagulated (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2008</LINK>). Unipolar coagulation damages a wider segment of tube, which is often cut after coagulation. In the CREST study, unipolar and bipolar electrocoagulation were associated with cumulative 10-year probabilities of pregnancy of 7.5 per 1000 and 24.7 per 1000 procedures, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chemical methods</HEADING>
<P>Licensed as an antimalarial and in use for more than 70 years, quinacrine's use in sterilisation in low- and middle-income countries has been fraught with ethical issues (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharyya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharyya 2003</LINK>). However, a report on 40,252 cases of quinacrine sterilisation (QS) from Chile, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Libya, Syria, China, Costa Rica and the USA concluded that this is a safe and effective method (<LINK REF="REF-IJOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">IJOG 2003</LINK>). The method, involving the interuterine device-like insertion of quinacrine pellets trans-cervically into the uterus, leads to chemical irritation and scarring of the fallopian tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Suhadi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suhadi 1998</LINK>). QS does not immediately result in sterilisation, which can take up to 12 weeks, and failure rates appear to vary depending on dosage and the number of insertions (<LINK REF="REF-Agoestina-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agoestina 2003</LINK>). Two insertions one month apart seems to be the most common and effective method of QS, and results in reported gross pregnancy rates of 1.2% to 4.3% in 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suhadi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suhadi 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tubal inserts</HEADING>
<P>Essure® inserts are 4 cm devices consisting of a stainless steel inner coil coated with PET (polyethylene tenephterate), and a nickel titanium outer coil. According to the manufacturer, approximately 750,000 women have undergone Essure® sterilisation to date (<LINK REF="REF-Bayer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayer 2015</LINK>). To achieve sterilisation, these inserts are introduced bilaterally into the proximal fallopian tubes via hysteroscopy and expand on insertion. The PET fibres induce a tissue response that causes fibrosis of the tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Valle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valle 2001</LINK>). Bilateral occlusion must be verified, usually by hysterosalpingogram (HSG), three months postinsertion (<LINK REF="REF-Veersema-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veersema 2015</LINK>). Although other inserts have been developed (Adiana, Ovabloc), Essure® is currently the only tubal insert on the market. Successful bilateral placement varies from between 80% to 99% of first attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Arjona-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arjona 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savage-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shavell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shavell 2009</LINK>), and placement failure has been attributed mainly to related to poor visualisation of the tubal ostia or tubal spasm/stenosis on hysteroscopy, and operator experience (<LINK REF="REF-Mino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mino 2007</LINK>). Sterilisation failures may be mainly attributed to misinterpretation of the HSG and non-adherence to the follow-up protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Veersema-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veersema 2015</LINK>), although evidence from controlled studies is lacking.</P>

<P>Contraception plays a vital role in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, and the acceptability and satisfaction of women with contraceptive methods is increased when users are well-informed (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 2011</LINK>). This review considers the different techniques for tubal interruption, regardless of the method used to access the fallopian tubes, and evaluates them for their safety and effectiveness. Previous versions of this review identified no eligible studies of chemical or hysteroscopic methods that could be included in the review. Given the evolving nature of sterilisation methods, and contraception in general, it is important that we keep this review updated.</P>

<P>The 2002 and 2010 versions of this review utilised older Cochrane methodology for assessing risk of bias that involved an A, B, C system of assessing bias and excluded studies with poor allocation concealment (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). For this updated review we reviewed previous exclusions and, where possible, updated the 'Risk of bias' assessment of previously included studies. For this version of the review (and future versions), risk of bias has been assessed according to the following criteria:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each study we assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random-number table; computer random-number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); though quasi-randomised studies are not eligible for inclusion in the review;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (if the process of sequence generation was not described).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (if the process of was not described).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (checking for possible performance and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the methods used, if any, to blind study participants, personnel and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analyses. We recorded whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (e.g. withdrawals not stated, denominators not given).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<P>The risk of bias of included studies is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Most studies were older studies with an unclear risk of bias as information about study methods was often missing from trial reports. Randomisation and allocation concealment was inadequately described in 50% of the studies. Blinding of the outcome assessor was described in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aranda-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aranda-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Argueta-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Argueta 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gentile-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gentile 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koetsawang-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Koetsawang 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pymar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pymar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attrition bias was serious in two studies: in <LINK REF="STD-Geirsson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Geirsson 1985</LINK>, nine women were excluded post-procedure "due to intra-operative difficulties" that were not described in detail, while in <LINK REF="STD-Aranda-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 1985</LINK>, 30 cases of technical failure (5% of total) were excluded from the analyses. It was not clear from which groups these women came, and we were unable to include these data on technical failures in the review. Postrandomisation exclusions due to protocol violations occurred with similar frequency in the <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1982" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1982</LINK> trial (about 12% in the Pomeroy group and about 10% in the electrocoagulation group); however, there were also important differences in baseline characteristics and methods of accessing the tubes between arms of this trial, which may have had an impact on the results.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:17:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Altogether we included 19 RCTs involving 13,209 women requesting sterilisation. Sterilisation was performed on an interval basis in most trials, apart from three RCTs of postpartum sterilisation involving 1632 women. RCTs compared tubal rings versus clips (six RCTs, 4232 women), partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation (three RCTs, 2019 women), tubal rings versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 599 women), partial salpingectomy versus clips (four RCTs, 3627 women), clips versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 206 women) and Hulka versus Filshie clips (2 RCTs, 2326 women). The RCTs of clips versus electrocoagulation contributed no data to analyses. Studies of postpartum sterilisation compared partial salpingectomy with clips. No RCTs compared tubal inserts (hysteroscopic sterilisation) to other methods.</P>
<P>The main findings are summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>. One year after sterilisation, failure rates were comparable for tubal rings and clips (high-quality evidence), partial salpingectomy and clips (high-quality evidence), and for partial salpingectomy and electrocoagulation (low-quality evidence). Estimates of failure rates for these methods were less than five pregnancies per 1000 procedures in the first year post-sterilisation, and longer-term pregnancy rates were generally not reported.</P>
<P>No deaths were reported as a results of the procedures in any of the studies. Major morbidity was rare with 22 events reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aranda-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aranda-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1982" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1982</LINK>), 17 events occurred with partial salpingectomy, four with electrocoagulation, and one with a clip procedure.</P>
<P>Minor morbidity occurred twice as often with tubal rings than with tubal clips (high-quality evidence) and technical failures were also significantly more common with rings than clips (high-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in postoperative pain between these groups (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Major and minor morbidity occurred more frequently with partial salpingectomy than with electrocoagulation for interval sterilisation (low- to moderate-quality evidence; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Postoperative pain (up to 24 hours) was also significantly more common in the partial salpingectomy group than with electrocoagulation (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in major or minor morbidity when tubal rings were compared with electrocoagulation for interval sterilisation (low- to moderate-quality evidence; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Evidence relating to technical failures was of a low quality for this comparison. Significantly more women undergoing sterilisation by tubal ring complained of postoperative pain in the first 24 hours compared with those in the electrocoagulation group (low-quality evidence); however, this difference did not persist to the follow-up visit.</P>
<P>For partial salpingectomy versus tubal clips, one large study reported no major morbidity with either method (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). We found limited data on minor morbidity suggesting that there may be little difference between groups (low-quality evidence). Evidence suggested that technical failures were more frequent with clip sterilisation (moderate-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in patients' complaints at follow-up in the one large study that reported this outcome (moderate-quality evidence). Pooled data from two studies indicated that operative time was shorter on average with the clip technique than with partial salpingectomy (high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Hulka and Filshie clips were comparable in most outcomes for which there were data (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>), except that technical difficulties occurred more frequently in the Hulka clip group (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>We found little evidence about women's and surgeons' satisfaction for any of the comparisons.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-03 11:06:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found a fairly substantial body of evidence indicating that various established techniques for interrupting tubal patency, including partial salpingectomy, electrocoagulation, and use of tubal clips and rings, are safe and effective methods. As studies utilising electrocoagulation did not always state whether unipolar or bipolar coagulation was used, we were unable to draw differential conclusions regarding these methods; however, major morbidity attributed to electrocoagulation in the included studies was very low. We found no RCTs that compared sterilisation by tubal inserts (hysteroscopic sterilisation) with other methods, so more evidence on the safety and efficacy of this relatively new method is needed.</P>
<P>The short duration of follow-up in the RCTs included in this review, which was usually one or two years, limits the evidence on failure (pregnancy) rates. In addition, failure rates were possibly underestimated due to high losses to follow-up in those RCTs that reported a two-year follow-up.Thus, data on longer-term failure rates may best be derived from the CREST study (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1996</LINK>). Cumulative evidence from this prospective cohort study found that the 10-year probability of pregnancy was highest after clip sterilisation (36.5/1000 procedures) and lowest for postpartum partial salpingectomy (7.5/1000) and unipolar coagulation (7.5/1000). Tubal ring was the most common sterilisation technique in the CREST cohort and was associated with a 10-year probability of pregnancy of 17.7/1000 procedures. The one-year and 10-year probabilities of pregnancy with any procedure was 5.5 /1000 and 18.5/1000 procedures, respectively. Younger women (18 to 27 years) undergoing sterilisation by bipolar coagulation were at greatest risk of sterilisation failure within ten years of the procedure (54.3/1000 procedures).</P>
<P>We did not try to determine the relative effects of different types of anaesthetic methods (local, spinal, general anaesthesia and other) on women's sterilisation experience, including postoperative pain, and this could be the subject of a separate review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:13:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We graded the quality of the main findings of the review using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The quality of the evidence relating to tubal rings versus clips was mainly high. For the evidence related to partial salpingectomy compared with electrocoagulation, we downgraded the evidence quality to low or moderate due to imprecision or indirectness, as the findings may have been due to the access approach rather than the tubal occlusion technique (partial salpingectomy was mainly performed via minilaparotomy, whereas electrocoagulation was performed via laparoscopy). We downgraded the quality of the evidence relating to tubal rings versus electrocoagulation for most outcomes, most frequently due to imprecision of the effect.</P>
<P>We graded the evidence relating to partial salpingectomy versus tubal clips mainly as moderate due to imprecision or risk of bias. Evidence on minor morbidity for this comparison was very sparse and imprecise, hence we downgraded it to low quality evidence. For the comparison of Filshie and Hulka clips, evidence was mainly of a low to moderate quality due to imprecision, with or without other factors.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:13:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original review was performed in 2002 using old Cochrane methods for classifying studies and assessing risk of bias. For this update, we revised the methodology to conform with current Cochrane methods for 'Risk of bias' assessment, resulting in the inclusion of three RCTs that had been excluded from previous versions of the review. Two of these studies contributed little (<LINK REF="STD-Geirsson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Geirsson 1985</LINK>), or no (<LINK REF="STD-Goynumer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Goynumer 2009</LINK>), data. In addition, we identified two RCTs using the related articles feature of PubMed, which should have been included in earlier versions of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Dominik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dominik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siegle 2005</LINK>). Due to resource constraints we did not re-extract the missing risk of bias details from previously included studies for this update.</P>
<P>For the comparison 'partial salpingectomy versus clips', we pooled data from two RCTs that used different methods for partial salpingectomy (modified Pomeroy and Uchida methods) and different clip methods (titanium and silver clips; see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>) and performed subgroup analysis to compare these findings. The test for subgroup differences indicated no difference, however, these subgroup analyses were not pre-specified in the protocol. This subgrouping also served to distinguish between studies according to the timing of the procedure, i.e. postpartum and interval sterilisation, which similarly indicated no significant difference in findings according to the procedure timing.</P>
<P>Although we noted when studies were at moderate or high risk of bias for specific outcomes, we did not perform sensitivity analysis, because few studies contributed to most analyses; however, we downgraded results accordingly in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
<P>We found no RCTs comparing types of tubal inserts or comparing tubal inserts with other methods of interrupting tubal patency; however, we found one RCT comparing two methods of accessing the fallopian tubes (vaginoscopy compared with hysteroscopy) to insert Essure inserts (<LINK REF="STD-Chapa-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Chapa 2015</LINK>). Studies comparing methods of accessing the tubes are not included in this review. Abdominal approaches (minilaparotomy versus laparoscopy) for female sterilisation are the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Kulier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulier 2004</LINK>) and, similarly, studies comparing methods of vaginal approaches to hysteroscopic sterisation should be considered in a separate Cochrane review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from newly included studies support the previous findings of this review, that tubal sterilisation by most established methods is an effective and safe procedure. Evidence relating to postoperative pain was limited in our review; however, for the comparison of partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation, and tubal rings versus electrocoagulation, moderate-quality evidence indicated that there was less postoperative pain with electrocoagulation. A recent review of RCTs of local anaesthesia to reduce postoperative pain following interval laparoscopic sterilisation found that the intraoperative application of local anaesthetic to the tubes significantly reduced postoperative pain for ring and clip sterilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2014</LINK>). In addition, a protocol for a Cochrane Review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for pain relief in women undergoing postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal sterilisation has recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2015</LINK>). This review should help further towards improving the experience of women requesting this popular form of contraception.</P>
<P>We found no RCTs of hysteroscopic sterilisation compared with other methods of sterilisation. Hysteroscopic sterilisation with tubal inserts has several advantages over older techniques in that the procedure avoids the peritoneal cavity, requires no incisions, usually requires no anaesthesia, may be well tolerated, and is usually performed as an outpatient procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 2008</LINK>). In the USA, hysteroscopic sterilisation with Essure® is reported to be rapidly replacing laparoscopic sterilisation and is potentially associated with lower cost (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 2009</LINK>). User satisfaction rates are reported to be high (<LINK REF="REF-Arjona-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arjona 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chudnoff-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chudnoff 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2007</LINK>), however, placement failure rates vary and long-term efficacy has still to be established. Two systematic reviews of non-randomised studies were unable to calculate the cumulative probability of pregnancy with Essure® due to limitations in available data (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-la-Chapelle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">la Chapelle 2015</LINK>). One found 'fair-quality evidence' that pregnancy was rare in women with documented bilateral tubal occlusion at three months after the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2013</LINK>); the other reported a cumulative three-year probability of pregnancy with Adiana (no longer available) of 16/1000 procedures (<LINK REF="REF-la-Chapelle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">la Chapelle 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gariepy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gariepy 2014</LINK> used an evidence-based Markov model to estimate the relative probability of pregnancy over 10 years following sterilisation with three methods - Essure®, the silicone ring, and bipolar coagulation - and estimated pregnancy probabilities of 96, 24 and 30 per 1000 women, respectively, with the highest risk of pregnancy after Essure® sterilisation occurring in the first year post-procedure (57 per 1000 women). This estimate considered the complete clinical pathways of the procedures, taking into account uncertainties regarding placement success, hysterosalpingogram (HSG) follow-up, and successful tubal occlusion, and therefore possibly reflects the 'real-life' situation. Other recent reports of Essure® sterilisation include a prospective study that reported no pregnancies in 449 women with successful bilateral placement and confirmed occlusion who completed the five-year follow-up (71% of cohort; <LINK REF="REF-Chudnoff-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chudnoff 2015</LINK>), and a retrospective cohort study of 109,277 women who underwent sterilisation by Essure® (39,169 women) or laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures (70,108 women) in France between 2006 and 2010 reporting pregnancy rates of 0.36% and 0.45%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>More data are needed on the short- and long-term side-effects of hysteroscopic sterilisation relative to other methods. In <LINK REF="REF-Chudnoff-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chudnoff 2015</LINK>, intermenstrual bleeding occurred among 23.6% of women during the first three months postprocedure, 20% of women (74/386) reported heavier menses at the five-year follow-up visit; 5.3% (25/473) experienced recurrent pelvic pain, and 15 women underwent hysterectomy during the five-year follow-up period (apparently only two were possibly attributable to Essure®). <LINK REF="REF-Ouzounelli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouzounelli 2015</LINK> conducted a review of hysteroscopic sterilisation compared with laparoscopic tubal ligation and found that both had low rates of complications, although complications related to Essure® procedures were "more likely to be minor in nature". Another review concluded that "the incidence and severity of complications with hysteroscopic sterilisation has not been adequately studied and remains unclear" (<LINK REF="REF-la-Chapelle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">la Chapelle 2015</LINK>). A review by <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2010</LINK> found that the vaginoscopic approach (whereby hysteroscopy is performed without a vaginal speculum or cervical instruments to grasp the cervix) may be associated with less pain than traditional hysteroscopic sterilisation techniques with no difference in the number of failed procedures.</P>
<P>One of the obvious limitations of hysteroscopic sterilisation at present is the delay in achieving its occlusive effect and the need for confirmatory testing at three months. A new iteration of the Essure® insert designed to achieve immediate tubal occlusion appears to show promise in this regard, and may reduce pre-HSG pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Thiel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiel 2014</LINK>). A search of clinical trial registries at the time of writing (31 July 2015) found no registered or ongoing RCTs comparing hysteroscopic methods with more widely used methods.</P>
<P>No RCTs investigating the safety and effectiveness of quinacrine sterilisation, which is used unlicensed in some regions, have been conducted or registered. Due to its low cost, easy application, apparent safety, and comparable effectiveness, a call has been made recently for the use of quinacrine in low- and middle-income countries to be reconsidered (<LINK REF="REF-Lippes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippes 2015</LINK>). Concerns about the mutagenicity of quinacrine have not been supported by epidemiological evidence from extensive human studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lippes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippes 2015</LINK>), with at least two large studies finding no association between quinacrine sterilisation (QS) and the risk of gynaecological cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Sokal-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokal 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sokal-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokal 2010b</LINK>). Furthermore, studies conducted in China and Iran have reported that QS is more acceptable to women than surgical sterilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soroodi_x002d_Moghaddam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soroodi-Moghaddam 2003</LINK>). A large, well-conducted RCT of this inexpensive, minimally-invasive method could be important.</P>

<P>Failure rates at 12 months post-sterilisation and major morbidity were found to be rare outcomes with sterilisation by partial salpingectomy, electrocoagulation, clips, and tubal rings. Technical failures were more common with tubal rings compared with clips, and more common with clips compared with partial salpingectomy. The choice of the tubal occlusion technique should include consideration of the costs, equipment availability, the setting and the surgeon's experience. We were unable to draw any conclusions about the relative efficacy and safety of hysteroscopic sterilisation and more research is needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-03 11:05:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs comparing hysteroscopic sterilisation methods, e.g. Essure®, with laparoscopic (and other) methods are needed. To assess adverse effects, controlled observational studies of sterilisation by minimally invasive methods would also be of value. Women's satisfaction, side-effects, and cost are important outcomes for future RCTs. Women in their forties without hormonal treatment may experience more dysfunctional uterine bleeding, which is often treated with hormonally-impregnated intrauterine systems (<LINK REF="REF-French-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2004</LINK>); studies evaluating differences in long-term effectiveness and adverse effects between hysteroscopic sterilisation methods and IUSs, especially among women over 40 years of age, are therefore of interest. Given that quinacrine sterilisation is cheap, minimally invasive, and in use in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lippes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippes 2015</LINK>), a trial of quinacrine compared with hysteroscopic sterilisation would be very informative. Further comparative trials of abdominally accessed sterilisation methods are not considered to be a high priority for research.</P>
