<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Behavioral interventions can reduce unprotected sex among men who have sex with men (MSM).</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Interventions to reduce unprotected sex include individual counseling, social and behavioral support (such as peer education, assertiveness and relationship support, discussing attitudes and beliefs, videos). Small group and community interventions include group counseling or workshops, interventions in community areas, training community leaders, and community-building empowerment activities. The review found that these behavioral interventions can lead to significant risk reduction in MSM.</P>
<P>Continued research is needed to identify which behavioral strategies are most effective in reducing transmission, and which intervention components are most effective in influencing those behaviors. More research is also needed on the most effective strategies for non-white MSM in wealthy countries, as well as for MSM in developing countries.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain at great risk for HIV infection. Program planners and policy makers need descriptions of interventions and quantitative estimates of intervention effects to make informed decisions concerning prevention funding and research. The number of intervention strategies for MSM that have been examined with strong research designs has increased substantially in the past few years.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To locate and describe outcome studies evaluating the effects of behavioral HIV prevention interventions for MSM.<BR/>2. To summarize the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unprotected anal sex.<BR/>3. To identify study characteristics associated with effectiveness.<BR/>4. To identify gaps and indicate future research, policy, and practice needs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched electronic databases, current journals, manuscripts submitted by researchers, bibliographies of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and other reviews for published and unpublished reports from 1988 through December 2007. We also asked researchers working in HIV prevention about new and ongoing studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were considered in scope if they examined the effects of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing risk for HIV or STD transmission among MSM. We reviewed studies in scope for criteria of outcome relevance (measurement of at least one of a list of behavioral or biologic outcomes, e.g., unprotected sex or incidence of HIV infections) and methodologic rigor (randomized controlled trials or certain strong quasi-experimental designs with comparison groups).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We used fixed and random effects models to summarize rate ratios (RR) comparing intervention and control groups with respect to count outcomes (number of occasions of or partners for unprotected anal sex), and corresponding prevalence ratios (PR) for dichotomous outcomes (any unprotected anal sex vs. none). We used published formulas to convert effect sizes and their variances for count and dichotomous outcomes where necessary. We accounted for intraclass correlation (ICC) in community-level studies and adjusted for baseline conditions in all studies. We present separate results by intervention format (small group, individual, or community-level) and by type of intervention delivered to the comparison group (minimal or no HIV prevention in the comparison condition versus standard or other HIV prevention in the comparison condition). We examine rate ratios stratified according to characteristics of participants, design, implementation, and intervention content. For small group and individual-level interventions we used a stepwise selection process to identify a multivariable model of predictors of reduction in occasions of or partners for unprotected anal sex. We used funnel plots to examine publication bias, and Q (a chi-squared statistic with degrees of freedom = number of interventions minus 1) to test for heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found 44 studies evaluating 58 interventions with 18,585 participants. Formats included 26 small group interventions, 21 individual-level interventions, and 11 community-level interventions. Sixteen of the 58 interventions focused on HIV-positives. The 40 interventions that were measured against minimal to no HIV prevention intervention reduced occasions of or partners for unprotected anal sex by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15% to 37%). The other 18 interventions reduced unprotected anal sex by 17% beyond changes observed in standard or other interventions (CI = 5% to 27%).</P>
<P>Intervention effects were statistically homogeneous, and no independent variable was statistically significantly associated with intervention effects at alpha=.05. However, a multivariable model selected by backward stepwise elimination identified four study characteristics associated with reduction in occasions of or partners for unprotected anal sex among small group and individual-level interventions at alpha=.10. The most favorable reductions in episodes of or partners for unprotected anal sex (33% to 35% decreases) were observed among studies with count outcomes, those with shorter intervention spans (&lt;=1 month), those with better retention in the intervention condition than in the comparison condition, and those with minimal to no HIV prevention intervention delivered to the comparison condition.</P>
<P>Because there were only 11 community-level studies we did not search for a multivariable model for community-level interventions. In stratified analyses including only one variable at a time, the greatest reductions (40% to 54% decreases) in number of episodes of or partners for unprotected anal sex among community-level interventions were observed among studies where groups were assigned randomly rather than by convenience, studies with shorter recall periods and longer follow-up, studies with more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM, studies in which at least 90% of participants were white, and studies in which the intervention addressed development of personal skills.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. </P>
<P>Results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.</P>
<P>When effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).</P>
<P>Among small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.</P>
<P>When effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.</P>
<P>Among community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.</P>
<P>The greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.</P>
<P>Further research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Behavioral prevention remains central to the effort to reduce HIV transmission. Although antiretroviral therapy has tremendous life-saving potential, it is expensive, does not cure, and may have debilitating side effects for some people [<LINK REF="REF-Conant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conant 2004</LINK>]. Risk behaviors may increase if people believe that new treatments reduce subsequent transmission [<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2003</LINK>] or if a vaccine becomes available [<LINK REF="REF-Crosby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosby 2006</LINK>]. Recent vaccine trials have yielded discouraging results [<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Markel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markel 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Garber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2004</LINK>].</P>
<P>MSM continue to make up the largest proportion of new AIDS cases and HIV infections each year in Pattern I countries [<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS.org" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS.org</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Catania-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catania 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1997</LINK>]. Of the estimated 322,125 male adults and adolescents living with AIDS in the United States in 2005, 67% had been exposed through male-to-male sexual contact, including 8% who had been exposed through both male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use [<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK> page 8]. </P>
<P>MSM are at high risk among all races and ethnicities. Among 30,956 cases of AIDS reported among men and male adolescents in the United States in 2005 [<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK> table 19], 53% were MSM or MSM-IDU. By race and ethnicity, 73% of AIDS diagnoses reported among white men, 40% among black men, 49% among Hispanic men, 58% among Asian men, and 63% among American Indian or Alaska/Hawaii native men were MSM or MSM-IDU. These cases and new infections are concentrated in a group believed to constitute only 2% to 10% of the adult male population [<LINK REF="REF-Binson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binson 1995</LINK>].</P>
<P>And in contrast to trends reported in the 1990s, the burden among MSM is now increasing faster than among other populations. The estimated yearly number of new diagnoses of HIV or AIDS among MSM and MSM/IDU in the 33 states with named reporting increased by 11% from 17,699 in 2001 to 19,620 in 2005, while decreasing by 20% among all other people in these 33 states [<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK> table 1].</P>
<P>MSM are at high risk for HIV infection in the developing world as well. A systematic review in low- and middle-income countries found a weighted average HIV prevalence of 12.8% among MSM [<LINK REF="REF-Baral-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baral 2007</LINK>]. Compared to other reproductive-age adults, the odds of HIV infection among MSM were 33 times greater in Latin America, 19 times greater in Asia, and 3.8 times greater in Africa, but only 1.3 times greater in Eastern Europe, where contaminated injections play a critical role in the epidemic.</P>
<P>Unprotected anal sex remains the greatest risk factor identified for HIV transmission. A case-control study in Australia found that the odds of becoming infected with HIV were 57 times as great among men who reported receptive anal sex to ejaculation with casual partners without a condom as among men who did not [<LINK REF="REF-Read-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 2007</LINK>]. However risks from sex with main partners, insertive sex, and sex without ejaculation were not ruled out.</P>
<P>Partner selection based on perceived serostatus is being used as a strategy for risk reduction among MSM but carries some risk [<LINK REF="REF-Rietmeijer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rietmeijer 2007</LINK>]. Among 2788 MSM ages 23-29 in 6 US cities, 267 (9.6%) had HIV and were not aware of their status [<LINK REF="REF-MacKellar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKellar 2007</LINK>]. The proportion who were infected but not aware was particularly high among African American MSM at 28%, compared to 8% among Hispanic MSM and 4% among white MSM. Since those most recently infected may be most infectious and least likely to know of their status, reliance on partners' awareness and disclosure of their own serostatus may be a risky strategy [<LINK REF="REF-Wawer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wawer 2005</LINK>].</P>
<P>Previous reviews of HIV prevention efforts have examined the effects of behavioral interventions across multiple populations at risk. Fisher and Fisher [<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-JD-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher JD 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-JD-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher JD 2006a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-JD-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher JD 2006b</LINK>] concluded that critical intervention components included not only information but also motivation and skills. Choi and Coates [<LINK REF="STD-Choi-1996_x0040_" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 1996@</LINK>] noted the importance of skills training, as well as a lack of intervention research for MSM of color, young MSM, and non-gay-identifying MSM. Holtgrave et al. [<LINK REF="REF-Holtgrave-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtgrave 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Holtgrave-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtgrave 2007</LINK>] cited the need for sufficient resources, intensity, and cultural competency, and a basis in behavioral and social science theory and previous research. Oakley et al. [<LINK REF="REF-Oakley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 1995</LINK>] identified a need for stronger research designs. Stephenson et al. [<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2000</LINK>] reported that successful interventions were characterized by extensive formative research or high attendance rates.</P>
<P>One review not specific to MSM included a meta-analysis of 12 intervention studies: Kalichman et al. [<LINK REF="REF-Kalichman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalichman 1996</LINK>] found that intervention effects diminished across studies as time from intervention to follow-up increased from 1 to 6 months. One qualitative review focusing specifically on men who have sex with men [<LINK REF="REF-Kegeles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kegeles 1998</LINK>] noted that community-based interventions have the capacity to reach people who would not participate in facility-based interventions, and who may be at higher risk than many who enroll in small group or individual interventions.</P>
<P>Effects of behavioral interventions for MSM have now been evaluated in numerous randomized trials and strong quasi-experimental studies. Quantitative synthesis can help to optimize the usefulness and interpretability of results across studies. Our first meta-analyses of HIV prevention interventions for MSM through 1997 found a 26% reduction in unprotected anal sex compared to neutral or standard conditions [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002a</LINK>, and previous Cochrane review]. Our update to those reviews found a 27% reduction in unprotected anal sex in 38 interventions compared to neutral conditions and a 17% reduction in 16 interventions compared to standard conditions [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>].</P>
<P>Another meta-analysis of interventions for MSM found favorable effects among 17 studies that reported a basis in behavioral theory (odds ratio = .65) and no effect among 3 that did not (odds ratio = 1.03) [<LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2005</LINK>]. A meta-analysis of 19 studies meeting narrower criteria (e.g., MSM age 20 and older not known to be HIV-positive, as well as sample size, retention rates, and other criteria of design, implementation, and reporting) also found significant favorable effects [<LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007</LINK>]. This Cochrane Review further updates the list of studies meeting the criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>In this review we examine and summarize the behavioral effects of rigorously evaluated interventions for MSM. To the extent that data permit, we estimate several parameters needed by program planners and policymakers [<LINK REF="REF-Holtgrave-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtgrave 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bulterys-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bulterys 1997</LINK>].</P>
<P>Our research questions were: <BR/>1. What behavioral interventions to reduce risk of HIV transmission among MSM have been tested in randomized trials or in rigorously controlled quasi-experimental studies? <BR/>2. What populations have been served or underserved in these studies? <BR/>3. What are the effects of MSM interventions contrasted against minimal or no intervention comparison conditions?<BR/>4. What are the effects of MSM interventions contrasted against standard or other HIV prevention intervention conditions?<BR/>5. What are the effects of small group, individual-, and community-level interventions for MSM?<BR/>6. What characteristics of small group and individual-level intervention studies are most closely associated with magnitude of effects in a multivariable model?<BR/>7. What characteristics of community-level intervention studies are most closely associated with magnitude of effects in single-variable models?</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We reviewed studies for scope based on types of participants (MSM) and interventions (behavioral interventions to prevent HIV or STDs). We reviewed studies in scope for relevance based on inclusion of specified outcome measures (HIV or STD incidence or HIV risk behaviors), and for methodological rigor based on study design (randomized controlled trials and certain quasi-experimental designs).</P>
<P>Non-randomized studies were considered eligible only if they included independent comparison groups where assignment to treatment status was not based on need or volition, and separate baseline measurements were also taken, as in the Untreated Control Group Design with Pretest and Posttest [<LINK REF="REF-Cook-_x0026_-Campbell" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook &amp; Campbell</LINK>, pp 103-118]. Examples of studies that were <I>not</I> eligible were those that compared:<BR/>- people who chose to participate in an intervention to those who did not, <BR/>- baseline and follow-up measures with no separate comparison condition, <BR/>- only follow-up measures without baseline measures when either individuals or groups were assigned to treatment condition by a non-random process.</P>
<P>In a change from our previous Cochrane review, we did not include studies with the recurrent institutional cycle design which features data collection at only one time point for the comparison group.</P>
<P>We excluded a non-randomized study in which large community agencies were chosen for intervention and small agencies for the control condition. We did not exclude studies on the basis of chance differences between intervention and comparison groups in demographics and baseline distribution of the outcome variable. We used results with appropriate statistical controls for such characteristics where available.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>MSM regardless of age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation (gay / homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual), gender identity (including transsexuals), nationality, etc. We included only studies in which MSM constituted at least one-third of the study sample (e.g., HIV-seropositives) or were specifically targeted by the intervention. When other populations were included, we either obtained outcome data for the MSM subset or reduced the study weight to reflect only the proportion who were MSM.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Behavioral or social interventions designed to promote sexual risk reduction and thereby to reduce transmission of HIV or other STDs. These interventions may be delivered to individuals, small groups, or communities. </P>
<P>We excluded interventions that focused not on sexual transmission but on cognitive or affective outcomes such as distress associated with HIV testing, or health and coping for seropositive men [<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 2003</LINK>]. We also excluded pharmaceutical interventions.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We included only studies that measured intervention effects on behaviors understood to affect risk of HIV transmission (e.g., unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners) and biologic outcomes including incidence of infection by HIV or other STD.</P>
<P>We defined unprotected sex as anal intercourse without a condom. Data concerning other sexual and drug use behaviors were frequently not available. Because unprotected anal sex is the most epidemiologically pertinent behavior for MSM [<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Leary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Leary 1997</LINK>] and was available for all studies, we restricted our analyses to this outcome.</P>
<P>Dichotomous measures reflect the proportion of respondents reporting any unprotected sex during the recall period. Count-level outcomes reflect the number of occasions of unprotected sex or the number of partners for unprotected sex during the recall period. Methods for managing multiple outcomes are described below under Calculation of effect sizes and Statistical analyses.</P>
<P>HIV and STD incidence were reported in only a few studies so we did not perform quantitative analyses of these outcomes.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 16:28:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>We systematically reviewed the HIV prevention literature to find studies measuring the effects of behavioral interventions for MSM [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sogolow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sogolow 2002</LINK>]. Resources included online databases (Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed, AIDSLine, Web of Science, ERIC, EMBASE, Social Science Citation Index, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Cochrane Library Controlled Clinical Trials Register, the National Research Register, and the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects [CRISP] database), reviews and other studies in the HIV prevention literature, expert recommendation, hand searches of journals (AIDS, AIDS and Behavior, AIDS Care, AIDS Education and Prevention, American Journal of Public Health, International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, AIDS Patient Care and STDs), and manuscripts and unpublished reports submitted by researchers. We did not restrict searches by country or language. The references of the eligible articles were also searched, a process that was iterated until no new references were identified. We also reviewed the citations from prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses for possible references. We also sent requests for information to researchers funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH), and contacted experts and agencies who could provide relevant materials.</P>
<P>Keywords for electronic searches varied according to database. As an example, a search of the 1996-2007 Medline database in December 2007 for (AIDS/prevention &amp; control [pc] or HIV infections/pc or sexually transmitted diseases/pc) yielded 17,085 citations [ <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>]. A search for (homosexuality or bisexuality or gay.mp or bisexual.mp or men who have sex with men.mp or HIV seropositivity/psychology) yielded 7967 citations, and a search for (random allocation or intervention studies or program evaluation or random.mp or randomize.mp or randomized.mp or randomly.mp) yielded 347,740 citations. Most quasi-experimental studies included the terms "intervention studies" or "program evaluation." There were 121 citations that were included in all three searches. Review of these 121 led to identification of 22 trials that were eligible by the criteria described below. Other search methods as well as analogous searches of other databases led to identification of 44 total studies evaluating 58 experimental interventions.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 16:30:58 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Studies found relevant and rigorous were eligible for the review. Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were independently abstracted from relevant studies by two reviewers using standardized data abstraction forms. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Calculation of effect sizes</B>
</P>
<P>For each study, we calculated two effect sizes: a rate ratio (RR) and a prevalence ratio (PR). Because eligible studies used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, rate ratios (RR) can be used to estimate intervention effects for count measures and prevalence ratios (PR) for dichotomous measures [<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Reviewers_x0027_-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>]. We could have chosen standardized mean differences and odds ratios instead, but rate ratios and prevalence ratios have the advantage of being directly interpreted as 1 minus the net change. For example, a rate ratio of .73 indicates a 27% reduction in episodes of or partners for unprotected sex in the intervention condition after accounting for change in the comparison condition.</P>
<P>For each study that reported count measures, the rate ratio at follow-up was the ratio of the mean number of occasions of or partners for unprotected sex in the intervention group to the mean number in the comparison group. Similarly the prevalence ratio at follow-up was the ratio of the proportion of respondents reporting unprotected sex in the intervention group to the proportion in the comparison group. Rate ratios and prevalence ratios less than one represented a difference favoring the experimental intervention group. For each measure, the natural logarithm (LnRR or LnPR) was then an estimate of the intervention effect. The reciprocal of the variance of the logarithm of the measure served as a measure of the weight of information provided by the study.</P>
<P>When individual-level data were available, we used SAS Proc Genmod (except for group-randomized trials) to estimate rate ratios and prevalence ratios adjusted for the baseline value of covariates such as the outcome variable, age, race/ethnicity, and serostatus. For rate ratios, we used the negative binomial distribution and the log link function and adjusted the scale for Pearson's chi-square divided by its degrees of freedom. For prevalence ratios, we used the binomial distribution and the log link function.</P>
<P>When individual-level data or adjusted statistics were not available, we adjusted for the baseline distribution of the outcome variable by subtracting the baseline effect size (LnRR or LnPR) from the follow-up effect size. We used the lesser of the baseline and follow-up weights for such studies.</P>
<P>In studies where communities are the unit of assignment to treatment, the variance of the intervention effect will be underestimated and the weight (the reciprocal of the variance) will be overestimated if intraclass correlation (ICC) is not accounted for [<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1998</LINK>]. We derived the adjustment factor to reduce study weights where necessary to account for ICC. For small values of ICC, the adjustment factor is approximately equal to Donner's variance inflation factor (VIF): 1 + ICC × (m - 1) where m is the number of subjects in each unit of assignment. We assumed an ICC of .005, the value observed in the one study for which ICC was published [<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1997</LINK>].</P>
<P>We used outcome variables that did not distinguish between insertive and receptive sex, main and nonmain partners, or partners perceived to be seroconcordant vs. serodiscordant when such data were available. For studies from which the only available results were separated by insertive vs. receptive sex, or main vs. nonmain partners, we used the average point estimate and the average weight of the two measures to estimate the underlying combined effect [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002b</LINK>]. We accepted results concerning only nonmain, serodiscordant, or unknown serostatus partners when results were not available concerning main or seroconcordant partners.</P>
<P>For studies that compared two or more experimental interventions against a single control group, we allocated the control group into equal parts for comparison to each of the interventions. This strategy uses each individual's response only once and is thus valid for calculation of summary effects in fixed effects models. If this strategy had been necessary for several large studies, it could bias heterogeneity statistics toward a finding of homogeneity. If results had been heterogeneous, necessitating use of random effects models, the apparent variances could be understated. However the strategy was necessary for only a few small studies, and results would still have been homogeneous if these studies were left out altogether.</P>
<P>For studies that reported outcomes at multiple time points, the most commonly used follow-up times were 6 and 12 months after the end of the intervention. In order to focus on more sustained intervention effects, we selected outcomes measured closest to 12 months after intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical Analysis</B>
</P>
<P>We applied the standard procedures for meta-analysis to conduct summary, stratified, and regression analyses [<LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1994</LINK>]. We conducted separate summary meta-analyses for rate ratios and prevalence ratios. In order to include all studies in each analysis, we substituted prevalence ratios for rate ratios in studies that measured only dichotomous outcomes (these are indicated by the at-sign @ in citations below, in the table of included studies, and in figures), and vice versa in studies that measured only count outcomes (these are indicated by the pound-sign #). If the prevalence ratio is constant across cutpoints then the rate ratio equals the prevalence ratio. This assumption of constancy across cutpoints is analogous to the assumption used to justify transformation between log odds ratios and standardized mean differences in other meta-analyses [<LINK REF="REF-Hasselblad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasselblad 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chinn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002b</LINK>].</P>
<P>Variances (and therefore weights) differ substantially between count and dichotomous outcomes and are not interchangeable between rate ratios and prevalence ratios. We used the method of moments to develop an estimate of the variance of LnRR when only dichotomous data were available, and the variance of LnPR when only count data were available [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>].</P>
<P>Because intervention effects were highly homogeneous, random- and fixed-effects models yielded identical results for most analyses [<LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>]. Variance estimates under the random effects model are always greater than or equal to those observed under the fixed effects model; in this sense the random effects model is conservative. But estimates of the summary intervention effect can be exaggerated by the random effects model in some circumstances, and in this sense the random effects model can be even more strongly anti-conservative. In our analyses, summary variances were almost indistinguishable between the two models, but summary effect estimates were occasionally farther from the null (smaller) under the random effects model. Thus the results according to fixed effects models are more conservative for these data, and they are the only ones we present.</P>
<P>We hypothesized <I>a priori</I> that interventions contrasted against neutral comparison conditions (minimal or no treatment related to HIV risk reduction) would yield stronger effects than those contrasted against active comparison conditions (standard or other HIV prevention interventions). Therefore we present results separately according to type of comparison condition.</P>
<P>Behavioral interventions for HIV prevention are frequently categorized by format as small group, individual-level, or community-level interventions. Therefore we present subgroup analyses for each of these categories. Interventions that included both a small group component and an individual-level component were classified as small group interventions. Community-level interventions that included small group or individual-level components were classified as community-level.</P>
<P>We examined differences in effectiveness for small group and individual-level interventions according to characteristics of participants, design, implementation, and intervention content, with statistical control for comparison type (minimal to no HIV prevention in the comparison condition versus standard or other HIV prevention in the comparison condition).</P>
<P>We used a backward stepwise selection process to identify a core set of study characteristics associated with intervention effects among small group and individual-level interventions. We excluded the "random assignment" variable from the selection process because the direction of the effect was counter to the <I>a priori</I> hypothesis that non-randomized trials might yield spuriously strong effects.</P>
<P>Because of the smaller number of community-level studies we did not conduct a multivariable analysis with this group. Because the list of variables associated with effectiveness was different for community-level studies we did not combine them in the multivariable analysis of small group and individual-level studies. For the sake of brevity, we present stratified and multivariable analyses only for rate ratios and not for prevalence ratios.</P>
<P>To investigate the possibility of publication bias, we examined funnel plots of treatment effect by sample size [<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>].</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>As of December 2007, we had identified 44 eligible studies evaluating 58 experimental HIV prevention interventions for MSM [Table of Included Studies]. Primary citations for these studies were found in 21 journals and 1 conference proceeding, with the largest numbers published in AIDS (9), the American Journal of Public Health (5), and the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (4). Two journals (the International Journal of STD and AIDS, and AIDS and Behavior) each published primary citations for 3 studies. Eleven studies tested two or more experimental interventions against comparison conditions, in which case we allocated the control group into equal parts for comparison to each of the interventions as described above. We treat the total of 58 experimental interventions and their paired control conditions as separate units for description and analyses. </P>
<P>Most of the interventions (k [number of interventions] = 40) were compared to minimal or no HIV prevention control conditions. Of these, 18 interventions were delivered in small group format, 11 in individual-level format, and 11 in community-level format. The other 18 interventions (which are marked with an asterisk in the tables and references), including 8 small group interventions and 10 individual-level interventions, were compared to standard or other HIV prevention conditions. </P>
<P>Over two-thirds of the 58 interventions (k = 41) were evaluated in the United States. Also represented were the United Kingdom (k = 5), Australia (k = 4), New Zealand (k = 4), Canada (k = 2), Brazil (k =1) and an international study in Russia and Bulgaria (k=1). The weighted mean age of participants was 33 years (range 21 to 42).</P>
<P>Across all studies, an average of 30% of participants were African American, Latino, Asian, or of other race/ethnic groups besides whites. Only 4 interventions in 3 studies focused on specific racial or ethnic groups: African Americans [<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1996-1s" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1996 1s</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1996-3s" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1996 3s</LINK>], Asians and Pacific Islanders [<LINK REF="STD-Choi-1996_x0040_" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 1996@</LINK>], and Latinos [<LINK REF="STD-Carballo_x002d_Di_x00e9_guez2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carballo-Diéguez2005</LINK>].

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Assignment to treatment condition was random for most (48 of 58) interventions. For 7 interventions, large units such as cities, neighborhoods, or clinics were assigned to treatment condition based on convenience. Assignment was alternated between conditions in 3 other studies.</P>
<P>Among the small group and individual-level interventions, overall retention was high (from 80 to 100%) for 24 interventions and low (38 to 79%) for 21 interventions. Retention rates were not available for 2 studies; these were combined with the high retention rate group for analyses below. Also among the small group and individual-level interventions, 15 studies had greater retention in the comparison condition (mean = 8.5% greater, standard deviation = 7.6%), while 19 studies had greater retention in the intervention condition (mean = 8.4% greater, standard deviation = 9.0%). For analyses of differential retention as a dichotomous variable, 5 studies for which retention was equal in the two conditions were combined with the 15 studies with greater retention in the comparison condition, and 8 studies for which differential retention was not available were combined with the 19 studies with greater retention in the comparison condition.</P>

<P>EFFECTS OF INTERVENTIONS VS. MINIMAL TO NO HIV PREVENTION<BR/>The 40 interventions that were measured against minimal to no HIV prevention intervention reduced the number of episodes of or partners for unprotected sex by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15%, 37%) [Table 01.01]. The total MSM sample size in these 40 interventions was 11,864. The corresponding rate ratio was .73 (CI = .63, .85). This effect represents a decrease from the average background mean of 10.1 unprotected occasions in a 6-month period to 7.4 (CI = 6.4, 8.6), and from 1.2 partners for anal sex without condoms in a 6-month period to 0.9 (CI = 0.8, 1.0). The intervention effects were statistically homogeneous (Q[39 df] = 28.3, p for test of heterogeneity = 0.90).</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses the reduction was 30% (CI = 10%, 45%) among 18 small group interventions, 20% (CI = -6%, 40%) among 11 individual-level interventions, and 30% (CI = 9%, 45%) among 11 community-level interventions. Effects within each intervention format were also quite homogeneous (p = 0.74 for small groups, 0.99 for individual-level, and 0.29 for community-level interventions) indicating that results were statistically consistent among interventions within each format.</P>
<P>The same 40 interventions reduced the proportion of subjects reporting unprotected sex by 23% (CI = 17%, 28%) [Table 01.02]. The corresponding prevalence ratio was .77 (CI = .72, .83). This effect represents a decrease from an average of 41% reporting unprotected sex to 32% (CI = 30%, 34%). In subgroup analyses, significant reductions in the proportion reporting unprotected sex were observed for all three subgroups: a 27% reduction for small group interventions (CI = 16%, 36%), 16% for individual-level interventions (CI = 3%, 26%), and 25% for community-level interventions (CI = 16%, 34%). Again, the effects among studies were consistent both overall (p for heterogeneity = .14) and within subsets (p = .16 for small groups, p = .15 for individual-level, and p = .57 for community-level interventions).</P>
<P>EFFECTS OF INTERVENTIONS VS. STANDARD OR OTHER HIV PREVENTION</P>
<P>The 18 remaining interventions reduced the number of episodes of or partners for unprotected sex by 17% beyond changes observed in standard or other HIV prevention interventions (CI = 5%, 27%) [Table 02.01]. The total MSM sample size in these 18 studies was 6721. The corresponding rate ratio was .83 (CI = .73, .95). In subset analyses, the reductions were 23% (CI = -1%, 41%) among 8 small group interventions and 14% (CI = 0%, 27%) among 10 individual-level interventions. There were no community-level interventions in this subset.</P>
<P>The same 18 interventions reduced the proportion reporting unprotected sex by 7% beyond changes observed in standard or other HIV prevention interventions (CI = 3%, 11%) [Table 02.02]. The corresponding prevalence ratio was .93 (CI = .89, .97). The reduction was 13% among the 8 small group interventions (CI = 3%, 22%), and 6% among the 10 individual-level interventions (CI = 1%, 10%).</P>
<P>STRATIFIED ANALYSES OF RATE RATIOS FOR SMALL GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS</P>
<P>Summary effects for all subgroups were in the favorable direction, but effects were statistically significant for some subgroups and not for others [<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>]. We hypothesized <I>a priori</I> that intervention effects would be strongest in studies with a neutral comparison condition (minimal to no HIV prevention content). Therefore all analyses in this table (except for comparison condition itself) are controlled for type of comparison condition. For each set of stratification variables (participants, design, implementation, and intervention content), we note the stratum of studies that yields the most favorable results in terms of the point estimate of the percentage decrease in risky behavior (1 minus the rate ratio).</P>
<P>Studies performed in the United States yielded a 22% reduction in number of episodes of or partners for unprotected sex that was statistically significant (CI = 12%, 31%) while those performed elsewhere showed a net reduction of 13% that was not statistically significant (CI = -25%, 39%). Summary effects for all other subgroups according to participant characteristics were favorable and statistically significant. The most favorable summary effect by type of participants, a 27% reduction in risky behavior, was observed in studies with younger mean age (21 to 33 years).</P>
<P>All stratifications by characteristics of design resulted in statistically significant favorable results except for two groupings: studies in which assignment was not random, and studies for which a count outcome for unprotected sex was not available (in which case the dichotomous unprotected sex outcome was used instead with transformations as described above). The most favorable summary effect by design features, a 31% reduction in risky behavior, was observed in studies with a shorter intervention delivery time (up to one month).</P>
<P>With respect to characteristics of implementation, all subsets yielded statistically significant effects except for those with a lower background prevalence of unprotected sex. The most favorable effect by implementation features, a 33% reduction in risky behavior, was observed among those studies where retention of participants at followup was better in the intervention condition than in the comparison condition.</P>
<P>Finally, summary effects of interventions including each type of content were statistically significant except for those including technical skills and those including "other" content. The most favorable effect by intervention content, a 38% reduction in risky behavior, was observed among interventions addressing perception of risk and losses ("unsafe sex puts you at risk") rather than gains ("safer sex protects you").</P>
<P>MULTIVARIABLE MODEL OF RATE RATIOS FOR SMALL GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS</P>
<P>A multivariable model of rate ratios for small group and individual-level interventions was selected by a backwards elimination process [<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>]. All variables described in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> were included in the first model, and the variable with the smallest effect was removed. This process was repeated until each of the variables was retained with p&lt;.10. The four variables remaining in the model all pertained to design and implementation. The most favorable reductions in episodes of or partners for unprotected sex among small group and individual-level interventions (33% to 35%) were observed among studies with count outcomes, shorter intervention span (&lt;= 1 month), better retention in the intervention group than in the comparison group, and minimal to no HIV prevention delivered to the comparison condition.</P>
<P>By contrast the least favorable reductions (16% to 19% decreases) were observed among studies with only dichotomous outcomes, those with longer intervention spans, those with approximately equal retention or better retention in the comparison condition, and those where the comparison condition received some intervention relevant to HIV prevention. However the summary effects were still significant even among studies with stronger design and implementation characteristics, specifically, HIV prevention content delivered to the comparison condition and less attrition from the comparison condition.</P>
<P>STRATIFIED ANALYSES OF RATE RATIOS FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS</P>
<P>We also examined differences in effectiveness for community-level interventions according to characteristics of participants, design, implementation, and intervention content [<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>]. The comparison type for all community-level interventions was minimal to no HIV prevention, so statistical control for comparison type was not necessary in this subgroup.</P>
<P>Summary effects for all subgroups of community-level interventions were favorable, but effects were statistically significant for some subgroups and not for others. With regard to characteristics of participants, the greatest reductions in unprotected sex (reductions of 40% or more) were observed among studies with more than 25% non-gay identified men and those whose samples were at least 90% white. Significant reductions were also observed among studies conducted in the US; those with mean age of 31 or older; and those with 7% or more HIV-positive men.</P>
<P>In terms of design and implementation, significant reductions of 40% or more were observed among community-level interventions with random allocation, shorter recall periods, and longer followup times. Significant summary effects were also seen among studies with shorter intervention spans, count outcomes, those conducted before 1995, those with serial cross-sectional designs, and those with a lower background prevalence of unprotected sex showed significant summary results. Summary effects in other strata of design and implementation were not significant.</P>
<P>In terms of intervention content, a significant 40% reduction in unprotected sex was observed among studies that addressed personal skills. Significant reductions were also seen among studies that addressed gains, risk perception, and interpersonal skills. Favorable but non-significant reductions were observed among studies that addressed information and technical skills.</P>
<P>Because there were only 11 community-level interventions studies, we did not search for a multivariable model for this subset.</P>
<P>PUBLICATION BIAS</P>
<P>Meta-analysis may be vulnerable to publication bias if studies with less favorable results are not found and included. A useful test for publication bias is based on the funnel plot, which compares intervention effects to weights, standard errors, or sample sizes [<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>]. The typical thumbprint of publication bias is the presence of more favorable effects among small studies than among large studies. If increasing weights are plotted on the vertical axis and increasing ratios (RR or PR more favorable to the comparison condition) on the horizontal axis as in funnel plots 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2, the bottom right portion of the figure (representing small studies with less favorable results) will contain fewer studies than the bottom left (representing small studies with more favorable results).</P>
<P>Funnel plots for interventions compared to minimal or no HIV prevention do not appear to indicate publication bias because the population of studies on the right side (indicating weaker effects) of the summary effect is at least as dense as on the left side (indicating stronger effects) [ <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>].</P>
<P>However in the case of interventions compared to standard or other HIV prevention, there may be somewhat fewer studies on the right side of the summary effect than on the left side [ <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>]. If this difference is due to publication bias, estimates from meta-analysis may tend to overstate effects for interventions compared to standard or other HIV prevention.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In randomized controlled trials and non-randomized trials with independent control conditions as described above, behavioral interventions for MSM reduced unprotected anal sex by 27% compared to minimal or no intervention, and reduced the proportion of men reporting any unprotected anal sex by 23%. When compared to standard or other HIV prevention, experimental interventions reduced number of episodes of or partners for unprotected anal sex by 17% and proportion reporting any unprotected anal sex by 7%. These effects were also evident in subgroup analyses of small group and community-level interventions, and somewhat less so for individual-level interventions.</P>
<P>The four characteristics most closely associated with effectiveness of small group and individual-level interventions in multivariable models warrant particular mention. As expected, effects were not as strong when interventions were contrasted against control conditions that included some content related to HIV prevention. Statistical significance results from the interplay of sample size, the strength of the intervention, and the strength of the comparison condition. When designing new studies, researchers should not underestimate the potential impact of active control conditions on behavior. Control for demand (e.g., changing behavior because that is what participants think is expected of them) and control for attention (e.g., changing behavior because participants are engaged in other activities or feel cared about during a research process) are important issues that should be considered when examining the marginal cost of delivering HIV prevention content. Studies in which the comparison condition receives some intervention relevant to HIV prevention will require larger sample sizes. But if they are successful, they will lead to greater confidence that the intervention is effective beyond attention and demand characteristics of the comparison condition.</P>
<P>Because studies with count outcomes showed the most favorable results, researchers and front-line prevention workers should be aware that some risk reduction comes in the form of fewer occasions of or partners for unprotected sex, even among those who do not completely eliminate their risk. A reduction in number of occasions of unprotected sex may have an important impact on HIV transmission rates, particularly if the number of partners for unprotected sex and the density of unprotected sexual networks also decrease.</P>
<P>The fact that the most favorable results were observed among studies with a shorter intervention span suggests that a clear and focused risk reduction message may be most effective, at least for MSM represented in these studies. Finally, effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with greater attrition in the comparison condition than in the intervention condition. Therefore, differential retention may be a threat to validity in these studies, so extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.</P>
<P>Among community-level interventions, rate ratios of .60 or less, indicating a 40% or greater reduction in unprotected sex, were observed in studies with random assignment, shorter recall periods and longer follow-up times, those with more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM, those with more than 90% white participants, and interventions addressing development of personal skills. </P>
<P>We considered non-random assignment a potential threat to validity. If intervention effects had been stronger among studies with non-random assignment, their results could have been considered biased and a good argument could be raised for their exclusion from these meta-analyses. However intervention effects were actually stronger (although not statistically significantly so) in studies with random assignment. This result offers reassurance that inclusion of non-randomized trials (which still had to include baseline data for each condition and no evident source of bias in assignment) in this meta-analysis did not introduce a bias toward favorable effects.</P>
<P>It is encouraging to see effectiveness among community-level studies with longer follow-up times (6-16 months). Shorter recall periods may facilitate better recall and may improve chances of detecting an intervention effect. But in combination with a longer follow-up time, a short recall period implies an extended interim period for which no data are available. This problem can be addressed by collecting multiple waves of follow-up data.</P>
<P>The greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms readily available, avoiding excess intoxicants, self-reinforcement for behavior change, and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of interventions for MSM. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men are no less responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts.</P>
<P>The finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent. An adaptation of the <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1991</LINK>Popular Opinion Leader Model has recently shown success with young African American MSM in a nonrandomized trial in North Carolina [<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2008</LINK>].</P>
<P>Information on biologic outcomes was too limited to warrant quantitative analysis. In one study, a small group intervention for STD clinic patients showed modest reductions in unprotected sex but also resulted in more STD infections than a standard 1-on-1 counseling session about sexual risk behavior [<LINK REF="STD-Imrie-2001_x002a__x0040_" TYPE="STUDY">Imrie 2001*@</LINK>]. However an enhanced individual-level intervention with a similarly modest reduction in unprotected sex was accompanied by a substantial reduction in new HIV infections [<LINK REF="STD-Explore-2004_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Explore 2004*</LINK>]. A third study of a small group intervention for HIV-positive MSM found (nonsignificantly) fewer non-viral STDs in the enhanced intervention than in the standard intervention at followup, but baseline differences made the results difficult to interpret [<LINK REF="STD-Wolitski-2005_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wolitski 2005*</LINK>]. Many more trials are needed to measure the effects of behavioral interventions on HIV and STD incidence.</P>
<P>Some populations at high risk, particularly African-American [<LINK REF="REF-Leone-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leone 2004</LINK>] and Latino MSM, and MSM in countries where English is not the primary language, have been underrepresented in intervention research. Factors affecting HIV risk are likely to differ among such populations [<LINK REF="REF-Courtenay_x002d_Quirk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtenay-Quirk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zea-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zea 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Millett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millett 2004</LINK>]. Use of alcohol and drugs, particularly methamphetamine, and attending bathhouses, sex clubs, and circuit parties may be associated with risky sex among MSM [<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2003-drug" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2003 drug</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crosby-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosby 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semple-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semple 2003</LINK>]. A wide range of effective interventions specifically designed for those at highest risk is urgently needed.</P>
<P>We chose unprotected anal sex as the outcome for these analyses because it is clearly identified as a risk factor for HIV transmission and it was available for all studies. But for better or worse, MSM are also using other behavioral strategies in an effort to reduce risk. Empirical examination of the effects of serosorting, negotiated safety, withdrawal before ejaculation, strategic positioning, and partner selection on HIV transmission is urgently needed [<LINK REF="REF-Hoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoff 2004</LINK>]. Perception of partner's serostatus may be incorrect, so the effectiveness of such strategies in avoiding HIV infection is unknown. Availability of new treatments may contribute to complacency about HIV prevention [<LINK REF="REF-Demmer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demmer 2003</LINK>]. In recent years the internet has become an important factor in the HIV epidemic [<LINK REF="REF-AIDS-Alert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIDS Alert 2004</LINK>], but it may also be useful in prevention [<LINK REF="REF-AIDS-Alert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIDS Alert 2003</LINK>] and in partner notification [<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>]. These relatively new factors that may influence behaviors should be considered in future research.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Meta-analysis provides a comprehensive view of results of studies conducted to date. First, we conclude that behavioral HIV prevention interventions for MSM reduce self-reported unprotected sex and they should be funded. </P>
<P>The intervention content item associated with the greatest effectiveness among small group and individual-level interventions was a focus on losses rather than gains. It may be important in some settings not to shy away from discussion of losses associated with risky sexual behavior and HIV infection.</P>
<P>The intervention content item associated with the greatest effectiveness among community-level interventions was personal skills such as keeping condoms readily available, avoiding excess intoxicants, self-reinforcement for behavior change, and behavioral self-management. Intervention curricula should address these skills, and staff should be trained in their delivery. Community-level interventions may also benefit from longer follow-up times.</P>
<P>The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Even though their initial level of risk behavior tends to be lower than that of gay-identified men, non-gay identified MSM may have less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of target populations, sample size, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.</P>
<P>First and foremost, there is a critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.</P>
<P>When effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Given results from the multivariable model above, researchers designing new studies to measure intervention effects should strongly consider measuring unprotected sex as count outcomes including both the number of partners for unprotected sex and the number of occasions of unprotected sex. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should also keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).</P>
<P>Among small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. However statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.</P>
<P>When effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.</P>
<P>While community-level interventions may require longer follow-up times, measurement of their effects also benefits from shorter recall periods, which may necessitate multiple waves of data collection. Also among community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. </P>
<P>Further research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African-American and Hispanic MSM and MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.</P>

RESULTS: Slippage with removal was reported more frequently with Reality than male latex condoms [odds ratio (OR), 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-5.8 for receptive partners and OR, 34.1; 95% CI, 13.8-84.1 for insertive partners]. Receptive partners more frequently reported pain or discomfort (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.6-9.4) and rectal bleeding (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9-4.1) with Reality condoms than male condoms. Over 20% reported willingness to use the Reality condom in the future with a partner of unknown HIV status; willingness was associated with past problems with male condoms and no problems with Reality condoms among receptive partners, and with past use of Reality condoms and HIV seropositivity among insertive partners. CONCLUSIONS: Men reported more frequent problems with Reality condoms than male latex condoms used for anal intercourse, particularly slippage, discomfort, and rectal bleeding. Design modifications, training, and research on the clinical significance of safety outcomes are needed for use of Reality condoms with anal sex.&lt;/p&gt;" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
