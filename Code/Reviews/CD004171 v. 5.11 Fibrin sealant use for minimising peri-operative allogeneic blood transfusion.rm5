<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-22 02:02:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fibrin sealants are composed of specific blood clotting agents that, when applied to wound surfaces, help stop bleeding. In liquid form, fibrin sealants are generally sprayed directly onto wound surfaces. They are often used to try to reduce blood loss during and after surgery and therefore avoid blood transfusions. Although fibrin sealant components are derived from blood products, they have a lower risk of transmitting infections than donor blood. The review of trials found that fibrin sealants can reduce surgical blood loss and the need for blood transfusion. Fibrin sealants appear to be most effective when used in orthopaedic surgery.</P>

<P>Fibrin sealants (also referred to as biological glue or fibrin tissue adhesives) have gained increasing popularity as interventions to improve peri-operative (intra- and post-operative) haemostasis and diminish the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion (blood from an unrelated donor).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the efficacy of fibrin sealants in reducing peri-operative blood loss and allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-05-09 10:52:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified studies by searching CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008), manufacturer web sites (to March 2008), and bibliographies of relevant published articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-09 10:53:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Controlled trials in which adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment or to a control group which did not receive fibrin sealant treatment. Trials were eligible if they reported data on the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red cell transfusion, the volume of blood transfused, or blood loss (assessed objectively).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-09 10:55:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcomes measured were the: number of patients exposed to allogeneic red cells, amount of blood transfused, and blood loss. Other outcomes measured were: re-operation due to bleeding, infection, mortality, thrombotic events, and length of hospital stay. Treatment effects were pooled using a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-09 11:04:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen trials that included a total of 1406 patients reported data on peri-operative exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion. Fibrin sealant treatment, on average, reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 37% (relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.88) and 7% in absolute terms (95% CI 2% to 13%). Fourteen trials, including a total of 853 patients, provided data for post-operative blood loss. In aggregate, fibrin sealant treatment reduced blood loss on average by around 161 ml per patient (95% CI 98.25 to 224.53 ml). In the context of orthopaedic surgery, fibrin sealant treatment reduced post-operative blood loss on average by around 223 ml per patient (95% CI 119.85 to 325.18 ml) and reduced the risk of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89). Fibrin sealant treatment was not associated with an increased risk of wound infection (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.58), any infection (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.94), haematoma formation (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.18), or death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.89). Hospital length of stay was not reduced in patients treated with fibrin sealant (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.21 days, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.01 days).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-09 11:09:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the results suggest that fibrin sealants are efficacious in reducing both post-operative blood loss and peri-operative exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion. Although treatment-effect heterogeneity was observed for these primary efficacy outcomes, heterogeneity was generally in terms of the size of effect rather than the direction of effect. Fibrin sealants appeared to demonstrate their greatest beneficial effects in the context of orthopaedic surgery, where blood loss is often substantial. Trials not involving orthopaedic surgery generally showed a trend toward decreased post-operative blood loss but the observed reductions were not clinically significant. The majority of trials included in this review were small, which raises concerns about the potential effects of publication bias. Funnel plot assessment indicates that there is some evidence of publication bias in the form of a missing population of small negative trials. We believe that large, methodologically rigorous, randomised controlled trials of fibrin sealants are needed.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-09 11:43:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Red blood cell transfusions are an extremely common medical intervention. Of all red blood cell units transfused, between 60% and 70% are used in the surgical setting (<LINK REF="REF-Hasley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1997</LINK>). Worldwide concern regarding the safety of transfused blood has prompted a reconsideration of the role of allogeneic blood transfusion (whole blood or packed red cells from an unrelated donor). Although allogeneic blood transfusion has had a unique place in medical practice, the evidence on the benefits, harms, and costs of a range of techniques designed to minimise the use of this scarce resource needs to be critically examined. Some of the alternatives to allogeneic blood transfusion have their own risks and are expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The International Study of Peri-operative Transfusion (ISPOT) (a 10-country study of evidence, attitudes, and practices relating to the use of alternatives to peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion) generated a number of systematic reviews that examined the efficacy and safety of various technologies employed to minimise the need for peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forgie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1998</LINK>). Amongst the various technologies studied were the anti-fibrinolytic drugs, aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon aminocaproic acid; desmopressin (deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin or DDAVP); autologous blood donation by pre-operative deposit (PAD); acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH); and cell salvage (CS). Findings from these studies indicate that PAD, ANH, and CS (techniques for re-infusing a patient's own blood and not for reducing blood loss) are associated with relatively small benefits in terms of reducing the need for allogeneic blood. However, the use of those technologies intended to reduce surgical blood loss, such as with aprotinin and tranexamic acid, are associated with significant benefits in terms of reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fibrin sealants are a technology intended to reduce surgical blood loss. They have been used in surgery for more than 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Martinowitz-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinowitz 1996a</LINK>) and many surgeons have advocated that they are the material that best approaches the ideal operative sealant (<LINK REF="REF-Gibble-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibble 1990</LINK>). Recognition of their potential as haemostatic agents has seen their use expand across a range of surgical settings, including cardiovascular, orthopaedic, thoracic, and orthodontic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sierra-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sierra 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a biological agent, fibrin has been used since the turn of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. As early as 1909, Bergel (<LINK REF="REF-Bergel-1909" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergel 1909</LINK>) reported the use of dried plasma as a source of fibrinogen and fibrin fleece to establish surgical haemostasis. The first use of plasma fibrinogen mixed with bovine thrombin was reported in 1944 (<LINK REF="REF-Cronkite-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronkite 1944</LINK>). The mixing of bovine thrombin with physiological fibrinogen (2 to 5 mg/ml) as a means of accelerating the formation of the fibrin clot was also reported by Tidrick and Warner (<LINK REF="REF-Tidrick-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tidrick 1944</LINK>). After these early studies enthusiasm for fibrin sealants subsided, due in part to the suboptimal adhesive properties and inadequate strength of the sealants used (<LINK REF="REF-Matras-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matras 1985</LINK>). The lack of a concentrated source of fibrinogen was cited by Matras (<LINK REF="REF-Matras-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matras 1985</LINK>) as the reason for the suboptimal adhesive properties of the early sealants. Early studies were also mainly limited to the direct application of dry fibrin or fibrin tampons to bleeding surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>With improvements in plasma fractionation methods and the availability of concentrated fibrinogen, significant progress was made in improving the rheological properties (elasticity, tensile strength, adhesiveness) of fibrin sealants (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>). During the late 1970s the first commercial, multi-donor, fibrin sealant products were made available throughout Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Gibble-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibble 1990</LINK>). However, as the first commercial fibrin sealants relied on a consistent and concentrated source of human fibrinogen, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States revoked the licence for the clinical use of pooled commercial fibrinogen concentrates due to the high risk of hepatitis transmission with the fibrinogen (<LINK REF="REF-Gibble-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibble 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to resolve this issue, most commercial products adopted various viral inactivation procedures including pasteurisation (60 °C for 10 hours, liquid state), solvent-detergent treatment, steam treatment (60 °C for 30 hours, dry state), ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, nanofiltration (35 nm), and dry heat treatment (100 °C for 30 minutes). Although some of these procedures are effective against lipid-enveloped viruses, not all inactivate non-enveloped viruses present in human plasma, such as parvovirus B19 and hepatitis A virus (HAV). UVC irradiation in the presence of rutin (a free radical scavenger added to protect plasma protein biological activity) has been shown to be effective against such viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>). Experimental studies in mice have shown nanofiltration (using a 35 nm pore size filter membrane) to be effective in removing the Creutzfeld-Jakob agent from infected brain extracts and, therefore, this technique may be of benefit in reducing the risks of prion disease transmission via fibrin sealants in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Tateishi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tateishi 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the risks of viral transmission from fibrin sealants prepared from pooled human plasma are considered to be low, there has been a concerted effort to develop fibrin sealant systems that utilise autologous fibrinogen as opposed to fibrinogen obtained from single or random donor pooled plasma. However, a 'zero' risk cannot be guaranteed, even with the use of autologous fibrinogen, as microbial and viral contamination from operators, equipment, or both, may occur during the processing phase (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, a number of commercial and 'home-made' (blood bank prepared) sealants are used throughout the world. Although the composition of the components and the methods of preparation vary considerably in each of the commercial and 'home-made' products their primary components remain similar.</P>
<P>Fibrin sealants generally contain two major components. These are fibrinogen (with or without factor XIII) and thrombin (plus calcium, usually in the form of calcium chloride). Fibrinogen, the main structural component in fibrin sealants, is a protein produced primarily by liver hepatocytes and secondarily by platelets that circulates in plasma at a concentration of 2 to 5 mg/ml. Thrombin is a serine protease that is generated from an inactive form (prothrombin) by the enzyme prothrombinase in the presence of calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Sierra-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sierra 1993</LINK>). During the final phase of the coagulation cascade, thrombin in the presence of calcium converts fibrinogen to insoluble, loose fibrin threads. Fibrin sealants facilitate haemostasis by mimicking this final phase of the coagulation cascade which leads to the formation of a semi-rigid clot (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>). The components of fibrin sealants are commonly applied to the wound surface simultaneously using single- or dual-syringe systems that deliver the sealant in a liquid or aerosolised form. The dual-syringe system is designed in such a way that the sealant components are mixed passively while exiting the syringe, just prior to wound contact. To provide a fine, more uniform film of sealant on the wound surface, spray devices that aerosolise the sealant using small, portable gas propellant systems are frequently used. Whereas liquid application using fine needle delivery systems is more suitable for small wound surfaces, fibrin sealants delivered using spray devices are more appropriate for diffuse, slow bleeding and large body surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Radosevich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radosevich 1997</LINK>).</P>

The specific text-word terms included: fibrin glue$, fibrin sealant$, fibrin seal$, biological glue$ or biological seal$, beriplast, bolheal, tissucol, tisseel, quixil, biocol, cryoseal.</P>
<P>To restrict and improve the specificity of these searches, two search filters were used. Firstly, a filter developed by the ISPOT (International Study of Peri-operative Transfusion) group (<A HREF="laupacis%201997">Laupacis 1997</A>) which identifies blood transfusion trials using the MeSH terms: 'blood transfusion', 'hemorrhage', and 'anesthesia'; the ISPOT filter combines these MeSH terms with the text-word terms: transfusion$, bleed$, blood loss$, hemorrhag$. Secondly, an RCT filter (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>) was used to identify randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>These search filters were combined with the specified MeSH terms and the relevant text-word terms for fibrin sealant.<BR/>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-05-09 12:25:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Articles were assessed for methodologic quality by two of the authors (PAC, DMA) using criteria proposed by Schulz et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). These criteria involve four items of assessment: double-blinding, allocation concealment, participant exclusion (withdrawal post-randomisation), and the methods used to achieve randomisation. In the case of double-blinding, allocation concealment, and participant exclusion, three numeric values (0, 1, 2) were allocated to each of the three scales within each of these items. For example, trials judged to have adequately concealed treatment allocation scored 2, whereas trials judged not to have concealed treatment allocation scored 0. In the case of the method used to achieve randomisation, two numeric values (0, 1) were allocated to each of the two scales within this item of assessment. Therefore, trials scored 1 if the method used to generate allocation sequences was judged to have been adequate (for example random number table, computer random number generator), whereas inadequate or unreported methods scored 0.</P>
<P>Inter-rater agreement for each item of methodological quality assessment was assessed by comparing the observed or achieved agreement (the proportion of studies for which the two raters assigned the same score) with that expected by chance (the agreement that would be achieved if the raters assigned scores at random). STATA® statistical software was used to calculate agreement and kappa statistics (&#954;). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of included trials was also assessed with particular emphasis on allocation concealment, which was ranked as follows.</P>

<P>We analysed dichotomous data (for example number of patients transfused, infection, thrombosis, patients requiring re-operation for bleeding) and continuous data (for example mean units of blood transfused, and mean volume of blood loss) using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5</LINK>). If standard deviations (SD) or standard error of means (SEM) were not reported for continuous data (or could not be calculated from raw data or summary estimates) we did not include the study in the meta-analysis. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as pooled relative risks (RR) or risk differences (RD) and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous variables using a random-effects model.

We used a P value less than or equal to 0.1 to define statistically significant heterogeneity. The I² statistic was used to quantify inconsistency across trials.

<P>Of the 26 included trials, 77% (n = 20) recruited less than 50 patients in each arm. The trials were conducted in a range of countries: United States (n = 6), Germany (n = 3), Denmark (n = 3), Japan (n = 3), France (n = 2), United Kingdom (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), Taiwan (Republic of China) (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1), India (n = 1), Ireland (n = 1), and Israel (n = 1). The majority of trials were published in English (88.5%). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gasser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecsey-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Vecsey 1980</LINK>) were published in German and one was published in French (<LINK REF="STD-Wurtz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtz 1991</LINK>). These studies were translated before being included in the analysis.</P>
<P>The trials were heterogeneous in terms of surgical setting and nature of the intervention (type of fibrin sealant and method of application). Trials were conducted across a range of surgical settings including orthopaedic surgery (n = 7), liver surgery (n = 5), vascular surgery (n = 4), prostate surgery (n = 3), thoracic surgery (n = 3), renal surgery (n = 1), pancreatic surgery (n = 1), cardiac surgery (n = 1), and plastic surgery (incisional hernia repair with dermolipectomy) (n = 1).</P>
<P>There was also considerable variation in the type of fibrin sealant studied. Five trials investigated Tissucol®/Tisseel® (Immuno AG, Vienna, Austria), three studied Beriplast® P (Beringwerke/Centeon, Marburg, Germany; FSBP, Aventis Behring, Strasbourg, France), five studied Omrixil®/Quixil® (Omrix Biopharmaceuticals SA, Israel and Belgium; Johnson &amp; Johnson Wound Management, Somerville, New Jersey), two studied Biocol® (LFB, Les Ulis, France), three investigated an autologous fibrin sealant produced by the Vivostat® system (Conva Tec, Bristol-Meyers Squibb; Vivolution A/S, Denmark), two trials studied Hemaseel APR (Hemacure Corporation, Sarasota, FL, USA; Baxter Health Care Corporation, CA, USA), one studied a fibrin sealant produced by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and the Central Regional de Transfusion Sanguine (CRTS, Lille, France), one trial investigated an autologous fibrin sealant produced by the CryoSeal® FS system (ThermoGenesis Corporation, CA, USA), one trial studied a fibrin sealant produced by the Baxter Healthcare Group (Hyland Division, USA) and the American Red Cross, and one trial studied an autologous fibrin sealant.<BR/>
<BR/>The trials conducted by Vecsey (<LINK REF="STD-Vecsey-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Vecsey 1980</LINK>) and Gasser et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gasser 1983</LINK>) used fibrin sealant components obtained from various manufacturers. The cryoprecipitate-fibrinogen was obtained from Immuno AG, Wien, and the thrombin solution (Topostatin®) was obtained from Hoffman-La Roche, Basel. Both these trials used collagen fleece as a carrier for the fibrin sealant. The trial conducted by Gasser et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gasser 1983</LINK>) used collagen fleece obtained from Disperga, Wien, and the trial conducted by Vecsey (<LINK REF="STD-Vecsey-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Vecsey 1980</LINK>) used collagen fleece obtained from Pentapharm AG, Basel. These two trials used 150 cm<SUP>2</SUP> of collagen fleece to contain the fibrin sealant. The factor XIII concentrate used by Gasser et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Gasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gasser 1983</LINK>) was obtained from Behringwerke, Hamburg. Both trials used the anti-fibrinolytic agents aprotinin (Trasylol®) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (Episkapron®) as clot stabilising agents.</P>
<P>Each of the different types of fibrin sealant studied varied in composition. The fibrinogen content ranged from 29 to 115 mg/ml, whereas the thrombin concentration ranged from 200 to 1000 IU/ml (international units per millilitre). In the case of the fibrin sealant produced by the CryoSeal® FS system, studies by Buchta<I> </I>et al<I> </I>and Rock et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Buchta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rock 2003</LINK>) indicated that the fibrinogen content of this product is around 22 ± 7 mg/ml and the thrombin content is around 38 to 46 U/ml. The autologous fibrin glue used by Mawatari et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Mawatari-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mawatari 2006</LINK>) contained around 249 ± 23 mg/ml of fibrinogen. In this study the auto-Cryo containing fibrinogen and other coagulation factors (Solution A) was mixed intra-operatively with Solution B which contained thrombin (5000 IU), 5 ml of 2% calcium chloride, and aprotinin (50,000 IU). The use of anti-fibrinolytic agents also varied with the different agents studied. The aprotinin content ranged from 1000 to 10,000 KIU/ml (kallikrein inhibitor units per millilitre). The fibrin sealant Quixil&#8482; contained 95 mg/ml of tranexamic acid (TXA) as the anti-fibrinolytic agent. Where studies failed to provide product details we contacted authors and used manufacturer web sites to source information pertaining to the fibrin sealant components.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of trial methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The aggregate quality scores (maximum score of 7) were particularly low, with the majority of trials (82%) scoring less than or equal to 3 out of 7. This indicates that the overall methodological quality of the 22 assessed trials was poor. In summary, full blinding of outcomes assessment did not occur in any study, although partial blinding (single-blinding) was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kjaergard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaergard 1998</LINK>). In three trials, patients were either blind to treatment assignment or the outcomes were assessed by an individual blind to the allocated patient treatment schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Belboul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belboul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fabian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of trials (68%) failed to report the method used to generate allocation sequences (the randomisation process). Of the seven trials that described the method used to generate the allocation sequence, one reported using central randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1999</LINK>), four reported using computer-generated random sequences (<LINK REF="STD-Belboul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belboul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lillemoe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lillemoe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mawatari-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mawatari 2006</LINK>), and two reported using randomisation codes placed in sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1992</LINK>). The latter method has the potential to be unmasked, leading to the potential for selection bias in the inclusion of patients to the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Follow up appears to have been complete in all but five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kjaergard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaergard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noun-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Noun 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>) which reported a small number of exclusions, so differential withdrawal is an unlikely source of bias.</P>

However, it should be noted that one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gasser 1983</LINK>) within this subgroup provided 95.2% of the information (weight). In the case of orthopaedic surgery (n = 7 trials), the use of fibrin sealant significantly reduced the rate of allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89) compared to control (heterogeneity P = 0.45; I² = 0%).</P>

There were five trials that investigated the fibrin sealant Quixil®. These trials included a total of 312 patients of whom 152 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. Four of these five trials involved orthopaedic surgery. The use of Quixil® significantly reduced the rate of allogeneic red cell transfusion by a relative 41% (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84).

<P>Eight trials reported data for the amount of blood transfused. These trials included a total of 685 patients of whom 332 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. Overall, the use of fibrin sealant reduced the amount of red blood cells transfused on average by around 0.27 units per patient (95% CI 0.01 to 0.54 units).

<P>Fourteen trials provided post-operative blood loss data. These trials included a total of 853 patients of whom 425 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. On average, fibrin sealant use statistically significantly reduced the volume of post-operative blood loss by around 161 ml per patient (95% CI 98 to 225 ml).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Post-operative blood loss - type of surgery</HEADING>
<P>The greatest reductions in post-operative blood loss were observed in the seven trials that were conducted in the setting of orthopaedic surgery. These trials included a total of 482 patients of whom 235 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. When used in orthopaedic surgery, the use of fibrin sealant reduced blood loss by around 223 ml per patient (WMD -222.52 ml, 95% CI -325.18 to -119.85 ml). However, heterogeneity in treatment effect was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001; I² = 78%). For the two trials that were conducted in the setting of liver surgery, the use of fibrin sealant on average did not statistically significantly reduce the volume of post-operative blood loss (WMD -107.90 ml, 95% CI -370.68 to 154.88 ml). For the three trials that involved prostate surgery, the use of fibrin sealant was associated with a reduction in post-operative blood loss of around 70 ml per patient (WMD -70.25 ml, 95% CI -136.59 to -3.90 ml). Although this result is statistically significant, such small reductions in blood loss do not translate into clinically meaningful reductions. There were two trials that involved thoracic surgery. These trials included a total of 90 patients of whom 45 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. The use of fibrin sealant in this surgical context did not statistically significantly reduce the volume of post-operative blood loss (WMD -161.99 ml, 95% CI -586.20 to 262.21 ml).</P>
<P>Although the trial conducted by Kjaergard et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Kjaergard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaergard 1998</LINK>) reported that operative blood loss was lower in the group randomised to fibrin sealant (mean = 887 ml, median = 720 ml, range 420 to 1765 ml) than in the control group (mean = 1089 ml, median = 733 ml, range 200 to 3200 ml) the difference was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.4). The trial conducted by Sintler et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Sintler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sintler 2005</LINK>) reported a statistically significant reduction in blood loss in the fibrin sealant group compared to the control group following carotid clamp release. The median blood loss in the Quixil® fibrin sealant group was 24.5 ml (range 5.5 to 105.0 ml) compared to 203 ml (range 54.5 to 817.0 ml) in the Kaltostat® control group (P &lt; 0.001). The trial conducted by Taylor et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2003</LINK>) reported lower blood loss in the fibrin sealant group compared to the control group treated with thrombin soaked gauze (TSG) in patients undergoing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) femoral artery grafts. In patients treated with Beriplast® fibrin sealant the median blood loss was 3.81 ml (± 28.27 ml) compared to 14.8 ml (± 27.03 ml) (P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the trial conducted by Fabian et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Fabian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fabian 2003</LINK>) reported a mean blood loss of 440 ml in those patients treated with Hemaseel® fibrin sealant compared to 485 ml in those patients randomised to the control group (P = 0.362).</P>
<P>It should be noted that these trials were not included in the meta-analysis of blood loss due to the lack of usable data (means and SDs or SEMs were not reported).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intra-operative blood loss</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials including a total of 463 patients reported data for intra-operative blood loss. The use of fibrin sealant did not statistically significantly impact on intra-operative blood loss (WMD -4.51 ml, 95% CI -36.86 to 27.83 ml). For four of the seven trials, the fibrin sealant was not applied to the wound surface until at the end of the operative procedure, just prior to wound closure. As most of the intra-operative blood loss would have occurred prior to fibrin sealant application, the small difference in intra-operative blood loss between groups may well be expected. Any significant reductions in intra-operative blood loss may not necessarily reflect the efficacy of fibrin sealant treatment but rather reflect better surgical techniques or a greater propensity for some patients to achieve haemostasis in the face of physiological insult. The latter is greatly influenced by a patient's pre-operative exposure to antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy, or both. In the case of the trial conducted by Lillemoe et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lillemoe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lillemoe 2004</LINK>) greater blood loss was observed in fibrin sealant treated patients (800 ml) compared to the control group (650 ml).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intra-operative blood loss - type of surgery</HEADING>
<P>Of the seven trials that reported data for intra-operative blood loss three involved liver surgery. These trials included a total of 166 patients of whom 76 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. For these trials, fibrin sealant use did not statistically significantly reduce intra-operative blood loss (WMD -124.92 ml, 95% CI -545.32 to 295.49 ml). In the case of the three trials involving orthopaedic surgery, intra-operative blood loss was not statistically significantly reduced in those patients treated with fibrin sealant compared to control (WMD -8.48 ml, 95% CI -45.79 to 28.84 ml). For the trial that involved vascular surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1999</LINK>), fibrin sealant use did not statistically significantly reduce intra-operative blood loss (P = 0.551).</P>
<P>Although the trial conducted by Milne et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Milne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1995</LINK>) reported that operative blood loss was lower in the group randomised to fibrin sealant (median = 420 ml, range 300 to 500 ml) than in the control group (median = 550 ml, range 350 to 1200 ml) the difference was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this trial was not included in the meta-analysis of blood loss due to the lack of usable data (means and SDs or SEMs were not reported).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Total blood loss - intra-operative and post-operative blood loss combined</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported data for total blood loss (intra- and post-operative). These trials included a total of 502 patients of whom 248 were randomised to fibrin sealant treatment. In aggregate, the use of fibrin sealant significantly reduced the amount of total blood loss compared to control (WMD -216.18 ml, 95% CI -406.26 to -26.10 ml). When data for the three orthopaedic trials were analysed separately, the amount of total blood loss was reduced on average by around 272 ml in those patients treated with fibrin sealant compared to control (WMD -271.99 ml, 95% CI 93.63 to 450.35 ml).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Ten trials including a total of 1014 patients reported mortality data. Fibrin sealant use did not statistically significantly impact on the rates of mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.89). There were 11 reported deaths in fibrin sealant treated patients (11/501; 2.2%) compared to 13 deaths in control group patients (13/513; 2.5%). Four of these trials reported that no deaths occurred during the trial period. It should be noted that the majority of deaths (62.5%) occurred in just two trials, both involving liver surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Figueras-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Figueras 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1992</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 13:04:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The results indicate that fibrin sealant use resulted in an average reduction in post-operative blood loss of around 161 ml per patient. Further, the use of fibrin sealants reduced exposure to allogeneic red cell transfusion on average by a relative 37%; 7% in absolute terms. It is notable that for those trials that provided data for the number of patients transfused allogeneic red blood cells (RBC), there appeared to be very little correlation between blood loss and the rates of transfusion. Although patients treated with fibrin sealant were transfused far less frequently than controls (15.3% versus 21.8%), the differences in mean post-operative blood loss for these trials were quite small. The trial conducted by Levy et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1999</LINK>) was the only study where the reduction in mean post-operative blood loss was both clinically and statistically significant (mean difference = 705 ml, 95% CI 420.74 to 989.26 ml; P &lt; 0.001). For this trial, 17% of the patients in the fibrin sealant group were exposed to allogeneic RBC compared to 55% in the control group. For the remaining trials the mean differences in post-operative blood loss ranged from just 23 ml to 358 ml, with blood transfusion exposure rates for the fibrin sealant groups ranging from 0% to 48.5% and the control groups ranging from 0% to 61%.</P>
<P>A number of factors may account for this apparent lack of correlation between blood loss and the frequency of blood transfusion. Firstly, blood loss may not have been measured or estimated accurately; blood extravasation (bleeding into surrounding tissues) cannot be evacuated by drainage systems and therefore cannot be measured directly (inapparent blood loss) although it can be estimated using various formulae (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1989</LINK>). Secondly, the decision to transfuse RBC was based on haemodynamic variables rather than blood loss. Thirdly, the decision to transfuse RBC was based on haematological variables (that is haemoglobin or haematocrit levels) or arbitrary transfusion thresholds rather than blood loss. Fourthly, in the absence of transfusion protocols, blood transfusion practice may have been somewhat haphazard. Fifthly, a disproportionate number of patients may have been donors and recipients of autologous blood; and finally, as the majority of studies were unblinded, knowledge of the patient's treatment schedule may have reversed a transfusion decision even when there was no clear clinical need.</P>
<P>It appears that in some cases the decision to transfuse may not have been based on clear clinical need, and the transfused volume may have been small. As the decision to transfuse (the primary outcome in this meta-analysis) is a practice variable rather than a clinical variable, it involves a degree of subjectivity. This raises questions about the validity of blood transfusion exposure as an outcome variable in unblinded trials. Blinding surgeons to the application of a topical haemostatic agent, where no suitable placebo is available, is difficult and therefore it is quite possible that those patients allocated to receive fibrin sealant treatment may have been transfused more conservatively during the peri-operative period. As only four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Figueras-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Figueras 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjaergard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaergard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2007</LINK>) provided details regarding the use of transfusion protocols, bias may have been introduced, potentially exaggerating the magnitude of beneficial effect of fibrin sealant treatment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Despite the limited data, it appears that the potential benefit of fibrin sealants in reducing allogeneic red cell transfusion and post-operative blood loss is not off-set by the serious adverse effects. However, it is important to note that the studies reviewed here, both individually and in aggregate, are not large enough to draw firm conclusions regarding adverse events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>The majority of reviewed studies were small, with less than 60 participants in each arm. Reliance on small studies raises concerns about the effects of publication bias. Funnel plot assessment (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) indicates that there is some evidence of publication bias in the form of a 'missing population of small negative studies'. To model the effects of publication bias we generated a number of small negative 'unpublished' trials by reversing the results for the treatment and control groups in the small positive trials included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Kjaergard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaergard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobato-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lobato 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sintler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sintler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stutz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecsey-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Vecsey 1980</LINK>). A meta-analysis of this augmented data set showed that the pooled relative risk of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion was reduced from the original estimate of 0.63 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.88) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.03). Given this, the presence of publication bias cannot be discounted and as such the results may need to be viewed with some degree of caution.</P>
<P>In the trials reviewed here, the most significant degree of heterogeneity was found in the analysis of post-operative blood loss (P &lt; 0.00001; I² = 82.3%). Generally the observed variation was in terms of size and not the direction of effect, with data from 10 of 14 trials showing that the use of fibrin sealant statistically significantly reduced post-operative blood loss. No trial reported that fibrin sealant treatment was statistically significantly less effective than control.</P>
<P>To explain the variation in treatment effect, a number of factors were considered including the type of surgery, the timing of blood loss measurement, the type of fibrin sealant used, and the methods used to measure blood loss. However, with the exception of the type of surgery, subgroup analysis was severely constrained by the small number of trials. In the case of allogeneic blood transfusion, stratification of trial data by the type of surgery dramatically reduced the degree of heterogeneity (P = 0.45; I² = 0%). However, in the case of post-operative blood loss, stratification of the data by the type of surgery appeared to reduce the degree of heterogeneity, but it still remained statistically significant (P &lt; 0.1) for each of the four subgroups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trial methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials was particularly poor with less than half of the trials assessed for methodological quality reporting the method used to generate the allocation sequence. Full blinding of outcomes assessment did not occur in any study. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1999</LINK>) used a method of concealing treatment allocation that was judged to be adequate, and 91% of the trials scored 4 or less out of a maximum score of 7 when assessed using the Schulz criteria.</P>
<P>This review like previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2002</LINK>) revealed a lack of large, well-conducted, randomised controlled trials of fibrin sealant. Only one trial included more than 100 patients in each trial arm (<LINK REF="STD-Figueras-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Figueras 2007</LINK>). The current widespread usage of this agent is, therefore, not firmly supported by the available evidence. Although this review represents an important summary of the evidence, the overall results are constrained by the paucity of well-conducted studies of the efficacy of fibrin sealant, defined by reduced blood loss or reduced need for blood transfusion. As the studies reviewed here provided inadequate data for firm conclusions to be drawn about the impact of fibrin sealant use on clinically important endpoints, and given the uncertain generalisability of the results across different clinical settings and different fibrin sealants, further research involving large, methodologically rigorous, randomised controlled trials is recommended.</P>

<P>As an adjunct to surgical sutures, fibrin sealants appear to have a place in reducing operative blood loss; however, firm clinical evidence to support this premise is lacking. As interventions other than fibrin sealants have been shown to be effective in reducing surgical blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2007</LINK>), the clinical decision to use fibrin sealants needs special consideration as in many instances the risks of exposure to fibrin sealants, particularly those prepared from pooled random-donor plasma, may outweigh the benefits. With more stringent donor screening, advances in virucidal treatment processes, and the use of autologous plasma, the risks of disease transmission via fibrin sealants will be further reduced. Other risk reduction measures, such as the replacement of bovine thrombin with human-derived thrombin, and the use of tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid (synthetic anti-fibrinolytics) in place of aprotinin (a bovine-derived anti-fibrinolytic) will further impact on the rates of adverse reactions and the potential for prion-related disease transmission (new variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease) associated with the use of such bovine-derived products. Although recombinant technology may be the future direction as a means of producing a more globally acceptable product, the quality of autologous fibrin sealants has improved and they appear to offer a safe and comparatively effective product.</P>
<P>As the currently available commercial fibrin sealants are not cheap, and are associated with greater risks of disease transmission than autologous fibrin sealants, the decision to choose one product over another needs to be weighed against the potential benefits, harms, and costs of each alternative. The latter is particularly important as the majority of commercially available fibrin sealants are expensive and the commitment of extra resources within a capped health care budget may have an 'opportunity cost' in that resources are not available for more effective interventions that might bring greater benefits to a greater number of patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-09 13:09:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the trials identified by this systematic review, there remains a considerable need for large, well-conducted, randomised controlled trials of fibrin sealant in elective adult surgery. To determine more accurately the impact that fibrin sealants have on peri-operative blood loss and allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and to provide more definitive evidence, future trials should be performed using well-defined transfusion guidelines and collect data on clinically important endpoints. Future trials also need to collect, and report separately, blood loss volumes for both the intra-operative and post-operative periods and not merely report total peri-operative blood loss. Data for allogeneic RBC transfusion needs to be collected and reported in terms of the number of patients transfused (or the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic RBC transfusion) and the volume of blood transfused, for both the intra-operative and post-operative periods.</P>
<P>At present there are insufficient data to allow a definitive conclusion that one fibrin sealant is superior to another in achieving haemostasis and reducing allogeneic RBC transfusion. As the use of fibrin sealants in elective adult surgery will be influenced by availability and cost, future trials should also incorporate economic evaluations into the study design to determine the cost effectiveness of the various agents.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were initially searched using unrestricted search terms with exploded MeSH (medical subject heading) terms and specific text-word terms for fibrin sealant.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The exploded MeSH terms included: 'fibrin tissue adhesive' and 'fibrin glue'.</LI>
<LI>The specific text-word terms included: fibrin glue$, fibrin sealant$, fibrin seal$, biological glue$ or biological seal$, beriplast, bolheal, tissucol, tisseel, quixil, biocol, cryoseal.</LI>
<LI>To maximise the sensitivity for the retrieval of all potentially relevant studies, electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE were initially unrestricted. To improve the specificity of the updated electronic searches two search filters were used.</LI>
<LI>Firstly, the ISPOT filter (<LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1997</LINK>) which identifies blood transfusion trials.</LI>
<LI>Secondly, an RCT filter (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>), which primarily identifies randomised controlled trials.</LI>
<LI>These search filters were coupled with the MeSH headings and the text-word terms for fibrin sealant.</LI>
</UL>
<P>NB: The truncation character "$" (dollar sign) indicates the use of unlimited truncation to retrieve all possible suffix variations of the root word or phrase.</P>
