<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>The best outcomes in childbirth for both mothers and babies are when babies are born head-first. If the baby is in another position, there is a higher risk of complications including the need for caesarean section. In a &#8216;breech presentation&#8217; the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. This review looked for evidence about whether a quicker birth might be better in such cases.</P>
<P>Doctors call the quicker birth &#8216;expedited delivery&#8217;. It means that the baby&#8217;s head appears just one contraction after its tummy has appeared.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Quicker births might prevent babies from not getting enough oxygen. This is a risk in breech births because the cord can get squashed. If the cord is squashed, not enough blood gets to the baby. However, the methods used to make the birth quicker might harm the baby or the mother.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>No reliable studies were found - (we searched for studies up to May 2015).</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>There is no evidence from reliable studies about whether speeding up the birth (&#8216;expedited delivery&#8217;) is helpful if the baby is bottom down.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-26 16:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-26 16:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Breech presentation occurs in 3% to 5% of all pregnancies at term, accounting for the greatest proportion of non-cephalic presentations. Factors which have been associated with breech presentation include: nulliparity; previous breech birth; uterine anomaly; contracted pelvis; use of anticonvulsant drugs; placenta praevia; cornual placenta; decreased or increased amniotic fluid volume; extended fetal legs; multiple pregnancy; prematurity; short umbilical cord; decreased fetal activity; impaired fetal growth; fetal anomaly; and fetal death.</P>
<P>Breech babies tend to be at higher risk of adverse outcomes, with increased neonatal morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2000</LINK>), although it is unclear whether this is due to pre-existing vulnerabilities (perhaps also the factors that caused the initial breech presentation), or the effects of delivery in this position. The interpretation of observational studies that compare outcomes after vaginal breech birth and cephalic birth is confounded by the fact that breech presentation per se appears to be a marker for poor perinatal outcome. For example, the incidence of childhood handicap among singleton breech babies, born at term, has been found to be high (19.4%) and similar for those delivered following trial of labour and those following an elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Danielian-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielian 1996</LINK>). Thus, poor outcomes following vaginal breech birth may be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation rather than damage during delivery. However, the care during labour, the delivery methods used, and skill of the birth attendant may also influence outcome.</P>
<P>Some babies will spontaneously turn to a cephalic position before birth, and others can be rotated using external cephalic version (ECV). Other reviews address whether ECV before term or at term can safely prevent breech delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2006</LINK>), and which interventions can help turn babies using ECV (<LINK REF="REF-Cluver-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluver 2012</LINK>). However, for those babies persisting in the breech position, a decision will need to be taken over the method of delivery. The majority of women with a breech presenting baby would prefer a vaginal birth although most would choose caesarean section if there is a medical indication (<LINK REF="REF-Hildingsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hildingsson 2002</LINK>). For the singleton fetus in breech presentation, caesarean section has been shown to be safer for the fetus than vaginal birth in many settings (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>), although a large prospective study suggested that vaginal breech delivery may be safe under certain conditions with experienced practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 2006</LINK>). In some settings caesarean section may not be possible, vaginal delivery may progress too rapidly to perform a caesarean, or vaginal delivery might be the preferred option.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-13 10:47:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen M West">
<P>During vaginal breech delivery, fetal oxygenation is considered to be potentially impaired once the umbilicus is delivered, due to umbilical cord compression. A conflict exists between the need to deliver the baby rapidly to avoid progressive acidosis, and the need to avoid trauma due to over-hasty delivery.</P>

<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For the next update the quality of the evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Death or serious neonatal morbidity</LI>
<LI>Five-minute Apgar score less than seven</LI>
<LI>Umbilical artery pH less than 7.2</LI>
<LI>Childhood disability or death</LI>
<LI>Maternal trauma</LI>
<LI>Maternal satisfaction</LI>
</OL>
<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) will be used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes will be produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-06-26 16:43:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised, minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>

<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I is greater than 30% and either a Tau is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 16:43:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, we will present the results as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 16:43:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Nulliparous, multiparous, parity mixed or not stated.</LI>
<LI>Suspected fetal compromise, no suspected fetal compromise, fetal compromise mixed or not stated.</LI>
</OL>
<P>All outcomes will be used in subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the &#967;2 statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value.</P>

<P>The hypothesis presented in the excluded study considered (<LINK REF="STD-Arulkumaran-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arulkumaran 1989</LINK>) is that progressive acidosis during the period from exposure of the umbilical cord to delivery of the head may be reduced by expediting the cord-to-head delivery time to occur during a single contraction. The concept appears to be worth subjecting to further randomised evaluation.</P>
