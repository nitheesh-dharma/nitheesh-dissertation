<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 11:27:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The normal urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that lies deep in the pelvis. It functions through the balanced activity of many inter-related nerves and muscles that contain or empty urine as needed. If the bladder has been damaged by disease, surgery can be performed to divert the urine from the bladder (urinary diversion), to reconstruct the bladder or to replace the bladder with intestinal segments. The review did not find enough evidence from trials to show which surgical options are the most effective. One small trial suggested that the ileum bowel segment (small bowel) may be better compared to ileocolonic bowel segment (combination of small and large bowel) for night time incontinence. More research is needed to determine the most effective surgical methods for urinary diversion, reconstruction or replacement of the urinary bladder that has been damaged by disease.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-01-17 11:25:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Surgery performed to improve or replace the function of the diseased urinary bladder has been carried out for over a century. Main reasons for improving or replacing the function of the urinary bladder are bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, detrusor overactivity and chronic inflammatory diseases of the bladder (such as interstitial cystitis, tuberculosis and schistosomiasis). There is still much uncertainty about the best surgical approach. Options available at the present time include: (1) conduit diversion (the creation of various intestinal conduits to the skin) or continent diversion (which includes either a rectal reservoir or continent cutaneous diversion), (2) bladder reconstruction and (3) replacement of the bladder with various intestinal segments. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the best way of improving or replacing the function of the lower urinary tract using intestinal segments when the bladder has to be removed or when it has been rendered useless or dangerous by disease. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-11-07 13:03:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 28 October 2011), which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and CINAHL, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of surgery involving transposition of an intestinal segment into the urinary tract. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-22 16:03:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion and for risk of bias by the review authors. Three review authors were involved in the data extraction. Data were combined in a meta-analysis when appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 11:24:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 355 participants. These trials addressed only five of the 14 comparisons pre-specified in the protocol. One trial reported no statistically significant differences in the incidence of upper urinary tract infection, uretero-intestinal stenosis and renal deterioration in the comparison of continent diversion with conduit diversion. The confidence intervals were all wide, however, and did not rule out important clinical differences. In a second trial, there was no reported difference in the incidence of upper urinary tract infection and uretero-intestinal stenosis when conduit diversions were fashioned from either ileum or colon. A meta-analysis of two trials showed no statistically significant difference in daytime or nocturnal incontinence amongst participants who were randomised to ileocolonic/ileocaecal segment bladder replacement compared to an ileal bladder replacement. However, one small trial suggested that bladder replacement using an ileal segment compared to using an ileocolonic segment may be better in terms of lower rates of nocturnal incontinence. There were no differences in the incidence of dilatation of upper tract, daytime urinary incontinence or wound infection using different intestinal segments for bladder replacement. However the data were reported for 'renal units', but not in a form that allowed appropriate patient-based paired analyses. No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of renal scarring between anti-refluxing versus freely refluxing uretero-intestinal anastomotic techniques in conduit diversions and bladder replacement groups. Again, the outcome data were not reported as paired analysis or in form to carry out paired analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 11:25:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from the included trials was very limited. Only five studies met the inclusion criteria; these were small, of moderate or poor methodological quality, and reported few of the pre-selected outcome measures. This review did not find any evidence that bladder replacement (orthotopic or continent diversion) was better than conduit diversion following cystectomy for cancer. There was no evidence to suggest that bladder reconstruction was better than conduit diversion for benign disease. The clinical significance of data from one small trial suggesting that bladder replacement using an ileal segment compared to using an ileocolonic segment is better in terms of lower rates of nocturnal incontinence is uncertain. The small amount of usable evidence for this review suggests that collaborative multi centre studies should be organised, using random allocation where possible.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-06 15:29:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For over a century, urological surgeons have grappled with the problem of how to improve or replace the function of the lower urinary tract when it has been rendered useless or dangerous by disease.</P>
<P>The lower urinary tract consists of the bladder (reservoir), urethra (conduit) and sphincters (continent mechanism). The normal urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that lies deep in the pelvis. It functions through the balanced activity of many inter-related neural and muscular structures. Co-ordinated reflex activity of the detrusor muscle and sphincter complex results in a low-pressure reservoir for urine storage that is capable of complete emptying through the urethra, in addition to allowing continence between voids. The ideal bladder replacement would have the following attributes:</P>
<P>(1) good volume with low pressure storage;<BR/>(2) socially acceptable voluntary and complete efficient emptying either by valsalva or clean intermittent self catheterisation (CISC);<BR/>(3) allows continence between voids;<BR/>(4) protection of upper urinary tract (kidney and ureter);<BR/>(5) avoidance of harmful long term sequelae and optimise quality of life;<BR/>(6) cost effective.</P>
<P>When the bladder has to be removed or when it has been rendered useless or dangerous by disease, the solutions have ranged from:<BR/>(a) urinary diversion:<BR/>(i) conduit diversion (the creation of various intestinal conduits to the skin);<BR/>(ii) continent diversion (simple drainage by anastomosis (surgical joining) of the ureters to the colon (ureterosigmoidostomy), which include either a rectal reservoir or continent cutaneous diversion);<BR/>(b) the reconstruction of the bladder; or<BR/>(c) replacement of the bladder with various intestinal segments.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Terminology</HEADING>
<P>We used the term continent diversion strictly to mean continent cutaneous diversion, uretero-sigmoidostomy and the newer variants of uretero-sigmoidostomy. By bladder reconstruction we meant that the native bladder was surgically manipulated to improve its function. Whilst for the purpose of this review we only assessed the surgical procedures that made use of intestinal segments as part of the bladder reconstruction (e.g. augmentation cystoplasty or enterocystoplasty), we acknowledge that the true meaning also includes other procedures like detrusor myectomy or auto-augmentation. The terms bladder replacement or substitution were used to mean that the native bladder was removed completely and a new reservoir created, positioned where the native bladder used to be and connected to the native urethra, therefore allowing patients to void in a natural way. The term "undiversion" was taken to mean conversion from conduit to bladder reconstruction, bladder replacement or continent diversion.</P>
<P>Principles underlying the various surgical options are outlined below:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">a) Urinary diversion</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conduit (incontinent) diversion</HEADING>
<P>The ureters are disconnected from the native bladder and anastomosed to the proximal end of a 15 cm (approximately) isolated bowel segment (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 1950</LINK>). The distal end of the bowel segment is brought out through the abdominal wall as a stoma to which a bag is attached to collect the draining urine. Whilst traditionally, small intestine is used, large intestine has also been used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continent diversion</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">i) Continent cutaneous diversion</HEADING>
<P>This involves the creation of a low pressure reservoir of good capacity using a detubularised intestinal segment technique pioneered by Kock et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kock-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kock 1982</LINK>). The disconnected ureters are anastomosed to the reservoir. Various techniques can be used to maintain continence. In the nipple valve principle, the valve protrudes into the reservoir cavity and as the reservoir fills, the valve is compressed preventing incontinence. The flap valve technique relies on the proximal segment of the continence channel running on the inner wall of the reservoir. As the reservoir fills, the channel is compressed preventing incontinence. An alternative approach is to use a flap valve. The most popular type of flap valve is the appendix implanted into the reservoir (Mitrofanoff principle). The distal end of the continence channel is brought out as a stoma through the abdominal wall for clean intermittent self-catheterisation, thus avoiding use of a stoma bag. The main difference compared to the conduit diversion is that the reservoir is internal rather than external (stoma bag use).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">ii) Rectal reservoir</HEADING>
<P>Classical ureterosigmoidostomy has been replaced with the more modern low-pressure rectal reservoir. The ureters are anastomosed to the rectum which acts as the reservoir and the anal sphincter employed to maintain continence. In some of these techniques, attempts are made to limit the admixture of urine and faeces and, in some cases, this involves disconnecting the sigmoid colon and either bringing it out as a stoma or, more commonly, through the perineum. By doing the latter, both urinary and bowel control can be maintained. Some techniques use proximal intussusception of the sigmoid colon to confine urine to a smaller surface area hence limiting the metabolic disturbance seen in the classical ureterosigmoidostomy (<LINK REF="REF-Kock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kock 1988</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">b) Bladder reconstruction</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Augmentation cystoplasty/enterocystoplasty</HEADING>
<P>Mikulicz in 1899 (<LINK REF="REF-Mikulicz-1899" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikulicz 1899</LINK>) was the first to describe using a segment of ileum to perform an augmentation onto a coronally bisected human bladder. Clam enterocystoplasty described by Bramble (<LINK REF="REF-Bramble-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramble 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bramble-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramble 1990</LINK>) was therefore a modified technique and involved the incorporation of a detubularised isolated bowel segment onto a near-complete sagittally bisected bladder.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">c) Bladder replacement or substitution</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Orthotopic neobladder</I>
<BR/>In orthotopic (in the normal or usual place) bladder replacement, creation of the neobladder and its anastomosis to the disconnected ureters uses the same principles as in continent cutaneous diversion surgery. For the outlet, the reservoir is anastomosed to the native urethra and therefore patients can maintain continence (if the native sphincter mechanism is still intact) and void via their native urethra. If patients encounter difficulty emptying the reservoir, they can perform clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC). The proportion needing to perform CISC following orthotopic reconstruction varied in different series from 0% to 70%. The remaining patients learnt to recognise when the neo-bladder was full and strained to void. The technique of CISC is well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Lapides-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapides 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webb-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regardless of the bowel segment used to augment or create a neo-bladder, results were relatively satisfactory if the bowel was detubularised and a spherical-shaped reservoir created. Contractile activity thereafter became discontinuous and disorganised reducing the pressure within the reconstructed bladder hence decreasing the chances of post-operative incontinence. Critical to the success of any urinary diversion is the creation of a safe uretero-intestinal anastomosis that is prone neither to leakage nor stricture. As a freely refluxing anastomosis could lead to upper tract dilatation in the presence of phasic intestinal contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Neal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 1989</LINK>), the alternative historically, was the use of an anti-reflux anastomotic technique. However, this carried a higher risk of upper tract obstruction because of stricture formation. More recently, Stüder et al (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) reported that the deleterious effect of reflux could be eliminated by implantation of the ureters into an afferent, tubular, iso-peristaltic 20 cm length of ileum without the use of an anti-reflux anastomotic technique. There is therefore a dilemma between the use of a refluxing anastomosis with a reportedly lower stricture rate, but with the potential to cause renal damage and the use of an anti-refluxing anastomosis with a reportedly higher stricture rate, but with less potential to cause renal damage (if not stenotic).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reasons for urinary diversion or bladder reconstruction /replacement</HEADING>
<P>The main indications for performing a urinary diversion or a bladder reconstruction/replacement using transposed intestinal segments are bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, idiopathic detrusor overactivity and chronic inflammatory conditions (such as interstitial cystitis, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and post-radiation bladder contraction).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Bladder cancer</HEADING>
<P>People with muscle invasive bladder cancer require aggressive treatment which usually means either radiotherapy or cystectomy (surgery to remove the bladder) with or without chemotherapy. If the decision is radical cystectomy, the choice of how to replace lower urinary tract function rests between conduit diversion, bladder replacement or continent diversion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Neurogenic bladder dysfunction</HEADING>
<P>This may result from congenital or acquired disorders (e.g. neural tube defect or spinal cord injured patients) and can present clinically in a number of ways including frequency, urgency, urinary incontinence, intermittency, urinary retention or urinary tract infections. Dysfunction of the lower urinary tract may result in vesico-ureteric reflux or impaired drainage of the ureters resulting in hydronephrosis. Before the era of clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC), many patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction had their urine diverted by means of an ileal conduit when conservative measures failed. Nowadays, however, the options would include either bladder reconstruction, replacement or continent diversion. The main indications for such surgery in this group of patients include intractable incontinence, deteriorating renal function and high bladder pressures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Detrusor overactivity</HEADING>
<P>Detrusor overactivity is characterised by detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contractions either spontaneously or on provocation during the filling phase while the patient is attempting to inhibit micturition. The urological management of people with detrusor instability (DI) is difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Couillard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couillard 1995</LINK>). Patients with severe detrusor instability are distressed by urinary incontinence and often desperate for treatment. The majority of patients with detrusor instability are treated conservatively using drug therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or S3-neuromodulation. If conservative measures fail however, surgery which may involve transposition of intestinal segments into the urinary tract (e.g. Clam enterocystoplasty) can provide effective treatment for some patients (<LINK REF="REF-George-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kockelbergh-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kockelbergh 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sethia-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethia 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chronic inflammatory disorders of the bladder</HEADING>
<P>
<I>(a) Interstitial Cystitis</I>
<BR/>Idiopathic interstitial cystitis is a chronic inflammatory bladder disorder of unknown aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Hanno-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanno 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>). In most patients conservative treatments produce only temporary relief and in some there is progressive deterioration which often culminates in a request for surgical treatment. The options range from ileal conduit diversion to orthotopic bladder replacement, but choosing patients who will benefit from surgery is difficult.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) Tuberculosis</I>
<BR/>The World Health Organisation estimates that there are approximately 10 million new cases of all forms of tuberculosis each year predominantly affecting people living in developing countries. It is estimated that between 8 to 20 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis have Mycobacterium tuberculosis in their urine. Tuberculosis can affect the entire genito-urinary tract. When it affects the bladder, it may result in intolerable frequency, pain, urgency and haematuria. The bladder can become small, contracted and incapable of holding more than 100 ml of urine, which may lead to treatment by augmentation cystoplasty.</P>
<P>The purpose of the review was to provide an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review which would not only help to identify optimal practice, but also highlight gaps in the evidence base.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the best way of improving or replacing the function of the lower urinary tract using intestinal segments when the bladder has to be removed or when it had been rendered useless or dangerous by disease.</P>
<P>The following comparisons were pre-stated:</P>
<P>(1) whether continent diversion is better than conduit diversion;</P>
<P>(2) whether bladder reconstruction is better than conduit diversion;</P>
<P>(3) whether bladder reconstruction is better than continent diversion;</P>
<P>(4) whether bladder reconstruction is better than bladder replacement;</P>
<P>(5) whether bladder replacement is better than conduit diversion;</P>
<P>(6) whether bladder replacement is better than continent diversion;</P>
<P>(7) whether one form of continent diversion is better than another;</P>
<P>(8) whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut for bladder reconstruction is better than a segment from another part;</P>
<P>(9) whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut for bladder replacement is better than a segment from another part;</P>
<P>(10) whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut for continent cutaneous diversion is better than a segment from another part;</P>
<P>(11) whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut for conduit diversion is better than a segment from another part;</P>
<P>(12) whether the use of an anti-reflux uretero-intestinal anastomotic technique is better than a freely refluxing anastomosis in bladder replacement;</P>
<P>(13) whether the use of an anti-reflux uretero-intestinal anastomotic technique is better than a freely refluxing anastomosis in continent diversion;</P>
<P>(14) whether the use of an anti-reflux uretero-intestinal anastomotic technique is better than a freely refluxing anastomosis in conduit diversion.</P>
<P>Whilst we understood that there were important issues of choice within these broad groups, which deserved a review of the evidence in their own right, for instance, choice of continence mechanism in bladder replacement or the choice of outlet in continent cutaneous diversion, these were not considered in this review. </P>

<P>The five included trials had a total of 355 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>). All were randomised trials. For two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) the report of longer-term follow-up was considered as the primary report by the reviewers. The first of these two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) was originally carried out in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Studer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Studer 1991</LINK>) and the second (<LINK REF="REF-Kristjansson-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjansson 1995a</LINK>) in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Mansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansson 1989</LINK>). This trial (<LINK REF="REF-Mansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansson 1989</LINK>), had essentially one subsequent follow-up report with different outcome measures reported in two papers in the same volume of the British Journal of Urology. These two follow-up papers had the same first author (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>). The first paper, which had the same outcome measures (renal function, uretero-intestinal strictures and incidence of urinary tract infections) as the original report (<LINK REF="REF-Mansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansson 1989</LINK>), was assigned as the primary reference (<LINK REF="REF-Kristjansson-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjansson 1995a</LINK>) as it had the longest follow-up on the original group of patients studied. The second paper by Kristjansson et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kristjansson-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjansson 1995b</LINK>) reported on the incidence of renal scarring (determined by renal scintigraphy) and location of bacteriuria (detected by urine sampling from the conduit and direct renal pelvis percutaneous aspiration). Whilst Studer refers to the afferent ileal tubular segment as a dynamic anti-reflux device under low pressure conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>), the anastomosis of the ureters to the ileal segment is that of a freely refluxing anastomosis and for the purposes of this review is classified as such.</P>

One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Ghoneim-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Ghoneim 1981</LINK>) appeared to fulfil the criteria of the review, but was not included as the authors did not report the number of patients in each treatment group. This omission did not allow analysis of the data presented. This trial compared refluxing versus non-refluxing techniques in a continent diversion (ureterosigmoidostomy) looking at outcome measures of upper tract dilatation and incidence of day / night time incontinence. The reviewers are attempting to contact the authors about providing further data, and will update the review accordingly if successful.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons on interventions and outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The first included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) compared an anti-reflux mechanism (anti-reflux nipple) against a refluxing mechanism (afferent ileal tubular segment). Outcome measures that this trial looked at included number of patients with pyelonephritis (no incidence of hospitalisation mentioned), number with urinary incontinence, number with uretero-intestinal stenosis and physiological / radiological measures such as the incidence of active reflux, upper tract dilatation, lower urinary stones, vitamin B12 deficiency and increase in kidney size.</P>
<P>Kristjamsson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>) compared (1) Continent diversion vs Conduit diversion, (2) Anti-reflux mechanism vs refluxing mechanism for the conduit diversion and (3) One segment (ileal) vs another (colon) for conduit diversion. Outcome measures for the first comparison (continent vs conduit diversion) included the number of patients with upper urinary tract infection (no incidence of hospitalisation mentioned), number with uretero-intestinal stenosis and physiological / radiological measures such as the glomerular filtration rate and presence of renal scarring as measured by renal scintigraphy. The outcome measures for the second comparison (anti-reflux vs reflux for conduit diversion) included physiological / radiological measures such as the presence of renal scarring as measured by renal scintigraphy. Finally, the outcome measure for the third comparison (one segment vs another for conduit diversion) included the number of patients with upper urinary tract infection (no hospitalisation mentioned), number with uretero-intestinal stenosis and physiological / radiological measures such as the glomerular filtration rate and presence of renal scarring as determined by renal scintigraphy.</P>
<P>Khafagy and Chen (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) compared the outcomes of two different types of bowel segments used in bladder replacement. Khafagy (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) compared ileocaecal with an ileal segment (Studer technique) and Chen (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) compared ileocolonic (Le Bag technique) with an ileal segment. Le Bag technique used in the Chen (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) study used a freely refluxing Bricker anastomosis where as in the Khafagy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) the ileocaecal procedure was non-refluxing. Both trials included outcomes measures on early complications (urinary leakage, wound infections etc.) urinary incontinence; serum biochemistry and radiological changes of the upper tract as seen on intravenous urograms.</P>
<P>Shaaban et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>) compared outcomes of refluxing and anti-refluxing techniques of uretero-enteric anastomosis in patients with bladder replacement. Renal units ( left or right) were randomised to techniques in the same patient. Randomisation was carried out for the technique and not for the patients. Outcomes of interest in this study were: early complications; dilatation of upper tract ( including due to strictures); follow-up glomerular filtration rates; and requirement of secondary surgical interventions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants and sample characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Studer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) had a total number of 70 participants with 35 allocated to the group with the anti-reflux nipple mechanism and 35 to the remaining group with the refluxing mechanism (afferent ileal tubular segment). All the trial patients were male with a median age of 66.6 years in the anti-reflux nipple mechanism group and 63.8 years in the afferent ileal tubular segment group. The reported median follow-up was 57 months for the group with the anti-reflux nipple mechanism and 45 months for the group with the afferent ileal tubular segment. There was no specific mention of the inclusion criteria of patients into the trial, although it was reported that a proportion of the patients underwent radical cystectomy and subsequent bladder replacement for bladder cancer.</P>
<P>Kristjansson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>) originally had 94 participants in their trial as reported in 1989, with 38 patients prospectively randomised to have formation of ileal conduit, 30 patients had formation of colonic conduit and the remaining 26 patients had formation of a continent caecal reservoir. The authors reported that only 56 patients were evaluable at the end of the study period with 38 unevaluable patients. No reasons were given as to why these 38 patients were not evaluable. Therefore, the final numbers for the purposes of evaluation were: 18 patients for the ileal conduit group, 20 patients for the colonic conduit group and 18 patients for the continent caecal reservoir group. There were 43 male patients and 13 female patients. The reported mean age was 60 years for both the ileal conduit and colonic conduit group. The reported mean age for the caecal reservoir group was 50 years. The reported mean follow-up was 121 months for the ileal conduit group, 117 months for the colonic conduit group and 132 months for the continent caecal reservoir group. Of the original 94 patients, 88 patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion whereas the remaining 6 patients had simple cystectomy and urinary diversion for neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The inclusion criteria included invasive bladder cancer and neurogenic bladder dysfunction.</P>
<P>Shaaban et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>) had 60 patients in their study. A mean follow-up of 23 months was available for 53 patients. They were generally healthy with no major co-morbidity and all were undergoing ileal bladder replacement.</P>
<P>Khafagy et al (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) randomised 60 patients into two groups depending on the type of bowel segment used for bladder replacement. Group one patients had ileal neobladder reconstruction and group two patients had ileocaecal neobladder reconstruction following radical cystectomy. All participants had undergone radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) included 71 male patients randomised to ileocolonic segment (Le Bag) or ileal segment (Studer technique). Urodynamic parameters and continence rates were measured at 6 months.</P>

When the random allocation was to different sides (renal units) as reported by Shabaan et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>), the issue is similar to cross-over trails, where people are randomised but the analysis is paired on renal units. The issue is like cluster trial of two units per cluster. The other four hypotheses were addressed by only single trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypothesis 1: Whether continent diversion is better than conduit diversion [see comparison 1].</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>) provided data for evaluation of this comparison. In this trial, two types of conduit diversions [ileal (n = 18) and colonic (n = 20)] and caecal continent diversion (n = 8) were used for the treatment of patients. For the statistical analysis, the combined outcome measures of the ileal and colonic conduit diversions (n = 38) were compared to the outcome measures of the caecal continent diversion. There were no statistically significant differences in the relative risks of upper urinary tract infection, number with uretero-intestinal stenosis, incidence of glomerular filtration rate deterioration (of more than 25%) and renal scarring. The confidence intervals were all wide, however, and did not rule out clinically important differences.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypothesis 9: Whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut for bladder replacement is better than a segment from another part [see comparison 9].</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) reported on the comparison between two different bowel segments (ileal and ileocolonic <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK> and ileal and ileocaecal <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) in the treatment of patients with bladder replacement. The meta analysis did not show any difference in daytime incontinence but with wide confidence intervals. The meta-analysis showed heterogeneity for the nocturnal incontinence outcome, hence we used a random effects model. The combined result of the two trials did not show a statistically significant result for nocturnal incontinence (RR 0.62: 95% CI 0.13 to 2.87, <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>). However, the Chen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) alone did favour the ileal neobladder over the ileocolonic segment using the "Le Bag" technique which used a freely refluxing technique (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79. The Khafagy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) used a non-refluxing technique with the ileocaecal segment. Chen (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) measured continence at 6 months postoperatively and classified continence as unsatisfactory if the patient used more than one pad in the day or night. In the ileocolonic group, one patient developed a fistula from the ileocolonic anastomosis to the skin and one developed urethral stenosis due to infection. In the ileal neobladder group, one patient developed stenosis of the ileoposterior urethral anastomosis and one developed stenosis of the ileoureteral anastomosis. Analysis of complication data could not be carried out in case of double counting participants.</P>
<P>In the Khafagy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) patients who had ileal neobladder (n = 29) were compared with patients who had ileocaecal neobladder (n = 31). Three in each group developed urinary incontinence, three and one wound infection were reported respectively in the two groups. Data for dilatation of the upper urinary tract was reported for 'renal units', but not in a form that allowed appropriate patient-based analyses (eight units were affected in those allocated to ileal neobladder compared with four in the ileo-caecal neobladder). The trial reported a similar continence rate between the two procedures. However, there was a higher rate of acidosis, infections and high residual urine in the ileal neobladder group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypothesis 11: Whether use of an intestinal segment from one part of the gut (ileum) for conduit diversion is better than a segment from another part (colon) [see comparison 11].</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>) allowed comparison of outcome measures between two different gut segments (ileal and colon) in the treatment of patients with conduit diversion. Patients who had ileal conduit formation (n = 18) were compared with patients who had colonic conduit formation (n = 20). Data were available for only two outcome measures. There were no statistically significant differences in the relative risks of upper urinary tract infection and uretero-intestinal stenosis. Again, confidence intervals were wide and compatible with large clinical differences.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypothesis 12: Whether the use of an anti-reflux uretero-intestinal anastomotic technique is better than a freely refluxing anastomosis in bladder replacement [see comparison 12].</HEADING>
<P>The trial by Studer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) compared an anti-reflux mechanism (nipple valve) against a freely refluxing mechanism (afferent ileal tubular segment) in bladder replacement. Data were available for five outcome measures. There were no statistically significant differences in respect of four of these: upper urinary tract infection, daytime incontinence, nighttime incontinence, and uretero-intestinal anastomotic strictures. Confidence intervals were all wide and clinically important differences were not ruled out. There was a marginally statistically significant difference in the incidence of upper tract dilatation, suggesting a higher rate after nipple value treatment, but this was based on only 11 cases and the confidence interval was wide (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96, <LINK REF="CMP-012.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial by Shaaban et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>) compared refluxing and antirefluxing techniques of uretero-enteric anastomosis in different renal units for the same patient. Unfortunately they reported neither paired analysis nor data in a form to allow paired analysis. Of the 53 renal units allocated to direct uretero-ileal anastomosis technique, one was reported to be obstructed compared to be five amongst those with an anti-refluxive anastomosis. The equivalent figure for reflux were 44 out of 53 versus 6 out of 63; however all five of the obstructed anastomoses had reflux after the obstruction had been corrected, bringing the total of the antireflux group to 11 out of 53. Data on glomerular filtration rates were only reported graphically, but the figure and commentary indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups of the renal units.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypothesis 14: Whether the use of an anti-reflux uretero-intestinal anastomotic technique is better than a freely refluxing anastomosis in conduit diversion [see comparison 14].</HEADING>
<P>The trial by Kristjansson et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kristjansson-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjansson 1995b</LINK>) also compared an anti-reflux technique and a freely refluxing anastomosis used in the formation of ileal and colonic conduit diversion. Data were only available for one outcome, the incidence of renal scarring. The authors reported renal units affected rather than the number of patients affected. No statistically significant difference was found between the two techniques and the confidence intervals were wide (risk ratio 1.94; 95% CI 0.92 to 4.08); this analysis does not take into account 'clustering' due to the paired renal units.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 15:46:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were few randomised trials that addressed the objectives of the review. From a total of 25 studies that were identified, only five trials were suitable for data analysis. Data from two trials on the outcome of upper tracts (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) was reported as 'renal units', not in a form to perform paired analysis. No data from eligible trials were available to address 9 of the 14 pre-stated comparisons and the data from the five eligible trials that were considered were very limited. The outcome measures that were reported did not include a large proportion of the outcome measures that the reviewers felt were important to the review. It was therefore not possible to comment on a significant number of outcome measures. In particular, there was lack of data on outcome measures that looked at patient symptoms and patient quality of life in general. There was lack of data on clinical end points such as the immediate, medium-term and long-term problems encountered by patients post-urinary diversion. Trials did not report on the incidence of cancer development post-urinary diversion. There was no data regarding health economic measures such as the cost of alternative management, the costs of effects of management and formal cost-effectiveness analyses. Some data on physiological / radiological measures were found, such as the incidences of active reflux, upper tract dilatation, lower urinary tract stones, vitamin B12 deficiency, deterioration of glomerular filtration rate (more than 25% in the trial reported) and renal scarring. However data on the incidences of physiological / radiological measures such as upper urinary tract stones, metabolic bone disease, metabolic acidosis / alkalosis, bile acid malabsorption and hepatic encephalopathy were not found. The incidence of renal failure was not specifically reported. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>) reported on the incidence of glomerular filtration rate deterioration of more than 25%. This is probably important as it suggests significant and progressive impairment that is likely to lead to dialysis in the future. However, it would have been useful to know how many of these patients with deterioration in renal function actually proceeded to dialysis or re-operation.</P>
<P>Where data were available their usefulness was severely limited by the small sizes of the trials and hence the few participants who experienced any of the outcomes. The confidence intervals around all the estimates were wide and important differences could not be ruled out (or in) with any assurance.<BR/>
<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) reported a higher rate of post-void residual urine and biochemical acidosis in patients with bladder replacement using ileal segment of the intestine as compared to the ileocaecal segment. The arterial pH was measured every three monthly in both the groups and was reported significantly higher in the ileal neobladder (mean 7.39 versus 7.41). The clinical significance and long-term outcome of this biochemical results were not stated. There was no differences in the follow-up serum creatinine between the two groups. The results from this trial need to be interpreted with caution due to small number of participants and short follow-up of 2 years.</P>
<P>The data on nocturnal incontinence for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) was conflicting. The small Chen study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) showed a statistically significant result favouring the ileal neobladder over an ileocolonic bladder whereas the data from the similar sized Khafagy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>) showed no statistically significant difference between the ileal neobladder and ileocaecal bladder. Analysis of urodynamic variables suggested that the pressure rise during artificial bladder filling (compliance) was slightly higher on average in those patients with ileocolonic neobladder which may contribute to increased risk of nocturnal incontinence.  All other urodynamic variables including capacity and urethral closure pressure were similar between the two types of bladder replacement.  The cause and longer term consequences of the increased rate of nocturnal incontinence in patients with ileocolonic neobladder therefore remain uncertain and require exploration in further larger studies with longer follow up. </P>
<P>One marginally statistically significant result was found (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>). This should be interpreted cautiously for the reasons outlined above and also because the authors used renal units (<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristjansson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) and not actual patient numbers when reporting on the outcome measures of upper tract dilatation and renal scarring respectively. Because the kidneys in an individual participant cannot be considered independent (if one side is affected, it is more likely that the other side will be affected too), the level of statistical significance is likely to be spuriously high. Studer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Studer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Studer 1996</LINK>) reported that patients treated with formation of afferent tubular ileal segment for bladder replacement had significantly less upper tract dilatation when compared to those treated with anti-reflux nipples. The afferent ileal tubular segment is said to be a dynamic anti-reflux device under low-pressure conditions. An afferent limb has an inherently higher pressure, per square centimetre, when compared to a larger volume bladder replacement and it is by this intrinsic property that afferent limbs are thought to work, preventing reflux into the ureters that are anastomosed proximally to the afferent limb. It is thought that the longer the afferent limb, the greater the resistance to reverse flow. It was noted that the authors in this trial used the terms of upper tract dilatation and obstruction interchangeably when describing their results. It cannot be assumed that all patients with upper tract dilatation will have clinically significant obstruction, or vice versa. It would have been more meaningful for the authors to have perhaps measured the renal function of these patients with upper tract dilatation and to have reported on the incidence of such patients progressing on to re-operation or dialysis. Again, it is unclear as to how clinically significant the results may be, as a patient with unilateral upper tract dilatation or renal scarring may conceivably have normal renal function. This underlines the need for caution when interpreting these results.</P>
<P>It is important to note that broader evidence on the topics of this review come from non-comparative or non-randomised studies. These were not considered in this review because of the likelihood of bias distorting their interpretation. However, in a separate systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2005</LINK>) of non-randomised studies, the authors concluded that the level and quality of evidence was poor and added little to the randomised trials. There is clearly a need for more randomised trials. The commonest condition resulting in the need for cystectomy and transposing intestinal segments into the urinary tract in the Western world is advanced bladder cancer. There were 10,335 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in the UK in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Office-for-National-Statistics-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Office for National Statistics 2002</LINK>) The condition and procedures are common enough for a prospective randomised trial to be possible in addition to having considerable cost implications to the National Health Service every year. Where randomisation of a patient population is not possible or inappropriate, then an alternative robust method of determining outcome of 'competing' surgical procedures should be used, for example, a partially randomised patient preference study or a comprehensive cohort design.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-06 15:42:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One small study found higher rates of nocturnal incontinence amongst patients having an ileocolonic bladder replacement compared with an ileal bladder replacement. This study was small and reported few methodological details, longer term outcome was not assessed. This review did not find any evidence that either bladder replacement or continent diversion was better than conduit diversion, or vice versa. There is clearly an absence of good quality data in the literature despite the fact that such surgery is commonplace and has been so for many decades. In conduit diversion, the review did not find any evidence that using a segment of ileum was any more advantageous than using a segment of colon, or vice versa in either bladder replacement or continent diversion. Similarly, no difference was found in using either freely refluxing or anti-refluxing techniques for conduit diversion from the available evidence. The data reviewed would appear to suggest that afferent ileal tubular segment is less likely to cause upper tract dilatation compared to the anti-reflux nipples, but even this finding should be interpreted cautiously. Until better evidence becomes available (see below), practice will continue to be dictated by local patient, surgeon and cost factors, together with poorly evaluated advances in surgical technology.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-17 15:47:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for more randomised trials comparing different surgical techniques. Investigators need to look at more comprehensive outcome measures particularly emphasising relevant clinical end points as detailed in this review, quality of life issues and health economic measures. Because relatively small number of patients are treated in individual centres, this will require multi centre collaboration. Where randomisation is difficult or inappropriate other approaches, such as partially randomised patient preference designs or comprehensive cohort studies, should be used. Given the wide scope of treatment options and the paucity of high level evidence it would be important to gain consensus amongst patients, clinicians and health care managers concerning the key research questions and their relative priority.</P>
