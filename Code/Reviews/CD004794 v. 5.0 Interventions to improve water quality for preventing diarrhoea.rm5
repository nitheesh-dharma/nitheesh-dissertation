<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-12 14:32:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review summarizes trials evaluating different interventions to improve water quality and prevent diarrhoea. After searching for relevant trials up to 11 November 2014, we included 55 studies enrolling over 84,000 participants. Most included studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) (50 studies), with unimproved water sources (30 studies), and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies).</P>
<P>
<B>What causes diarrhoea and what water quality interventions might prevent diarrhoea?</B>
</P>
<P>Diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially among young children in low-income countries where the most common causes are faecally contaminated water and food, or poor hygiene practices.</P>
<P>In remote and low-income settings, source-based water quality improvement may include providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes) or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). Alternatively water may be treated at the point-of-use in people's homes by boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection. These point-of-use interventions have the potential to overcome both contaminated sources and recontamination of safe water in the home.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says</B>
</P>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to know if source-based improvements in water supplies, such as protected wells and communal tap stands or treatment of communal supplies, consistently reduce diarrhoea in low-income settings (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). We found no trials evaluating reliable piped-in water supplies to people's homes.</P>
<P>On average, distributing disinfection products for use in the home may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter in the case of chlorine products (<I>low quality evidence</I>), and around a third in the case of flocculation and disinfection sachets (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Water filtration at home probably reduces diarrhoea by around a half (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and effects were consistently seen with ceramic filters (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), biosand systems (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>) and LifeStraw® filters (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Plumbed-in filtration has only been evaluated in high-income settings (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In low-income settings, distributing plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Research assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. Evidence indicates the more people use the various interventions for improving water quality, the larger the effects, so research into practical approaches to increase coverage and help assure long term use of them in poor groups will help improve impact.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-12 12:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially among young children in low-income countries. In these settings, many infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are spread through water contaminated with faeces.</P>
<P>In remote and low-income settings, source-based water quality improvement includes providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes), or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). Point-of-use water quality improvement interventions include boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection, mainly conducted at home.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve water quality for preventing diarrhoea.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-21 09:42:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (11 November 2014), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 7 November 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to 10 November 2014), EMBASE (1974 to 10 November 2014), and LILACS (1982 to 7 November 2014). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked references from identified studies through 11 November 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-09-18 19:02:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) comparing interventions aimed at improving the microbiological quality of drinking water with no intervention in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-05 15:13:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, where appropriate, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-05 15:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-five cluster-RCTs, two quasi-RCTs, and eight CBA studies, including over 84,000 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most included studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) (50 studies) with unimproved water sources (30 studies) and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies). The primary outcome in most studies was self-reported diarrhoea, which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding in over 80% of the included studies.</P>
<P>
<I>Source-based water quality improvements</I>
</P>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to know if source-based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (one cluster-RCT, five CBA studies, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). We found no studies evaluating reliable piped-in water supplies delivered to households.</P>
<P>
<I>Point-of-use water quality interventions</I>
</P>
<P>On average, distributing water disinfection products for use at the household level may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (Home chlorination products: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>; flocculation and disinfection sachets: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82, four trials, 11,788 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect estimates between individual studies.</P>
<P>Point-of-use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59, 18 trials, 15,582 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Important reductions in diarrhoea episodes were shown with ceramic filters, biosand systems and LifeStraw® filters; (Ceramic: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; eight trials, 5763 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; Biosand: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; four trials, 5504 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; LifeStraw®: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Plumbed in filters have only been evaluated in high-income settings (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94, three trials, 1056 participants, fixed effects model).</P>
<P>In low-income settings, solar water disinfection (SODIS) by distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container. In most cases, the reduction in diarrhoea shown in the studies was evident in settings with improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-05 15:41:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions that address the microbial contamination of water at the point-of-use may be important interim measures to improve drinking water quality until homes can be reached with safe, reliable, piped-in water connections. The average estimates of effect for each individual point-of-use intervention generally show important effects. Comparisons between these estimates do not provide evidence of superiority of one intervention over another, as such comparisons are confounded by the study setting, design, and population.</P>
<P>Further studies assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. As evidence suggests effectiveness improves with adherence, studies assessing programmatic approaches to optimising coverage and long-term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations could also help strategies to improve health outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-13 12:30:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-18 21:12:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of mortality in low-income countries, causing an estimated 1.4 million deaths in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-GBD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD 2015</LINK>). Young children are especially vulnerable, with diarrhoea accounting for more than a quarter of all deaths in children aged under five years in Africa and Southeast Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanata-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanata 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens causing diarrhoeal disease are primarily transmitted via the faecal-oral route, through the consumption of faecally contaminated food and water (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 2001</LINK>). Among the most important of these are rotavirus, <I>Cryptosporidium sp</I>.,<I> Escherichia coli</I>,<I> Salmonella sp</I>.,<I> Shigella sp</I>.,<I> Campylobacter jejuni</I>,<I> Vibrio cholerae</I>, norovirus, <I>Giardia lamblia</I>, and <I>Entamoeba histolytica </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotloff-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotloff 2013</LINK>), though the relative importance of these varies among settings, seasons, and population groups. </P>
<P>An estimated 1.1 billion people worldwide rely on water supplies that are at high risk of faecal contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2014</LINK>). Moreover, nearly half the world's population lack household water connections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2015</LINK>), and are at increased risk of unsafe water due to contamination during collection, storage, and use in the home (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-13 12:30:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions to improve the microbiological quality of water can be grouped into four main categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Physical removal of pathogens (for example, filtration, adsorption, or sedimentation).</LI>
<LI>Chemical treatment to kill or deactivate pathogens (most commonly with chlorine).</LI>
<LI>Disinfection by heat (for example, boiling or pasturization) or ultraviolet (UV) radiation (for example, solar disinfection, or artificial UV lamps).</LI>
<LI>Combination of these approaches (for example, filtration or flocculation combined with disinfection).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In higher-income countries, and in many urban settings worldwide, drinking water is treated centrally at the source of supply and distributed to consumers through a network of pipes and household taps. Alternatively, water may be treated at any point in the distribution network, or at the 'point-of-use' (POU) in people's homes, schools, or workplaces.</P>
<P>In remote and low-income settings, source-based water quality improvement may include providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes) or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). These improvements frequently also improve both the quantity and access to water by increasing the volume or frequency of water delivery or reducing the time spent in collecting water. This may result in significant benefits not only in health but also in economic and social welfare (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stelmach-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stelmach 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potential and widely used POU interventions for remote or low-income settings include boiling, filtration, chlorination, flocculation, and solar disinfection. These interventions have the potential to overcome both contaminated sources and recontamination of safe water in the home (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2004</LINK>). A review commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a wide variety of options for household-based water treatment and assessed the available evidence on their microbiological effectiveness, health impact, acceptability, affordability, sustainability, and scalability (<LINK REF="REF-Sobsey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobsey 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-18 19:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Health authorities generally accept that microbiologically safe water plays an important role in preventing outbreaks of waterborne diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2008</LINK>). Moreover, there is evidence that chlorination and filtration of municipal water supplies contributed to substantial health gains in the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> and early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, much of the epidemiological evidence for increased health benefits following improvements in the quality of drinking water has been equivocal, particularly in low-income settings (<LINK REF="REF-Clasen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clasen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddington-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddington 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cairncross-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairncross 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This may be due to the variety of alternative transmission pathways, such as ingestion of contaminated food, person-to-person contact, or direct contact with infected faeces. In addition, interventions which only target the home may fail if unsafe water is consumed at work or school. Consequently, effective programmes may require combined interventions to address not only water quality, but also water quantity and access, the proper disposal of human faeces (sanitation), and the promotion of hand washing and hygiene practices within communities.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of individual water quality interventions may also vary between settings due to the varied prevalence of the organisms causing diarrhoea. For instance, ceramic filters are only marginally protective against viral illness, while chlorination may provide little protection against <I>Cryptosporidium</I>.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-18 19:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first completed in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Clasen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clasen 2006</LINK>). The review concluded that, in general, interventions to improve microbiological quality of drinking water are effective in preventing diarrhoea, and that interventions at the household level were more effective than those at the source.</P>
<P>New studies have been recently published, and other unpublished studies have been made available to us. In this Cochrane Review update, we have reapplied the inclusion criteria, repeated data extraction, added new studies, and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We were also able to apply statistical methods to unify the measures of effect and to apply additional criteria for subgrouping based on study design, setting, and length of follow-up.</P>

In using these various measures of effect, we noted the design effect in treating all such measures of effect as equivalent for common outcomes such as diarrhoea and the debate about methodologies for converting such measures of effect into a single measure (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNutt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNutt 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>We summarized the evidence using 'Summary of findings' tables that we created using the GRADE Guideline Development Tool (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>).

<P>In the subgroup analyses based on water source, we followed terminology used by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) on Water and Sanitation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2015</LINK>), using 'unimproved' to extend to unprotected wells or springs, vendor- or tanker-provided water or bottled water, and 'improved' to extend to household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells or springs, or rainwater collection; we categorized studies as 'unclear' with respect to water supply if they contained insufficient information.</P>
<P>We used the same definitions from the WHO/UNICEF JMP criteria to classify sanitation conditions as 'improved' (connection to a public sewer or septic system, pour-flush latrine, simple pit latrine, ventilated improved pit latrine) or 'unimproved' (service or bucket latrines, public latrines, open latrines); where the necessary information was unclear or unreported, we categorized the sanitation facilities as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>To subgroup studies based on access to water source, we used the classifications defined by the <LINK REF="REF-Sphere-Project-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sphere Project 2011</LINK>, classifying access as 'sufficient' if a consistently available source was located within 500 m, with queuing no more than 15 minutes and filling time for a 20 L container no more than three minutes, 'insufficient' if any access failed any such criteria, and 'unclear' if such criteria was unreported or unclear.</P>
<P>The quantity of water available to study participants was considered 'sufficient' if consisting of a minimum of 15 L per person per day.

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-10-13 12:31:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of the results to each of the 'Risk of bias' components by including only studies that were at low risk of bias. We used this information to guide our judgements on the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>In addition, we explored the impact of non-blinding of POU interventions using a Bayesian meta-analysis with bias correction. For this purpose, we assumed the true log relative risks from non-blinding studies are subject to a multiplicative bias that results in the observed relative risks being inflated in magnitude. We assumed the bias is normally distributed with a mean 1.48 or 1.65 and a corresponding standard deviation (SD) of 0.17 or 0.13. These values were derived from the additive bias correction employed in <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>. While we believe an attempt to adjust for non-blinding is appropriate, we urge caution in relying on these adjusted estimates since the basis for the adjustment is from clinical (mainly drug) studies that may not be transferable to field studies of environmental interventions and because methodology for the adjustment has not been validated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary drinking water supply and sanitation facilities</HEADING>
<P>The primary drinking water supply before the intervention was 'unimproved' in 30 studies, 'improved' in 15 studies, and 'unclear' or unreported in five studies. Sanitation facilities in trial settings were 'improved' in 12 studies, 'unimproved' in 15 studies, and 'unclear' or unreported in 19 studies. Access to a water source was deemed 'sufficient' in 14 studies, 'insufficient' in four studies, and 'unclear' or unreported in the remaining studies. The quantity of water available to study participants was considered 'sufficient' in eight studies, 'insufficient' in four studies, and 'unclear' in 43 studies.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies measured water quality before the introduction of the intervention as an indication of the ambient risk and the microbiological quality of the water consumed by the control group. Details on the indicators used varied among the studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Thirty-five studies measured colony-forming units (CFUs) of thermotolerant coliforms, faecal coliforms, or <I>E. coli</I>, reporting geometric means, arithmetic means, number of CFUs/100 mL, mean faecal coliforms/100 mL, <I>E. coli </I>most probable number, median<I>, </I>or log<SUB>10</SUB>CFUs/100 mL. Other studies measured the frequency of samples containing such bacteria, or the CFU of total coliforms or other indicators of microbial contamination. None continually measured the microbiological performance of their interventions against the full range of bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens known to cause diarrhoea.</P>
<P>Eight studies did not report actually having measured microbiological water quality at all (<LINK REF="STD-Alam-1989-BGD" TYPE="STUDY">Alam 1989 BGD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1997-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1997 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luby 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00e4_usezhal-2009-BOL" TYPE="STUDY">Mäusezhal 2009 BOL</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opryszko-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opryszko 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majuru-2011-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">Majuru 2011 ZAF</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-2011-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 2011 AUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindquist-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindquist 2014</LINK>). Thus, it cannot be concluded definitively that the interventions investigated in these studies actually resulted in an improvement in drinking water quality.</P>

<P>Eight studies evaluated source-based interventions: improved wells or boreholes (<LINK REF="STD-Alam-1989-BGD" TYPE="STUDY">Alam 1989 BGD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1997-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1997 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Opryszko-2010b-AFG" TYPE="STUDY">Opryszko 2010b AFG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Opryszko-2010c-AFG" TYPE="STUDY">Opryszko 2010c AFG</LINK>) or improved community sources and distribution to public tap stands (<LINK REF="STD-Torun-1982-GTM" TYPE="STUDY">Torun 1982 GTM</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasana-2002-RWA" TYPE="STUDY">Gasana 2002 RWA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2003-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2003 PAK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2011-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2011 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majuru-2011-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">Majuru 2011 ZAF</LINK>); none evaluated reliable piped-in household connections.</P>
<P>Fourty-seven studies evaluated POU interventions: chlorination (17 studies), filtration (20 studies), combined flocculation and disinfection (five studies), SODIS solar disinfection (six studies), combination UV disinfection and filtration (one study), and improved storage (two studies). Significantly, there were no eligible studies that investigated the impact of boiling, even though that is by far the most common type of POU water treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rosa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosa 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many studies provided a supplementary hygiene education or instruction beyond the use of the intervention itself, and among POU interventions the primary intervention was often combined with some form of improved storage. In only three multiple-intervention arm studies did study authors establish different intervention groups with and without hygiene or other non-water improvement steps in order to isolate the impact of water quality (<LINK REF="REF-URL-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">URL 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opryszko-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opryszko 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindquist-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindquist 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Except in blinded trials involving placebos, control arms generally continued to use their pre-trial water supply and treatment practices. In one trial of POU chlorination plus a safe storage container, however, control households also received the container (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2010-GHA" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2010 GHA</LINK>). In two of the solar disinfection studies (<LINK REF="STD-Conroy-1996-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Conroy 1996 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conroy-1999-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Conroy 1999 KEN</LINK>) both intervention and control households received plastic bottles for storing their drinking water. The intervention group was instructed to place the bottles on roofs to expose them to the sun, while the control group was told to keep the filled bottles indoors. It is important to note that since improved storage even in the absence of treatment has been shown to improve microbial water quality (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2004</LINK>), the comparison between the intervention and control in these studies may understate the effectiveness of the intervention when compared to the controls following customary water handling practices.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adherence with the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Studies of source water interventions tended to assume adherence based on the fact that the primary water supply had been improved. Some studies of POU water treatment undertook indirect assessments of adherence by measuring residual chlorine levels in stored water, comparing microbiological water quality of intervention and control groups, conducting periodic or post-study surveys, or counting the amount of intervention product used. Most other studies measured adherence only by occasional observation, while eight cluster-RCTs did not report on adherence.</P>
<P>The studies of chlorine residuals reported adherence ranging from a high of 95% (<LINK REF="STD-Doocy-2006-LBR" TYPE="STUDY">Doocy 2006 LBR</LINK>) to a low of 11% (<LINK REF="STD-Opryszko-2010a-AFG" TYPE="STUDY">Opryszko 2010a AFG</LINK>). Even among these studies, however, investigators acknowledged that it was not possible to know to what extent intervention group participants actually consumed treated water or avoided consuming untreated water. For those studies that reported on adherence, three took the additional step of investigating and reporting on continued consumption of untreated water (<LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2010-DRC" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2010 DRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peletz-2012-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Peletz 2012 ZMB</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2013-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2013 IND</LINK>) a source of exposure that could be masked by less direct metrics of adherence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The studies' main outcome measure was diarrhoeal disease, but different methods were used to define, assess, and report this. Thirty-six studies used the WHO's definition of diarrhoea, while other studies used the following definitions: the mother's or respondent's definition (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasana-2002-RWA" TYPE="STUDY">Gasana 2002 RWA</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crump-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiller-2006-GTM" TYPE="STUDY">Chiller 2006 GTM</LINK>); 'watery diarrhoea as a component of gastroenteritis' (<LINK REF="STD-Colford-2002-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2002 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colford-2005-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2005 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colford-2009-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2009 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-2011-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 2011 AUS</LINK>); the local term (<LINK REF="STD-Conroy-1996-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Conroy 1996 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conroy-1999-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Conroy 1999 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2009-ETH" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2009 ETH</LINK>); "significant change in bowel habits towards decreased consistency or increased frequency" (<LINK REF="STD-Kirchhoff-1985-BRA" TYPE="STUDY">Kirchhoff 1985 BRA</LINK>); or dysentery (<LINK REF="STD-du-Preez-2010-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">du Preez 2010 ZAF</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-du-Preez-2011-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">du Preez 2011 KEN</LINK>). Four studies did not report the case definition used for diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Torun-1982-GTM" TYPE="STUDY">Torun 1982 GTM</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1997-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1997 CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-G_x00fc_nther-2013-BEN" TYPE="STUDY">Günther 2013 BEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindquist-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindquist 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The method of diarrhoea surveillance and assessment also varied. In most cases, participants were visited on a periodic basis, either weekly (19 studies), fortnightly (16 studies), or more infrequently (14 studies). Participants were asked to recall and report on cases of diarrhoea during a previous period, usually seven days (30 studies) or 14 days (six studies), with four studies having recall periods of one to four days and one trial having a recall period of four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-G_x00fc_nther-2013-BEN" TYPE="STUDY">Günther 2013 BEN</LINK>). Twelve studies asked each participant or a designated householder to keep a log or record to indicate days with or without diarrhoea, one procured data on diarrhoea from family records and disease registries (<LINK REF="STD-Mahfouz-1995-KSA" TYPE="STUDY">Mahfouz 1995 KSA</LINK>), or used paediatricians to assess the participants during regular medical checkups (<LINK REF="STD-Gasana-2002-RWA" TYPE="STUDY">Gasana 2002 RWA</LINK>). Only one trial did not report the method (<LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1997-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1997 CHN</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using these data, study authors reported diarrhoeal disease using one or more of the following epidemiological measures of disease frequency: incidence (34 studies); period prevalence (12 studies); and longitudinal prevalence (nine studies). The studies also reported other measures of disease, including incidence of persistent diarrhoea, gastrointestinal illness, including specific symptoms thereof, incidence or prevalence of bloody diarrhoea, and days of work or school lost due to diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Lule-2005-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Lule 2005 UGA</LINK>). Seven studies also reported on mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colford-2009-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2009 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2010-DRC" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2010 DRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-du-Preez-2011-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">du Preez 2011 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2011-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2011 KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peletz-2012-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Peletz 2012 ZMB</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2013-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2013 IND</LINK>). None reported adverse events.</P>
<P>None of these studies were primarily designed to investigate the impact of the intervention on death, and as such most were underpowered to evaluate this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data presentation</HEADING>
<P>Forty-three studies presented results both for children aged under five years (or a subgroup thereof) and for all ages or older age groups, three presented results only for adults, and nine presented results only for children under five years (or a subgroup thereof). Most of the studies adjusted raw data to account for possible covariates, including age, sex, sanitation or hygiene practices, area of residence, household income or proxies thereof, education or maternal literacy, age and occupation of the head of household, number of participants in the household or absent there from, baseline diarrhoea or conditions at baseline, or other variables associated with the household environment and participant behaviour.</P>
<P>Most studies of interventions at the POU also used statistical methods to adjust their results, either for repeated episodes of diarrhoea by the same participant or for clustering within the household, village or both. The studies that did not adjust for clustering may receive excess weight in meta-analysis due to artificial precision (<LINK REF="STD-Kirchhoff-1985-BRA" TYPE="STUDY">Kirchhoff 1985 BRA</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahfouz-1995-KSA" TYPE="STUDY">Mahfouz 1995 KSA</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-URL-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">URL 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 1: Any water quality intervention versus no intervention</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diarrhoea episodes</HEADING>
<P>An overall pooled analysis, across different trial designs, interventions and settings, finds the risk of diarrhoea to be lower with any water quality intervention compared to no intervention, both among all ages (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.69, 81215 participants; 52 studies <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), and under fives (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75 <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, as would be expected given the diverse nature of the trials, statistical heterogeneity between trials is very high (I² statistic = 98% and 97%, respectively). Our primary analysis is therefore stratified by the specific intervention type (for example, interventions at water source, POU chlorination, POU filtration), and by study design (for example, cluster-RCT, quasi-RCT, CBAs).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Only nine studies reported any deaths among study participants. Five reported the number of deaths in each study arm without differences evident (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Two studies reported the total number of deaths without stating how many occurred in each group (<LINK REF="STD-du-Preez-2010-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">du Preez 2010 ZAF</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2013-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2013 IND</LINK>), and two reported recording deaths but the numbers were not presented in the papers (<LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2009-ETH" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2009 ETH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremer-2011-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Kremer 2011 KEN</LINK>).</P>

<P>No trial reported adverse events from the interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 2: Interventions at the water source</HEADING>
<P>One cluster-RCT and five CBA studies evaluated interventions at the water source (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). All but one study were from settings with 'unimproved' water sources (unprotected wells or surface water), and all had unclear levels of sanitation. Three studies evaluated improved wells or boreholes, two evaluated chlorination or filtration of community water sources, and one evaluated an improved community piped supply. No studies evaluated reliable household connections to a clean water source (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for a description of study settings and interventions).</P>
<P>The single cluster-RCT from Afghanistan reported no statistically significant difference in diarrhoea with improved wells compared to no intervention (one trial, 3266 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The CBA studies evaluated different interventions, had variable findings, and were all at unclear risk of multiple sources of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Three of the five studies reported statistically significant effects on diarrhoea (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>): in Bangladesh, provision of one hand pump per four to six households (three times as many as control areas) was associated with a small reduction in diarrhoea over three-years follow-up (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97); in remote areas in South Africa a new community piped water supply was associated with around a 50% reduction in diarrhoea compared to untreated river water (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77); and in China structural well improvements were also associated with around a 50% reduction in diarrhoea (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.47). In contrast, chlorination and filtration of community water supplies were not associated with positive benefits in Rwanda and Pakistan respectively. Overall, the body of evidence is judged to be of very low quality (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Given the variability in interventions, further subgroup analyses to try to understand the heterogeneity were not useful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 3. POU chlorination</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen cluster-RCTs, with 16 comparisons, evaluated POU chlorination versus control. Chlorine was delivered to households free of charge every one to four weeks, with instructions on how to use it, and in eight trials a water storage container was also provided (see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> for a description of study settings and interventions).</P>
<P>On average, POU chlorination in cluster RCTs reduced the risk of diarrhoea episodes by around a quarter, both for all ages (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) and for children under five years of age (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.92; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect which was not well explained by a series of subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>As might be expected from an effective intervention, the trials finding larger effects from chlorination tended to be those where adherence with the intervention was higher (as measured by residual chlorine) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), but in the four trials which had adequate blinding no effects of water chlorination were seen (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). A subgroup analysis looking at interventions with and without the provision of water storage containers did not find statistical evidence of subgroup differences (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). Effects were seen in trials with 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up, but no effect was demonstrated in the two trials with follow-up longer than 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>). The funnel plot for this comparison has some asymmetry which may be the result of publication bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The overall quality of the evidence was therefore judged to be low (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>An additional two CBA studies evaluated POU chlorination but only provide very low quality evidence of any effect (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 4. POU combined flocculation and disinfection</HEADING>
<P>Five cluster-RCTs from low-income settings evaluated interventions where sachets of flocculant and disinfectant were distributed to households to treat water from unimproved sources (three trials), improved sources (one trial), and unclear sources (one trial). Four trials also provided water containers and mixing equipment (see <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK> for a description of study settings and interventions). None of the trials blinded the outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Four of the five trials found statistically significant reductions in diarrhoea with the intervention (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>), but statistical heterogeneity in the size of this effect made pooling the data difficult (I² statistic = 99%; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). This heterogeneity relates to one trial from Liberia IDP camps, <LINK REF="STD-Doocy-2006-LBR" TYPE="STUDY">Doocy 2006 LBR</LINK>, where the flocculation and disinfection kits reduced diarrhoea by 88% (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.13; one trial, 2191 participants). Exclusion of this potential outlier finds a more modest effect with the other four trials both for all ages (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82; four trials, 11788 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>) and for children under five years of age (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adherence with the intervention, as measured by residual chlorine, was generally low (&lt; 50%), but higher in the trial from Liberia showing large effects (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). Larger effects tended to also be seen in the trials also providing water storage containers (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). The effects were present in trials with both improved and unimproved water source and sanitation (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>). None of the trials had follow-up longer than 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 5. POU filtration</HEADING>
<P>Overall 20 cluster-RCTs evaluated POU filtration: ceramic filtration (nine trials), biosand filtration (five trials), LifeStraw® filters (three trials), and plumbed-in filtration (three trials) (see <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> for a description of study settings and interventions).</P>
<P>On average, POU filtration technologies reduced diarrhoea by around a half, both for all ages (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59; 18 trials, 15,582 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>) and for children under five years of age (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.62; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). However, the number of trials and the quality of evidence was different for each specific intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). The lack of blinding in these studies is a major concern: of the five trials with adequate blinding only one found a statistically significant effect (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>). The quality of evidence was therefore downgraded for all types of filters due to risk of bias (<LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>).</P>
<P>POU ceramic filters reduced diarrhoea by around 60% in nine trials mainly from low- or middle-income countries, regardless of whether the water source or sanitation was classified as improved or unimproved (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.53, eight trials, 5763 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Similarly, biosand filtration reduced diarrhoea by around a half consistently across five trials from low- or middle-income settings, again regardless of whether the water source or sanitation was improved or unimproved (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57, four trials, 5504 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>On average, the use of LifeStraw® filters reduced diarrhoea by around a third in three trials from low-income settings with unimproved water sources (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Plumbed-in filtration has only been evaluated in high-income settings (USA). There is a modest effect in all three trials, although only one reaches standard levels of statistical significance. The overall meta-analysis has similar effect sizes with both fixed effects and random effects models, but wider confidence intervals with random effects (Fixed-effects: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94; Random-effects: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03; three trials, 1056 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Adherence with the filtration systems was reported by 14 trials, of which eight assessed this by self-reported use which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding. Adherence was generally reported as high, and larger effects were apparent in trials with higher adherence (<LINK REF="CMP-005.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.8</LINK>). A subgroup analysis looking at filtration interventions with and without the provision of water storage containers (excluding the trials evaluating plumbed in filtration), found larger effects in the nine trials providing containers (<LINK REF="CMP-005.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.9</LINK>). Effects were seen in trials with 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up, but no effect was demonstrated in the one trial with follow-up longer than 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-005.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.10</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 6. POU solar disinfection (SODIS)</HEADING>
<P>Four cluster-RCTs and two quasi-RCTs evaluated solar disinfection of water from improved sources (one study) and unimproved sources (five studies) in low-income settings. Plastic bottles were distributed to households with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking (see <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK> for a description of study settings and interventions).</P>
<P>Overall in the cluster-RCTs, solar disinfection reduced diarrhoea by around a third for all ages (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>), and almost a half in children under five years of age (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). The largest effect was seen in the trial with the highest adherence (<LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>). The quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate due to the lack of blinding and the inherent risk of bias (<LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the quasi-RCTs the observed effect was lower (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.97; two trials, 555 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-05 15:20:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to know if source-based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (<I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The distribution and promotion of point-of-use water chlorination products may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Similarly, distribution and promotion of flocculation and disinfection sachets probably reduces diarrhoea but had highly variable effects (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Point-of-use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). This reduction was apparent for ceramic filters, biosand systems and LifeStraw® filters, but plumbed in filtration has only been evaluated in high- income settings and a statistically significant effect has not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>In low-income settings, distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking (SODIS) probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-13 12:31:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, of which most studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries (50 studies), with unimproved water sources (30 studies), and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies).</P>
<P>For water source interventions, there are simply too few studies to make conclusions about what may or may not be effective in different settings. While protective effects were seen in some individual trials, it is unclear whether these effects could be expected to be reproducible in other settings, and all of the trials had multiple potential sources of bias. Significantly, we found no studies evaluating reliable, piped-in water supplies.</P>
<P>In contrast, some POU interventions do appear to be broadly protective against diarrhoea across many settings regardless of whether water sources and sanitation are 'improved' or 'unimproved'. This finding affirms the current strategy of the WHO and UNICEF to promote POU water treatment and safe storage, even though this will not increase the number of households with access to improved water supplies and therefore will not contribute towards achieving current international water targets (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The effectiveness of POU interventions in settings without improved sanitation contradicts earlier findings that interventions to improve water quality are effective only where sanitation has already been addressed (<LINK REF="REF-Esrey-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esrey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanDerslice-1995" TYPE="STUDY">VanDerslice 1995</LINK>), or that environmental interventions to prevent diarrhoea are effective only by employing an integrated approach (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although we provide average estimates of effect for each individual POU intervention, we recommend caution in using these estimates to conclude the superiority of one intervention over another. Such an observational analysis would be highly susceptible to confounding by study setting and population, and may not represent true differences in the size of the effects. Head-to-head trials would be necessary to reliably conclude superiority and these were not the focus of this review.</P>
<P>As few studies continued follow-up beyond 12 months, we are unable to comment reliably on the long-term sustainability of these effects. While pooled estimates of studies with follow-up periods under 12 months were generally protective, those with follow-up periods in excess of 12 months were not.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-13 09:46:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence for the effects of the individual interventions on diarrhoea ranged from moderate (for ceramic filters and biosand filtration), to low (for distribution of chlorination kits, flocculation and disinfection sachets, and LifeStraw® filters), to very low (for water source improvements).</P>
<P>The primary reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was the risk of bias inherent in unblinded studies evaluating the efficacy of an intervention on a self-reported outcome. Notably, only one of the nine blinded trials reported a statistically significant protective effect, but this observation may be explained by other confounding factors present in these nine trials (see <LINK REF="TBL-24" TYPE="TABLE">Table 24</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>Four studies were conducted in high-income countries where the water was of good microbiological quality even in the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Colford-2002-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2002 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colford-2005-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2005 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colford-2009-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Colford 2009 USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-2011-AUS" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 2011 AUS</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>One further trial from Ghana found very low levels of faecal contamination of water supplies in the control group which were likely to present only minimal risk (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2010-GHA" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2010 GHA</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Three studies had either low adherence with the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2013-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2013 IND</LINK>), or very high reported use of drinking untreated water from other sources (<LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2010-DRC" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2010 DRC</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Two studies employed control interventions which may have improved water quality: <LINK REF="STD-Boisson-2010-DRC" TYPE="STUDY">Boisson 2010 DRC</LINK> employed a "placebo" that actually removed one log (90%) of faecal indicator bacteria and <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2010-GHA" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2010 GHA</LINK> provided control households with safe storage.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The second common reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was unexplained heterogeneity. For some of the POU interventions, the protective effect varied considerably across studies. Some of this variability could be explained by adherence with the intervention, with larger effects in studies with higher adherence, but some variability remained which we were unable to explain despite multiple subgroup analyses. This is likely to reflect important underlying clinical heterogeneity: the aetiology and epidemiology of diarrhoea is complex and variable, transmission pathways are multiple, and even the portion of diarrhoea that is waterborne is not well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was also some evidence of possible publication bias in the trials evaluating home chlorination but this was not strong enough to further downgrade the quality of evidence.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-18 19:48:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of the included studies had multiple intervention arms comparing two or more intervention groups against a single control group. In some analyses, we included multiple comparisons from the same trial which double counts the control group participants and yields results in the meta-analysis that are artificially precise. However, this bias is unlikely to have significantly impacted the overall quality of evidence or conclusions.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:21:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results are generally consistent with the prior version of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Clasen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clasen 2006</LINK>) and with other reviews of water quality interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddington-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddington 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cairncross-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairncross 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>One additional review of water quality interventions reports no effect with POU interventions once blinding is taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Engell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engell 2013</LINK>). While we share the concerns about the lack of blinding in many of these trials (and have downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly), and also found no effect in any of the trials with adequate blinding, we have identified several possible confounders in this observation (discussed above), and retain low to moderate confidence that these interventions are effective.</P>
<P>Although we found no controlled trials evaluating piped-in water supplies, a recent review that also included some observational studies reported some evidence of a protective effect with this intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The finding of larger effects with increased adherence is consistent with modelling data based on quantitative microbial risk assessment which suggest a dose-response association between water quality and diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enger 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-18 21:14:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rigorously conducted RCTs that compare various approaches to improving drinking water quality will help clarify the potential for water quality interventions to prevent endemic diarrhoea. It is particularly important that such trials be designed to minimize reporting bias, such as through the use of objective outcomes.</P>
<P>Among source-based interventions, there is a need for studies to assess household connections and other approaches (such as chlorination at the point of delivery) that are more likely to ensure safe drinking water from source through to the POU.</P>
<P>There is also a need for longer-term studies in programmatic settings on approaches to optimise the coverage and long-term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations.</P>

<LI>Water quality: Storage vessel and chlorine tablets.</LI>
<LI>Sanitation: a) a sani-scoop hoe dedicated to the removal of human and animal faeces from the compound, b) plastic child potties for children ages 6 months and older until they are using the latrine, and c) a new or upgraded dual pit latrine for each household in the compound. The behavior change components of the intervention will emphasize the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of faeces in the compound courtyard to prevent contact with young children.</LI>
<LI>Handwashing: The hardware components of the Bangladesh handwashing intervention include two handwashing stations. The first station will be located in the kitchen (location of food preparation), and will include a 16 L bucket with a tap fitting, a stool, bowl and soapy water bottle. The second station will be located near the toilet, and will include a 40 L bucket with tap fitting, stool, bowl and soapy water bottle. The study will provide detergent soap to families free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention will focus messaging for handwashing at two critical times: after defecation and before food preparation.</LI>
<LI>Nutrition: Mothers will be encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reach 6 months of age, mothers will be encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and will receive education about supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from <A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Final_IYCF_programming_guide_2011.pdf">Unicef</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/documents/a85622/">WHO</A>. From ages 6 to 24 months, study children will receive a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested through the <A HREF="http://www.ilins.org/">iLiNS</A> project.</LI>

<LI>Water quality: intervention villages will receive chlorine dispensers at spring water sources. After filling their plastic jerry can of water from the source, users can place the jerry can under the dispenser, and turn a knob to release 3 mL of chlorine. Behavior change messages will focus on the consistent provision of treated water to all children living in the household.</LI>
<LI>Sanitation: a) a sani-scoop hoe dedicated to the removal of human and animal faeces from the compound; b) plastic child potties for children ages 6 months and older until they are using the latrine; and c) a new or upgraded pit latrine for each household in the compound. If participants have a latrine, its structure will be improved if necessary. Plastic slabs will be installed to improve mud or wood floors, and the intervention delivery team will make sure that all latrine structures have walls, doors, roofs that ensure safety and privacy. The behaviour change components of the intervention will emphasize the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of faeces in the compound courtyard to prevent contact with young children.</LI>
<LI>Handwashing: two handwashing stations in the compound of each respondent, one near the latrine, and one by the cooking area. The handwashing stations are constructed from locally available materials and are of a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to 5 L jerry cans of clean water and jugs of soapy water. The behavior change component of the intervention will focus messaging for handwashing at two critical times: after defecation and before food preparation.</LI>
<LI>Nutrition: mothers will be encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through to 6 months of age. When newborns reach 6 months of age, mothers will be encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and will receive education about supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from <A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Final_IYCF_programming_guide_2011.pdf">Unicef</A> and <A HREF="http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/documents/a85622/">WHO</A>.

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: the outcome was measured as self-reported episodes of diarrhoea, and is susceptible to bias as most studies were unblinded.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: statistical heterogeneity was very high with six out of fourteen trials having point estimates close to no effect. A subgroup analysis by adherence with the intervention (assessed by measurements of residual chlorine in drinking water) found larger effects in the studies with better adherence but the results remained inconsistent.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious indirectness: these studies are mainly from low- and middle-income countries, in settings with both improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious imprecision: The analysis is adequately powered to detect this effect.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>No serious inconsistency: The evidence of benefit is consistent across trials, but there is substantial statistical heterogeneity in the size of the effect.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> This analysis excludes one additional study which found a much larger effect than seen in the other four trials and was considered an outlier (<LINK REF="STD-Doocy-2006-LBR" TYPE="STUDY">Doocy 2006 LBR</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: as diarrhoea episodes were reported by participants this outcome is susceptible to bias from lack of blinding. None of these studies blinded participants and outcome assessors to the treatment allocation.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious inconsistency.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for serious indirectness: this single RCT from Afghanistan evaluated the provision of protected wells. It is not possible to make broad generalizations to other settings.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: statistical heterogeneity was very high (I² statistic = 98%), such that the data could not be pooled. Some large and statistically significant effects were seen in some individual trials, but not others.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: these studies are from a variety of low- and middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Rwanda, Pakistan, South Africa, China). However, as only single trials evaluated each intervention it is not possible to make broad generalizations.<BR/>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: as diarrhoea episodes were reported by participants this outcome is susceptible to bias from lack of blinding. Only two of these studies blinded participants and outcome assessors to the treatment allocation, and these two studies found no evidence of an effect with chlorination.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: statistical heterogeneity was very high (I² statistic = 91%). In a subgroup analysis by compliance with the intervention (assessed by measurements of residual chlorine in drinking water) found larger effects in the studies with better compliance.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious indirectness: these studies are mainly from low- and middle-income countries (the Gambia, India, Kenya, Bangladesh, Ghana, Brazil, Pakistan,Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Uzbekistan). The interventions consisted of free distribution of chlorine (every one to four weeks) plus instructions on how to use it. In some cases, the intervention included hygiene education and storage containers in which to treat and store water.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious imprecision: the average effect suggests POU chlorination may reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a quarter. The analysis is adequately powered to detect this effect.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: as diarrhoea episodes were reported by participants this outcome is susceptible to bias from lack of blinding. None of these studies blinded participants and outcome assessors to the treatment allocation.<BR/>

<P>The assumed risk is based on 2.9 episodes/child year in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-Walker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer Walker 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: as diarrhoea episodes were reported by participants this outcome is susceptible to bias from lack of blinding. None of these studies blinded participants and outcome assessors to the treatment allocation.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious inconsistency: In the complete analysis of five trials statistical heterogeneity was very high (I² statistic = 99%). However, this heterogeneity was related to a single trial showing very large effects conducted in an emergency setting in Liberia possibly due to epidemic diarrhoea. When this trial was removed as an outlier, there was a smaller, but more consistent effect. <BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious indirectness: the studies were conducted in rural areas in Guatemala (two studies), and Kenya (one study), one trial was from a camp for displaced persons in Liberia and one from squatter settlements in Pakistan. Sanitation was improved in only one of these studies.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious imprecision: all five studies found benefits with flocculation. The 95% CI of the pooled effect includes the possibility of no effect, but this imprecision is a result of the heterogeneity between studies.<BR/>
