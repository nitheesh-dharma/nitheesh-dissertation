<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Not enough evidence on effectiveness of the drug albendazole, alone or in combination, for killing or interrupting transmission of threadlike worms that cause lymphatic filariasis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Filariasis affects about 120 million people in more than 80 countries and is spread by mosquitoes. Adult worms take up residence in lymph channels and when paired, produce larvae that circulate in the blood. The adult worms can live in the lymph system for five years or more. The infection can cause severe disability, due to massive enlargement of limbs, genitals, and breasts. On the other hand, many infected people have no symptoms, but do contribute to the perpetuation of the infection in the community. This review of trials found insufficient evidence to say whether a single dose of the drug albendazole kills the worms, or whether, if given in combination with diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin, it enhances the killing of these worms or the larvae they produce.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Mass treatment with albendazole co-administered with another antifilarial drug is part of a global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. We sought reliable evidence of the effects of albendazole on the disease and the parasite. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To summarize the effects of albendazole alone or in combination with antifilarial drugs for clinical treatment and community control of lymphatic filariasis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (August 2005), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (1974 to August 2005), LILACS (1982 to August 2005), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers, the World Health Organization, and GlaxoSmithKline. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of albendazole alone or combined with another antifilarial drug for treating individuals with lymphatic filariasis, or for reducing transmission in endemic communities. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Authors contacted investigators for missing information or clarification. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-05 15:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven trials including 6997 participants (995 with detectable microfilariae) met the criteria. A comparison of albendazole and placebo detected no effect on microfilariae prevalence (920 participants; 3 trials); one trial (499 participants) reported significantly lower microfilariae density at six months. Albendazole performed slightly worse than ivermectin in two trials (436 participants). Compared with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), two small trials (56 participants) found little difference in microfilariae prevalence over an extended follow up. One larger trial (502 participants) found a statistically significant effect for DEC at six months, but none at three months.</P>
<P>Microfilariae prevalence and density were statistically significantly lower with the combination of albendazole and ivermectin compared with ivermectin alone in two of three trials (649 participants). Two trials compared albendazole plus DEC with DEC alone and found no statistically significant difference in microfilariae prevalence, though one trial favoured the combination at six months (risk ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.21; 491 participants). This trial also found a statistically significant reduction in microfilariae density.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute that albendazole co-administered with DEC or ivermectin is more effective than DEC or ivermectin alone in clearing microfilariae or killing adult worms. Albendazole combined with ivermectin appears to have a small effect on microfilaraemia, but this was not consistently demonstrated. The effect of albendazole against adult and larval filarial parasites, alone and in combination with other antifilarial drugs, deserves further rigorous research. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-14 13:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic infection of threadlike, filarial worms that affects about 120 million people in more than 80 countries (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Bancroftian filariasis, caused by infection with <I>Wuchereria bancrofti</I>, occurs in tropical regions of Asia, Africa, China, and the Pacific islands, and in parts of the Caribbean and South America. Brugian filariasis is less common, with <I>Brugia malayi </I>occurring in parts of Asia, and <I>Brugia timori</I> in Indonesia (<LINK REF="REF-FGN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FGN 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Filariasis is transmitted by mosquitoes from a number of genera (including <I>Culex, Anopheles, Mansonia, Ochlerotatus, </I>and <I>Aedes</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Burkot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkot 2002</LINK>). Female mosquitoes transmit the disease. They are infected when they take blood meals from people with microfilariae (mf), early stage larvae. The larvae develop for about 12 to 15 days in the mosquito to a mature larval stage (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>). When the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal, the larvae enter the skin, migrate to the lymph vessels, and develop into adult worms, where male and female worms pair. They later produce mf, which migrate to the blood causing microfilaraemia. The time between being infected and adult worms producing microfilaraemia is estimated to be about 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>Microfilariae move in and out of circulating peripheral blood according to a daily cycle. In most species, mf levels peak during the night, between 10 pm to 4 am (<LINK REF="REF-Simonsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsen 1997</LINK>), a time when mosquito vectors are actively feeding. In Fiji, Polynesia, and the Philippines some strains of <I>Wuchereria bancrofti </I>mf peak during the day (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Many people with filariasis may be asymptomatic most of the time. However, even people without clinical symptoms often have lymphatic changes, including lymphangiectasia (widening of the lymphatic vessels) and thickening of the spermatic cord (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 2000</LINK>), which can be detected through imaging studies. Clinical symptoms and signs include hydrocoele (excess fluid inside the scrotal sac), lymphoedema (swelling and enlargement of affected areas of the body), and elephantiasis (long standing enlargement and swelling of the limbs, scrota, or breasts associated with skin thickening).</P>
<P>Historically, filarial infection has been diagnosed by examining a blood smear for mf, but, even if blood is taken at night, not all infections are detected because mf levels are very low in many people. Antigen assays, which became available for field use during the 1990s, are more sensitive and can be used for blood collected during the day or night (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1997</LINK>) because they indicate the presence of the adult worm and do not depend on the temporal presence of mf. Ultrasound imaging can demonstrate the presence of live adult worms (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>How the filarial worm causes disease is not well understood. The following have been proposed: adult worms living in and damaging lymph vessels; immunologic reactions to the presence and death of filarial worms; secondary infections of affected areas, which contribute significantly to both acute and chronic disease manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 2000</LINK>). Researchers have also suggested that toxins released by <I>Wolbachia </I>(endosymbiotic bacteria found within the cells of filarial worms) cause disease (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2001</LINK>). Some or all of these processes may be important.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Control</HEADING>
<P>Control strategies aim to reduce mf in the community to levels that prevent transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Ottesen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottesen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ottesen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottesen 1999</LINK>). Treatment of individuals with clinical disease is generally only partially effective (at least in part because there is no drug that reliably kills the 'macrofilariae', the adult worms). Mass drug administration programmes therefore aim for a sustainable reduction in community mf loads below a critical threshold or a complete clearance of mf to have an appreciable impact on transmission. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis recommends yearly, single-dose, two-drug regimens (albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine or albendazole plus ivermectin) for at least five years (corresponding to the reproductive lifespan of the adult worm) to prevent transmission. However, the critical threshold below which no further transmission will take place is unclear and may depend on the vector species in the locality. Some mosquitoes (eg <I>Aedes polynesiensis</I>, some culicine mosquitoes in India and the Americas) may be more efficient at lower mf densities (a process known as limitation). Higher treatment coverage for longer periods or other strategies such as vector control may be required in areas where these vectors are responsible for a high proportion of transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Burkot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkot 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pichon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichon 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) both kill mf. DEC may have some temporary sterilizing effects or actually kill adult worms, so one treatment with either drug can affect mf levels for many months. Reductions of 90% from pretreatment mf levels have been seen after a single dose of DEC or ivermectin even one year after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ottesen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottesen 1999</LINK>). The impact of drug treatment on transmission can be enhanced, if currently available antifilarial drugs demonstrate a killing or sterilizing effect on adult worms, in addition to their effect on mf. There are concerns that an over reliance on a limited range of drugs may eventually cause resistance, although there is little direct evidence that this is currently a problem in filariasis (<LINK REF="REF-Barat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barat 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been observed that some infected people lose their mf in the absence of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Vanamail-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanamail 1990</LINK>). However, overall mf prevalence rates are believed to be relatively stable over time in endemic communities in the absence of community treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Meyrowitsch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyrowitsch 1995</LINK>); new microfilaraemic infections replace those whose microfilaraemia subsides (<LINK REF="REF-Vanamail-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanamail 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weil-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1999</LINK>). Nevertheless, lymphatic filariasis has been eradicated using vector control methods from some areas such as the Solomon Islands, Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Burkot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkot 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pichon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichon 2002</LINK>), and parts of China using DEC-fortified salt and other DEC regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Gelband-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelband 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">DEC and ivermectin</HEADING>
<P>DEC has been in use for filariasis for more than 50 years. In the early years of control the recommended regimen for DEC was 6 mg/kg daily for 12 days (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1984</LINK>). Later, clinical and community trials determined that single doses given at various intervals &#8722; weekly, monthly, annually, and biannually &#8722; were equally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Andrade-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eberhard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eberhard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simonsen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsen 1995</LINK>). There is reasonable evidence from ultrasound and clinical observations that DEC kills some adult worms (macrofilariae) after single doses (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Figueredo_x002d_Silva-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueredo-Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noroes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noroes 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ivermectin is used for the treatment and community control of onchocerciasis (caused by another filarial worm, <I>Onchocerca volvulus</I>). It has also been effective in community control programs for lymphatic filariasis (<LINK REF="REF-Cao-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cao 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cartel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coutinho-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coutinho 1994</LINK>). It can be used in many places, but it is particularly important in areas where both onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis coexist because DEC can cause eye damage if given to individuals with onchocerciasis. However, recent ultrasound studies suggest that adult worms are not killed by ivermectin, even at high doses over a period of six months (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of antifilarial drugs can be serious (though almost never fatal) and prevent people from completing treatment. The most serious appear to be due to a host immunologic reaction to the dying worms (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1984</LINK>). These effects include fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, and blood in urine. Local effects include localized pain, tender nodules, lymphadenitis (inflammation of the lymph nodes), and lymphangitis (inflammation of lymph vessels) (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Albendazole</HEADING>
<P>Albendazole has been used widely to treat intestinal parasites since the late 1980s and may have a potential role in lymphatic filariasis control (<LINK REF="REF-Ottesen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottesen 1999</LINK>). A report from an informal consultation organised by the World Health Organization suggests that repeated high doses of albendazole have a killing or sterilizing effect on <I>W. bancrofti</I> adult worms (<LINK REF="REF-CDS_x002f_FIL-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDS/FIL 1998</LINK>). However, the data in the report are scanty and it remains unclear whether adding albendazole to either DEC or ivermectin improves cure, prevents further transmission, or influences the occurrence of adverse events. A narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Horton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horton 2000</LINK> from GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures albendazole, did not demonstrate that adding albendazole to either drug increased the frequency or severity of adverse events. GlaxoSmithKline states that albendazole does not have a role in morbidity management &#8722; it will not treat the symptoms in people already affected by filariasis (<LINK REF="REF-GlaxoSmithKline-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GlaxoSmithKline 2003</LINK>). But at least one trial has considered the effectiveness of albendazole in reducing both disease progression and incidence of new symptoms (such as hydrocoele) (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>). We therefore include this as a secondary outcome.</P>
<P>A recently published review concluded that co-administration of albendazole was more effective in reducing mf prevalence than one antifilarial drug alone (<LINK REF="REF-Gyapong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyapong 2005</LINK>). This review had included observational data and did not assess the quality of the studies, whilst our analysis included only higher quality randomized controlled trials. Most importantly, <LINK REF="REF-Gyapong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyapong 2005</LINK> incorporated data from several studies twice (by counting results at six and twelve months and combining them in the same meta-analysis), which artificially narrows the 95% confidence intervals. This resulted in the authors erroneously concluding that overall the effect was 'statistically significant' (<LINK REF="REF-Gyapong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyapong 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, we aim to summarize the evidence for the effects of albendazole alone or in combination with DEC or ivermectin in both the individual treatment and transmission control of lymphatic filariasis.</P>

<P>One author (HE or JC) extracted data, which a second author (PG) checked. Where trials reported the same outcomes in different ways, we attempted to contact the primary investigators for further information, which might allow transformation of data. We extracted data relating to trial and participant characteristics, and reported outcome measures. We intended to extract data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis (all the participants analysed according to the intervention to which they were originally allocated, whether they received it or not). This was not possible, but may be attempted in future updates. Where the numbers randomized and the numbers analysed for each outcome were inconsistent, we calculated the percentage loss to follow up and recorded this information in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, we extracted arithmetic means and standard deviations. Where geometric means were reported, we extracted and recorded this information. We also tried to extract confidence intervals or standard deviations on the log scale.

<P>Standard deviations or confidence intervals were not reported for mf density outcomes; this information was obtained from the investigators for <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>. As so few trials reported standard deviations, we could not pool results for changes in mf density; results quoted in this review are the original trial author's calculations.</P>
<P>Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Jayakody-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jayakody 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>, did not clearly describe the method of calculating reductions in geometric mean mf density, but <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK> provided further details on request. This trial calculated a William's mean (a modification of the geometric mean to take into account zero counts) (<LINK REF="REF-Basanez-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basanez 1994</LINK>) on the pretreatment and post-treatment mf densities. <LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK> calculated change in mf density by two methods the Williams mean and by using an 'area under the curve' analysis (an average density over the whole 12 month post-treatment period). <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK> calculated a William's mean and estimated the combined effect over the one-year follow-up period using repeated measures techniques (either ANOVA or generalized estimating equations). <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK> calculated the geometric mean mf density reduction by dividing the difference between densities before and after treatment by the pretreatment mf density and log transforming the results. If pretreatment mf density was less than the density after treatment, the reduction was deemed to be zero. The trialists performed this adjustment to eliminate the problem of log transforming a negative value, but this method may bias estimates of treatment effectiveness, as increases in mf density after treatment are set to zero. For this reason, for <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK>, we present the trialists' results in the text and the percentage change using the group means in tables. The <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK> trial authors recalculated geometric mean changes taking into account children where mf density increased post-treatment at our request (although estimates do not include children newly infected over the course of the trial), and we report these revised figures.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-14 13:49:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was designed to assess the effects of albendazole alone or in combination with the currently recommended antifilarial drugs, ivermectin or DEC. Although the review has considered the effects of albendazole alone, the main interest and strategy of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis is in the effectiveness of combinations of different antifilarial drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Ismail-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ismail 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenoy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shenoy 1999</LINK>). Of particular interest is the effectiveness of adding albendazole (thought to be macrofilaricidal) (<LINK REF="REF-CDS_x002f_FIL-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDS/FIL 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayakody-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jayakody 1993</LINK>) to single dose regimens of ivermectin (thought to be mainly microfilaricidal) or DEC (possibly both microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal) (<LINK REF="REF-Ottesen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottesen 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included studies were designed primarily to assess the effectiveness of albendazole for treatment of individuals, and none have explicitly considered its effects on transmission in whole communities. We identified seven trials, but most of these were small. All were described as randomized, but they had important limitations. In particular, the numbers of participants lost to follow up were very high (above 20%) in all trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>, and this may lead to imbalances in the comparison groups.</P>
<P>Differences in design (mf positive only versus positive and negative participants at baseline, variable outcome measurement and reporting, and follow-up times) make it difficult to compare the trials. In particular, some trials reported outcomes mainly for those who were mf positive at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kshirsagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kshirsagar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>). Outcomes for all participants in the trial, regardless of baseline mf status, are essential in assessing the community impact of mass treatment strategies. Most of the trials reported changes in antigenaemia prevalence or density in addition to mf prevalence and density (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kshirsagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kshirsagar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>). There was broad agreement between changes in both these outcome measures in these trials. Only two trials objectively examined the effects of antifilarial medication on the viability of adult worms: <LINK REF="STD-Kshirsagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kshirsagar 2004</LINK> used a sample of the enrolled participants (101 men at baseline) and <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK> used 25 men at baseline. Adult worms are responsible for the production of mf; therefore, the extent to which antifilarial drugs affect worm viability is an important outcome.</P>
<P>Albendazole alone was not effective in reducing mf prevalence (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>) or circulating filarial antigens (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>) compared with placebo. Ivermectin was more effective than albendazole in both of these trials, and a meta-analysis indicates a marginal but statistically significant 16% reduction in the risk ratio of mf prevalence after treatment for those who were mf positive at baseline in favour of ivermectin.</P>
<P>In two trials the combination of albendazole and ivermectin was better than ivermectin alone in the short term (after four to six months follow up; <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>), but they were the same after twelve months of follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>). The lack of measurements at similar intervals in all three trials makes it impossible to know if the results were substantially alike. It is possible that by 12 months mf levels had risen sufficiently to dampen the actual effect of the drugs in <LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>, but this cannot explain the lack of effect in <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>. The dose of ivermectin was also higher in the Haiti study (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK>) than the other two trials. The trials used different techniques to assess mf: investigators in Haiti used the thick film method in 20 無 of blood and measurement at night; in both <LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK> the counting chamber method in 100 無 of blood was used, with measurement during the day (<LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>) or at night (<LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two very small trials in mf positive individuals and one larger population-based trial compared albendazole with DEC (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayakody-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jayakody 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>). The two small trials found no statistically significant differences in mf prevalence or density at any of the time points measured. <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK> found a statistically significant reduction in mf prevalence in favour of DEC at six months, but no difference at three months.</P>
<P>Three trials also compared albendazole and DEC with both drugs co-administered. The two small trials from India, <LINK REF="STD-Kshirsagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kshirsagar 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>, showed no statistically significant differences at any time point up to two years follow up between DEC alone and albendazole plus DEC. <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK> found a reduction in mf prevalence favouring the combination at six months, but this was not statistically significant. There was no difference between the combination and DEC alone at three months. None of the three trials demonstrated any differences in antigen prevalence between the combination and DEC alone. However, one of the three trials, <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>, did find a statistically significant reduction in geometric mean mf density at six months in favour of the combination (although there was no statistically significant difference in mf density at three months or antigen density at six months).</P>
<P>Although all trials provided data on geometric mean mf density, a lack of reporting of standard deviations or confidence intervals from most trials made it impossible to include these results in a meta-analysis. A reduction in mf geometric mean density was observed for all treatments including placebo, and the reduction appeared greater for active treatments (albendazole, DEC, and ivermectin), but tests of statistical significance were not always carried out or reported.</P>
<P>The effect of treatment on clinical disease was not remarkable in any of the comparison groups. This is not surprising as effect sizes for clinical outcomes were small and the trials were not powered to detect small clinical benefits.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events were observed in six of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunyo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunyo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kshirsagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kshirsagar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simonsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsen 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jayakody-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jayakody 1993</LINK> found a very high incidence of "scrotal syndrome" among those treated with albendazole, but the doses of both albendazole and DEC were very much higher than in the other trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-05 15:13:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on limited data, the evidence suggests that albendazole when used alone is not better than placebo, ivermectin, or DEC in clearing blood microfilariae. Results from trials that compared albendazole plus ivermectin with ivermectin alone were inconsistent, although two of three showed a reduction in mf density. Two small trials found little difference in albendazole co-administered with DEC compared with DEC alone, but one larger trial tended to favour the combination at six months, with a significant reduction in mf density. Most trials were underpowered to assess the effects of albendazole, alone or in combination, on morbidity or adverse events. Only larger scale studies can determine if any effect is of practical importance. </P>
<P>The conclusions of this review are based on trials that have randomized and treated individuals, therefore they should be cautiously extrapolated to large-scale, population-based mass drug administration programmes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-05 15:13:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only limited data were found &#8722; further large well-designed trials are required in several areas including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the effectiveness of albendazole in combination with DEC or ivermectin on treatment and control of lymphatic filariasis;</LI>
<LI>the impact of albendazole in mass drug administration campaigns; and</LI>
<LI>studies of other interventions (against the parasite or the vector) to augment mass drug administration.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The complete clearance of blood mf (or reduction to levels below which transmission is unlikely) theoretically represents the most reliable strategy for interrupting transmission. But this may be difficult to achieve in practice, as ivermectin mainly acts on mf with no demonstrable macrofilaricidal activity. A drug that kills both mf and adults would clearly be ideal, and there is an argument for more research and development towards such a drug. Studies of potential macrofilaricides could be assessed objectively, as with ultrasound detection, to directly monitor adult worms. It is also not known how low microfilarial densities need to fall in order to successfully interrupt transmission from the various vector species. As microfilaraemia is an intermediate outcome reflecting infectivity of the human host, it is important to assess comparative effectiveness of drugs that aim to interrupt transmission. Techniques for assessing mf in blood and outcome measures for mf densities need to be standardized with complete reporting of geometric means and standard deviations.</P>
