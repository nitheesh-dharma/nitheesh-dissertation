<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Asthma can be treated with drugs that aim to reduce inflammation in the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are frequently used, but occasionally individuals require oral steroids for adequate control. However, oral steroids are frequently associated with severe side-effects. Azathioprine has been suggested as a useful 'add-on' therapy to oral steroid treatment with the aim of reducing the dose requirement in such cases of severe asthma. The review found two small studies which did not provide adequate evidence as to whether azathioprine could be offered to reduce oral steroid treatment. There is a need for well-designed trials addressing this question before recommendations can be made.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For the majority of chronic asthmatics, symptoms are best controlled by using inhaled steroids. However, for a small group of asthmatics, symptoms can only be controlled by high doses of oral steroids. Continuous use of oral steroid is associated with severe side-effects, but it has been suggested that azathioprine, an immunosuppressive anti-metabolite, often used to reduce the immune response in chronic active hepatitis and severe rheumatoid arthritis, could be useful as an oral steroid sparing agent. There is a need to systematically evaluate the evidence regarding its use to reduce or eliminate oral corticosteroid usage.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of adding azathioprine in patients with stable asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids with the intention of eventually minimizing or eliminating the use of these steroids.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-09 14:20:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two small trials recruiting 23 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. Participants may have been suffering from comorbid lung disease. No data on oral steroid consumption were reported. No significant differences were observed in the studies for FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC, PaO<SUB>2</SUB> and symptoms. One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain. Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to the issue of steroid tapering. An update search conducted in August 2010 did not identify any new studies for consideration in the review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to support the use of azathioprine in the treatment of chronic asthma as a steroid sparing-agent. Large, long-term studies with pre-defined steroid reducing protocols are required before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-11 11:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is an inflammatory disease that usually responds to treatment that focuses on reducing airway inflammation. To achieve control of the inflammation of the airways, inhaled and systemic corticosteroid drugs have been shown to be of proven benefit. However, since large doses of systemic corticosteroid drugs can result in unwanted and potentially serious side effects, the treatment of choice has focused on inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there remains a small sub-group of patients who do not respond adequately to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. These patients tend to fall into two categories. Either they cannot be controlled by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and, therefore need frequent or continued use of oral corticosteroids or some patients simply fail to respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy altogether. While this sub-group of patients is indeed small (it has been estimated that this occurs 1:1000 to 1:10,000 <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>) the clinical course of these types of asthma are often characterised by greater severity and more persistent symptoms. As a result of this clinical dilemma there have been a number of clinical trials examining the use of 'second-line' steroid sparing agents. The concept that these drugs may be of benefit in asthma has arisen from studies showing their benefits in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. It has been proposed that these agents might have a similar effect in reducing steroid dosage in asthmatics. Various drugs have been suggested and include methotrexate, cyclosporin and azathioprine. Whilst Cochrane systematic reviews of methotrexate and cyclosporin have been carried out, to date the benefit of using azathioprine in asthma has not been determined. </P>
<P>Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive anti-metabolite which has attracted attention as a possible steroid sparing agent for use in people with asthma. It has been used as a key agent to prevent allograft reject in organ transplant recipients, being a less toxic derivative of 6 mercaptopurine. It is also used, often in combination with other agents (usually corticosteroids) to influence the immune response in conditions such as chronic active hepatitis and severe rheumatoid arthritis. The exact mechanism of its immunosuppressive action is not certain, but it is known to suppress the cell mediated immune response. Azathioprine induces lymphopenia, reduces the number of both T and B cells, suppresses antibody synthesis, irreversibly inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction and depletes natural killer (NK) cells. Anti-inflammatory effects have also been suggested, such as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and neutrophil trafficking into inflammatory tissue. Since azathioprine has been used successfully with certain other types of inflammatory diseases it is possible that it might also be an useful adjunct to corticosteroids for some asthmatic patients.</P>
<P>Azathioprine is metabolised to mercaptopurine and doses should be reduced when concurrent therapy with allopurinol is given. Immediate cessation of the drug should be carried out following hypersensitivity reactions including malaise, dizziness, vomiting, fever, rigours, muscular pains, arrhythmias, hypotension and interstitial nephritis. The predominant toxic effect is myelosuppression, although hepatic toxicity is also well recognised. Careful monitoring of peripheral blood counts is therefore required. </P>
<P>Whilst narrative reviews of the use of azathioprine in asthma suggest it is of benefit, open and randomised controlled trials, adopting differing methodology and patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, offer conflicting results. To date, no systematic review has been carried out to evaluate the evidence regarding azathioprine as an adjunct to oral corticosteroids in asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of adding azathioprine to oral corticosteroids in adults with stable asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Overall, study quality was judged to be mixed. Although allocation concealment was deemed adequate for these trials and observer blinding was reported for both studies. The method of randomisation was not reported, nor was confirmation of identical presentation of placebo treatment. There was no washout phase between treatment arms in <LINK REF="STD-Hodges-1971a" TYPE="STUDY">Hodges 1971a</LINK>. The participants recruited to the studies suffered from severe asthma and whilst no consensus guidelines on this classification were referenced, detail was presented on symptoms described as 'greatly interfering with life despite adequate conventional therapy'. However, the sample sizes were small (<LINK REF="STD-Hodges-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Hodges 1971</LINK>: n = 10; <LINK REF="STD-Hodges-1971a" TYPE="STUDY">Hodges 1971a</LINK>: n = 13) thus undermining potential generalisability to the general population of severe asthma patients. </P>
<P>Data for the primary outcome identified <I>a priori</I> in the review was not reported in the studies.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review clearly demonstrates that there is a lack of RCT evidence addressing the efficacy of adding azathioprine as an oral corticosteroid-sparing agent for asthma. We have some concerns regarding the patient profile of the two studies reported in this review. In the absence of baseline reversibility testing, the low mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted scores and the measurement of sputum production as an outcome, it is possible that patients with significant lung disease in addition to asthma were recruited in the studies. If this is the case, this would undermine the findings of the studies applied directly in chronic asthma. </P>
<P>Oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma patients represent a small sub-group, but they often have asthma of greater severity and persistence and are at risk of side effects from prolonged use of maintenance doses of oral steroids. Therefore there is a need for trials that assess "add on" therapies. The two trials included in this review did not report the effect of azathioprine on steroid consumption, even though correspondence with one of the trialists revealed that this was an intention of the studies at the outset. </P>
<P>The trialists reported anecdotal evidence of patients with asthma reducing steroid consumption following treatment of azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Hodges-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Hodges 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodges-1971a" TYPE="STUDY">Hodges 1971a</LINK>). This evidence is uncontrolled and as such should be regarded with caution. Until further studies are undertaken which have pre-defined steroid tapering protocols, which recruit adequate numbers of participants, which monitor long-term steroid usage, and which use validated measurements of subjective outcome, evidence of the effects of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent remains scant. </P>
<P>Given the lack of high quality randomised controlled, there is no level 1 evidence to support the effect of azathioprine in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthmatics.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from the two small studies in this review to lend weight to the use of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent in chronic asthma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for robust, well-designed randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of adding azathioprine to oral steroid-dependent asthmatic patients in order to reduce oral corticosteroid consumption.</P>
<P>These should assess the effects of azathioprine in the context of large randomised studies, where a steroid-tapering protocol has been pre-defined and has been adhered to; they need to ensure that long-term follow-up is carried out in order to determine whether steroid reduction can be maintained, and to monitor the effects on white blood cell count and other adverse effects. Adequate assessment of symptoms and lung function should be undertaken.</P>
