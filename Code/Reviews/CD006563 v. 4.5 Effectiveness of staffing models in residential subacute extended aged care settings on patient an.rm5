<P>We included two studies (one interrupted time series and one controlled before-and-after study); both evaluated a primary-care model compared with a either a team-nursing model or a usual-care model. The primary-care model was found to provide slightly better results than the comparator for some outcomes such as resident well-being or behaviour. While nursing staff favoured the primary-care model in one study, neither study found significant improvements in staff outcomes using the primary model compared with the comparator. One study evaluated the uptake of the primary-care model within their facilities and found incorporation of this model into their practice was limited.</P>

<P>Apart from two small studies evaluating primary care, no evidence in the form of concurrently controlled trials could be identified. While these two studies generally favour the use of primary care, the research designs of both ITS and CBA studies are considered prone to bias, specifically selection and blinding of participants and assessors. Therefore, these studies should be regarded with caution and there is little clear evidence for the effective use of any specific model of care in residential aged care to benefit either residents or care staff. Research in this area is clearly needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-11 18:10:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A key concern for managers and nurse administrators of healthcare settings is staffing. Determining and maintaining an appropriate level and mix of staff is especially problematic for those working in the long-term aged-care sector, where resident needs are complex and recruitment and retention of staff is challenging. Many staffing models exist, however, knowing which model is associated with the best outcomes for residents of aged-care facilities is not well established. For example, does having more nurses necessarily equate with better care? Which staffing models are associated with lower staff stress and turnover? How many nurses per resident are optimal? What mix of skills is most appropriate?</P>
<P>One approach is providing staff as a ratio of the number of residents on a unit or ward. The State of Victoria in Australia introduced staff-patient ratios in the public sector in 2001. The ratios were not derived from a strong evidence base but arose as part of an industrial agreement with the State Government. In the US, California has also adopted a staff-patient ratio approach to staffing. However, the literature is divided about the effectiveness of patient-staff ratios. A study conducted by Abt Associates for Centres for Medicare and Medicaid services concluded that there are thresholds of optimal staffing levels, below which quality of care is compromised and above which, there is no significant impact on quality outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cambridge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cambridge 2001</LINK>). A recent systematic review which investigated the effects of nurse staffing in the acute care setting on patient, nurse employee and hospital outcomes failed to find any evidence to support minimum nurse-patient ratios (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 2004</LINK>). The authors recommended that other variables, such as "patient acuity, skill mix, nurse competence, nursing process variables, technological sophistication and institutional support of nursing" (p.335) should be considered when arranging staffing requirements.</P>
<P>An alternate staffing model takes into account the skill mix<B> </B>of staff. Skill mix can be operationalised as the &#8220;mix of posts, grades or occupations in an organisation&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Buchan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchan 2002</LINK>). Staffing ratios have been criticised for being too simplistic, in that they are based on the assumption that all patients and patient days are equal. This is not reflective of reality, where care among patients varies substantially; the amount of care required for an entire admission varies and a focus on patient-staff ratios ignores patient differences and needs (<LINK REF="REF-Graf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mueller suggests that there are a number of factors which should be taken into consideration when considering staffing and skill mix (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2000</LINK>). Aside from the actual care requirements, these factors include the type of unit/ward (e.g. dementia specific), available supporting services, architectural design and layout and staff competency.Mueller uses all these factors to develop a framework for nurse staffing in long-term care (LTC) nursing facilities.</P>
<P>Bowers, Lauring and Jacobson (<LINK REF="REF-Bowers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowers 2001</LINK>) found that nurses working in long-term care reported that consistent assignments (continuity of care) reduced the time necessary to complete their work by reducing the number of unanticipated interruptions. Nurses who organised their workload by <I>resident</I> found they were able to talk to the residents while completing work, spent less time going from room to room and increased the interaction time with residents. Nurses who organised themselves by <I>tasks</I> spent less time interacting with individual residents and more time travelling between &#8216;tasks&#8217;.</P>
<P>Similarly the concept of a primary-care/primary-nursing model has been defined as consisting of the following four fundamental principles (<LINK REF="REF-Manthey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manthey 1980</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>24-hour accountability and decision making by one nurse for several patients over time,</LI>
<LI>case method of assignment,</LI>
<LI>direct communication between caregivers, and</LI>
<LI>a shift in emphasis in the head nurse role to that of facilitator.</LI>
</OL>
<P>McGilton proposed a model of care to enhance the quality of life for residents of long-term care facilities, which involves continuity of care provider, as well as the acquisition of skills and knowledge required to enhance interpersonal relationships and support from nursing supervisors (<LINK REF="REF-McGilton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGilton 2002</LINK>). McGilton's literature review found that continuity of care was not just of benefit to residents (fewer incidences of agitation, improved affect, improved physical integrity, increase in well-being) but also of benefit to care providers (improved attitude towards older people, reduced turnover, decreased job-related stress levels and improved perceptions of the work environment, more certainty about interpretation of residents behaviours, closer relationship with residents). However, it is important to note that continuity of care can be challenging at times when particular residents are difficult to be with on a daily basis.</P>
<P>Some other approaches to staffing in long-term care facilities have been listed (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>).Under a functional or hierarchical model, nursing assistants (NAs) assist residents with activities of daily living while licensed practising nurses (LPNs) administer medication and treatments, and both registered nurses' (RNs)/LPNs' roles include assessment, documentation and care planning. The focus of a team-based model is shared responsibility and accountability for a specific group of residents, while under a case-management approach, total care is provided for a resident by one nurse per shift, however without any 24-hour responsibility. Under a primary-nursing approach, every patient is assigned an individual nurse who plans, evaluates and administers care.</P>
<P>Finally, evidence from a number of studies suggest that there is a correlation between the number of nursing staff and the quality of care residents receive in residential aged-care facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Maas-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 2008a</LINK>). Other reports have described the likely reduction in outcomes common to residents of nursing homes such as pressure ulcers, falls, urinary incontinence and even social isolation with an increase in knowledgeable nursing staff. However, few studies have attempted to directly evaluate the effectiveness of reducing these outcomes.</P>
<P>Therefore, the objective of this review was to identify all available controlled trials that have evaluated nursing models in residential aged care designed to reduce negative outcomes for residents.</P>

<P>Staffing models, in the context of this review, refer to how staffing was organised to meet resident/patient needs and thus includes the mix, and the level of skills. Staffing models have further been defined as "integrating the vision on the patient and the design of the organisation" (<LINK REF="STD-Boumans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boumans 2005</LINK>). Therefore, such interventions as staffing ratios, skill mixes, continuity of care and primary nursing and their effects on resident and staff outcomes are of interest.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-05-09 09:03:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Getting staff mixes and numbers right to ensure that residents of aged-care facilities receive the best care and experience the best quality of life possible has been an ongoing issue for managers of these facilities. To date, it is unclear if there are effective models of care that can ensure the most positive outcomes for residents. Therefore, this review will attempt to identify and assess the quality of all experimental research designed to evaluate the effectiveness of specific nursing models in improving resident quality of life and health outcomes. The review will also consider what research in this area still needs to be conducted.</P>

<P> We identified primary studies by searching bio-medical bibliographic databases, hand-searching and searching grey literature resources. The Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) developed search strategies for the EPOC Trials Register, and MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases in consultation with the review authors.  We constructed and ran additional searches in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and Ageline. We searched DARE (Database of Abstracts and Reviews) for related reviews. Search strategies used controlled vocabulary, such as MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), and keywords describing the concepts of staffing models and residential care. We restricted search resultsby methodological filters for study design (RCT, CCT, CBA, ITS) and EPOC-relevant interventions. We did not apply any language restrictions. The search date was August 27, 2007. Starting dates and interface for each database searched are provided below. We searched grey literature resourcesusing the following keywords in Google: residential aged care, nursing homes, nurse skill mix.</P>

<P>We identified 1760 studies and excluded 1729 outright from examination of the title and abstract. We retrieved 41 studies for evaluation of the full paper. We included two studies; one ITS study and one CBA study. The majority of papers that we identified by the search strategy did not evaluate any nursing models with a concurrent control group or with another nursing model, rather they examined the relationship between staffing levels and resident outcomes, usually over a number of sites.</P>
<P>Both studies that met the inclusion criteria evaluated primary models of care in residential aged care against a team-nursing model (involving RNs and NAs) (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>), or against a usual-care model (involving RNs only) (<LINK REF="STD-Boumans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boumans 2005</LINK>). While the Wilson study described their intervention as "primary care" and the Boumans study termed it "patient-centred care", they are essentially referring to the same type of care model; one in which resident assignment to one nurse or care staff member, and changes in nursing practice is the focus of the intervention.</P>

</P>
<P>In a single ITS study with cross-over, both residents and staff of a 45-bed geriatric rehabilitation unit (Unit 1) and a 45-bed, long-term care unit (Unit 2) received or provided care using either a primary-care model or a team-nursing model (control).</P>
<P>Primary care was defined as consisting of the following four fundamental principles as defined by <LINK REF="REF-Manthey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manthey 1980</LINK>;</P>
<OL>
<LI>24-hour accountability and decision making by one nurse for several patients over time,</LI>
<LI>case method of assignment,</LI>
<LI>direct communication between caregivers, and</LI>
<LI>a shift in emphasis in the head nurse role to that of facilitator.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Team nursing was defined as a hierarchical system where patient care is supervised by a RN, the team leader and the actual provision of care is assigned to various skill levels of personnel according to the complexity of the patients needs and care requirements .</P>
<P>Over a two-year period evaluation of resident well-being and satisfaction, changes in nursing practice, and measures of staff morale, the results showed that neither nursing model was superior to the other for many of the measures (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Where a significant difference was identified, the primary-nursing model was in all cases found to be superior.</P>
<P>For measures of patient well-being, the authors reported that primary nursing led to a limited number of improvements, specifically an increase in the score for the Geriatric Residents' Goals scale for Unit 1 only (highest mean score of 58 for primary nursing compared with 51 for team nursing P = 0.007), and an improvement in the Tranquility-Agitation Scale score for Unit 2 only (highest mean score 38 for primary nursing compared with 36 for team nursing, P = 0.004). Patient knowledge of nurses' names was significantly greater in those cared for with the primary-care model compared with the team model in the geriatric unit (Unit 1) but not reported for Unit 2 (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nursing practice measures identified a number of significant improvements when the primary-care model was practiced compared with team nursing (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The chance that the same caregiver provided care from one week to the next was higher with the primary-care model for both units (e.g. 4.8 ± 1.3 days/week primary nursing versus 2.0 ± 1.0 days per week team nursing for Unit 1, P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of days that the nurse signature on the daily nurses notes matched the signature on the monthly nursing summary was significantly higher during primary care for both units (P &lt; 0.05), and the number of days in which the nurse who signed the monthly nursing summary actually cared for the patient was significantly higher during primary care for both units (P &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>No significant difference between primary and team nursing was seen for any staff morale measures (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cost of nursing hours and use of medical-surgical supplies was not found to be different between the two nursing models.</P>
<P>Overall, the staff survey found that primary nursing was the favoured nursing model compared with the team-nursing model.</P>

<P>In a CBA study, the effectiveness of a resident-oriented care model (experimental) was evaluated compared with usual care (control).</P>
<P>This study first evaluated the extent of uptake of the components of the model, specifically:</P>
<OL>
<LI>resident assignment to one nurse,</LI>
<LI>use of nursing process (evaluating care plans, nursing histories, addressing nursing problems and goals),</LI>
<LI>extent of resident- and ward-oriented tasks, and</LI>
<LI>changes in communication between nurses.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Next, the study evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention to significantly improve effect variables (quality of care, well-being, satisfaction), compared with the control.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Degree of protocol implementation</HEADING>
<P>The study collected data on the extent of implementation of the protocol for a number of variables such as assignment of a resident to a specific caregiver or use of nursing care plans, for both the resident-oriented model and usual care before implementation (pre-test) and at six and 16 months post-implementation (post-test one and two respectively) (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study found that with one exception, assignment of the same nurse to a resident occurred significantly more often in the experimental wards compared with the control wards (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of the nursing process (i.e. use of nursing care plans (P = 0.008), taking nursing histories and identifying nursing problems and goals (P = 0.002) was also significantly greater in the experimental wards compared with controls (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the focus on the resident in these areas, the conduct of resident-oriented tasks was only significantly different within the psychogeriatric wards (P &lt; 0.001) but not in the somatic wards (P = 0.32) compared with controls (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in ward-oriented tasks, or in the variety of resident- or ward-oriented forms of communication between experimental and control wards (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Interestingly, the quality of various forms of communication implemented (e.g. making clear agreements as to how to approach the residents) was found to be significantly in favour of the usual-care protocol (P = 0.047) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effectiveness of intervention</HEADING>
<P>The study also collected data on the effect that resident-oriented care had on specific effect variables such as co-ordination of care and resident satisfaction with care compared with usual care before implementation (pre-test) and at six and 16 months post-implementation (post-test one and two respectively) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analysis of the effect variables found that the intervention did not significantly improve resident or family satisfaction with care, resident well-being, assessment of resident well-being by a significant other compared with control (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effect variables that indicate the quality of care (co-ordination of care, instrumental aspects and expressive aspects) showed mixed results by post-test two. Co-ordination of care was found to have significantly increased in three of the experimental wards (two psychogeriatric wards and one somatic ward) compared with controls (P &lt; 0.003) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>), whereas one somatic ward actually showed significant improvement in co-ordination of care in the usual-care ward (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Measurement of expressive aspects found a significant improvement in the experimental wards compared with controls (P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>), but no significant difference was found between treatment groups for the measure of instrumental aspects (P = 0.4) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>While both studies showed some significant improvement in one or more residents' outcomes, when the intervention was being performed, the research design precluded the ability of either study to blind residents, staff or assessors to treatment designation. In fact, no mention was made in either study of any attempt to blind any component of the study. Therefore, there was the potential for significant performance and detection bias within both studies. Even with a cross-over design used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>), at each assessment point the allocation of each resident was known. In the study of the resident-oriented care model (<LINK REF="STD-Boumans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boumans 2005</LINK>), blinding of the resident to treatment designation may have been accounted for by the application of the intervention to a whole ward while keeping a control ward separate, and by the assessment of some of the effect outcomes by the residents or families pre- and post-intervention.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 09:03:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has highlighted that little, if any, research using a concurrent control group method has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any nursing models in residential aged care for the improvement of resident and care staff outcomes. Despite the overwhelming volume of publications that suggests that there is a distinct relationship between staffing levels in residential aged care and outcomes of improved well-being in residents as well as staff satisfaction and staff turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Bostick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bostick 2006</LINK>), no experimental evidence was found to substantiate these claims for these outcomes.There is also little evidence on the precise skill mix required to improve these same outcomes. The only experimental evidence identified in this review was in the form of two studies that evaluated the implementation of primary-care models on resident outcomes, staff satisfaction and nursing practice.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-09 09:03:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two studies identified in this review suggest that at the very least the primary-care model is preferred by staff. In a single ITS, cross-over study, 92% of respondents preferred the primary nursing model over the team-nursing model after one year of exposure to both models (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>). Interestingly, in a single CBA study the implementation of a primary-care model had no effect on perceived resident well-being or satisfaction or on family satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Boumans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boumans 2005</LINK>). While the primary-care model was shown to produce better outcomes for residents on some outcome measures, the results are hardly convincing. Despite the cross-over nature of <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>, improvements in the residents' outcomes were not consistently found for the primary-care intervention. For example, Unit 2 found a significant improvement in the residents tranquillity-agitation score under the primary-care model but Unit 1 found no difference between the two groups scores after cross-over from the team-nursing model into the primary-care model. Further, this study showed no effect of a primary-care nursing model on improving staff outcomes such as job satisfaction, absenteeism or staff turnover when compared with a team-nursing model.</P>
<P>This was also the case with a study of a primary-care model described as "patient-oriented care" situated in three aged-care facilities in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Boumans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boumans 2005</LINK>). While the incorporation of some of the process aspects of the primary model were instituted, principally resident assignment to one carer, the intervention had little effect on improving resident outcomes of well-being and satisfaction with care. A possible explanation for the lack of an improvement is likely to be due to the poor overall uptake of the process components of the model. While there was an increase in the degree of resident assignment and the use of nursing processes, the degree of implementation was not universal over the period of the study. In fact, no significant difference was found in the extent of uptake of ward-oriented tasks or in the degree of nursing communication during the study compared with the control period. The authors acknowledge that maintaining the processes within the ward was made difficult due to instability on the ward (staff turnover and leadership changes).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-09 09:03:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As previously noted, the early study performed by Wilson was hampered by poor data reporting which prevented independent confirmation of the findings of the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1989</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Therefore, the results of this study should be seen as an encouraging beginning in the evaluation of a primary-care model in aged-care facilities but of little value in informing practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-05-09 09:03:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence to assess the effectiveness of staffing models in residential aged care is poor. Only two studies of the number we originally identified met the inclusion criteria, primarily due to the absence of a concurrent control group. Both examined the effectiveness of primary-care or patient-centred care nursing models compared with team nursing or usual care on resident and staff outcomes. Lack of randomisation, blinding or prevention of contamination are key limitations of the validity of the studies. Variability in results, such as effects in favour of the control group in one ward or unit and similar effects in favour of the experimental group in another ward or unit, make any concrete conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention difficult.</P>
<P>Finally, it is interesting that since 1993 only one concurrently controlled study has evaluated the effectiveness of primary-care models in residential aged-care facilities on resident or staff outcomes. The reason is unclear, but is consistent with the general absence of research being performed in the residential aged-care setting compared with that in the acute-care sector.</P>
