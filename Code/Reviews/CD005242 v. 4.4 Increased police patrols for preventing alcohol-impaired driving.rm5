<TITLE>Increased police patrols for preventing alcohol-impaired driving</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-08 15:08:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More than one million people are killed worldwide each year in traffic crashes. Driving after drinking alcohol increases the chance of a traffic crash. To reduce alcohol-impaired driving, some police agencies have increased the number of police patrols or the time the police spend patrolling. The aim of these increased patrols is to raise the perceived and actual likelihood that impaired drivers will be identified and stopped. Identification is based on observable behavioral cues, which include moving violations, erratic driving, and crash involvement. In response to these cues, police officers stop the driver and administer tests for alcohol impairment. We found 32 studies that tested the effects of increased police patrols on traffic deaths, injuries, and crashes. There was one randomized controlled trial and no quasi-randomized controlled trials. Almost all of the programs included additional interventions like community information programs, media campaigns, and special training for police officers. Most studies found that increased police patrols reduced traffic crashes and fatalities. Evidence for the effect on traffic injuries was less consistent. The detail provided on the methodology of included studies was almost uniformly poor. When this information was reported, the methodological quality was often weak. Therefore, the available evidence does not firmly establish that increased police patrols reduce the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving. Good quality controlled studies with adequate sample size are needed to evaluate increased patrols. Also needed are studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.</P>

<P>Road traffic injuries cause 1.2 million deaths worldwide each year. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of traffic crashes, especially fatal crashes. Increased police patrols aim to increase both the perceived and actual likelihood of being caught driving while alcohol-impaired, potentially reducing alcohol-related driving, crashes and injuries.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 23:27:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 32 eligible studies included one randomized controlled trial, eight controlled before-after studies, 14 controlled ITS studies, six ITS studies, and three studies with both ITS and controlled before-after analyses. Most interventions targeted only alcohol-impaired driving (69%) and included additional interventions such as media campaigns or special training for police officers (91%). Only two studies reported sufficient information to assess study quality completely. Two-thirds of studies were scored 'not adequate' on at least one feature. Five of six studies evaluating traffic fatalities reported reductions with the intervention, but differences were statistically significant in only one study. Effects of intervention on traffic injuries were inconsistent in the six studies evaluating this outcome, and no results were statistically significant. All four controlled studies evaluating fatal crashes reported reductions with the intervention, which were statistically significant in one study. All 12 controlled studies assessing injury crashes reported greater reductions with the intervention, though effects were minimal or not significant in several studies. ITS studies showed less consistent effects on fatal crashes (three studies) and injury crashes (four studies), and effect estimates were typically imprecise. Thirteen of 20 studies showed reductions in total crashes and about two-thirds of these were statistically significant.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-03 08:15:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies examining increased police patrol programs were generally consistent in reporting beneficial effects on traffic crashes and fatalities, but study quality and reporting were often poor. Methodological limitations included inadequate sample size, dissimilar baseline measures, contamination, and inadequate data analysis. Thus existing evidence, although supportive, does not firmly establish whether increased police patrols, implemented with or without other intervention elements, reduce the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-03 09:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An estimated 1.2 million deaths due to road traffic crashes occurred worldwide in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>). In high-income countries, motor vehicle-related injuries kill more children and young adults than any other single cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002</LINK>). At the same time, the highest rates of road-traffic fatalities are reported in the low- and middle-income regions of the eastern Mediterranean and in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the World Health Organization's World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>), alcohol impairment increases the risk of both motor vehicle crash involvement and resulting death or serious injury. After adjusting for demographic covariates and potential sources of bias, <LINK REF="REF-Blomberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blomberg 2005</LINK> found a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and traffic crashes. An increase in traffic crash involvement was observed at blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) as low as 0.01 g/dl.  At a BAC of 0.08 g/dl, the risk of any type of crash was 2.7 times greater than with a BAC of 0.00 g/dl. </P>
<P>Alcohol contributes to traffic-related injuries and deaths throughout the world. In 2005, 23% of US drivers aged 15 to 20 years who were killed in crashes had a BAC level of 0.08 g/dl or higher (<LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2005</LINK>). Of all drivers killed in Great Britain in 2004, 25% had a BAC level of 0.08 g/dl or higher (<LINK REF="REF-TRL-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRL 2006</LINK>). In African countries, an estimated 31% to 56% of non-fatally injured drivers were either alcohol-impaired or over the legal BAC limit, while in the southeast Asian region, 11% to 44% of patients hospitalized after traffic crashes had consumed alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>). In Bangalore, India (<LINK REF="REF-Gururaj-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gururaj 2004</LINK>), 22% of people who experienced brain injuries in a road traffic incident were under the influence of alcohol.</P>
<P>Alcohol-impaired driving is common, worldwide. In one US survey, 4.5% of adults reported having driven while impaired at least once in the preceding 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2006</LINK>). Over 4% of drivers participating in roadside BAC surveys in Croatia were found to be alcohol-impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Gledec-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gledec 2004</LINK>). In roadside BAC surveys in European Union countries (<LINK REF="REF-ETSC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETSC 1995</LINK>), 1% to 3% of drivers reported driving while impaired. In Ghana (<LINK REF="REF-Mock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 2001</LINK>), more than 7% of drivers had BAC levels above 0.08 g/dl in a random, roadside survey.</P>
<P>Both the perceived and actual likelihood of arrest for alcohol-impaired driving are low in most countries and various interventions designed to increase perceived or actual risk have been tested. Increasing the perceived risk of arrest appears to deter alcohol-impaired driving more effectively than increasing the severity of the penalty after arrest (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homel-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweedler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweedler 1995</LINK>). Enforcement measures, such as increased breath testing, sobriety checkpoints, and increased police patrols, can increase both perceived and actual arrest risk.</P>
<P>Both selective and random breath testing at sobriety checkpoints, where law enforcement officers systematically stop drivers to assess impairment objectively, reduce alcohol-impaired driving, alcohol-related crashes, and associated injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Shults-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shults 2001</LINK>). However, many US states are reluctant to conduct sobriety checkpoints because they are believed to be costly or ineffective, or because of legal or policy reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Fell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fell 2004</LINK>). In 2000, sobriety checkpoints were illegal in 12 states in the US. In several states that did allow checkpoints, prosecutors and elected officials objected to their use.</P>
<P>Increased police patrols are another intervention designed to increase the perceived and actual likelihood of being caught driving while alcohol-impaired. Increased (sometimes described as saturation, selective, or roving) patrols augment the number of officers or the time they spend on patrol to increase the likelihood that impaired drivers will be identified. Identification is based on observable behavioral cues, which include moving violations, erratic driving, and crash involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Voas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 1990</LINK>). In response to these cues, police officers stop the driver and administer tests for alcohol impairment. Because an increase in police patrols does not require the purchase of costly equipment, such as roadside breath-alcohol testing devices (<LINK REF="STD-Stuster-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 1995</LINK>), it may be more readily implemented than sobriety checkpoints in low- and middle-income countries, although cost comparisons have not accounted for high costs of fuel and vehicle maintenance.</P>
<P>The effects of increased patrols may be enhanced by mass media campaigns, including public service announcements and paid media (for example, advertisements), as well as by 'earned' (unpaid) media coverage generated by the activities of an intervention (for example, news stories) or fostered by the campaign (for example, through letters to the editor, grass roots advocacy) (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/SafeSobr/19qp/sect1/page4.html">www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/SafeSobr/</A>). Media-based intervention components seek to increase motorists' perception of the risk of being caught. Media efforts are also used to increase public acceptance of enforcement of laws against driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) while decreasing public tolerance for alcohol-impaired driving (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 2004</LINK>). In some cases, increased patrols are also combined with sobriety checkpoints or other interventions, such as community or school education programs, anti-DUI laws, and facilitation of DUI prosecution.  Whether the addition of a media campaign is necessary for increased patrols to be effective has not been established, nor has the added value of these other components.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-08-03 05:38:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An earlier meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Zobeck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zobeck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagenaar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagenaar 1995</LINK>) examined the effects of increased police patrols on alcohol-related injuries and crashes. Although on average such patrols were associated with reductions in crashes and casualties, the review authors noted that many studies had weak designs. A review that updates the literature on increased police patrols is needed.  In addition, this review explored the contributions of media campaigns and other components when added to increased patrols.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series were included. The units of study were individual participants, groups, intervention sites, or geographical areas.</P>
<P>Political or economic grounds that are beyond the investigator's control are often the basis for the implementation of laws, policies, and community-based programs, and for the selection of geographic areas to receive these interventions. Therefore, we did not restrict types of studies to randomized and other controlled trials. Inclusion criteria for controlled before and after (before-after) studies and interrupted time series studies were adapted from the data collection checklist of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>).</P>

However, these are thought to be ambiguous outcome measures for special enforcement programs (<LINK REF="REF-Voas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 1990</LINK>) because an increase in arrests could indicate an increase in DUI enforcement activity, an increase in persons driving while alcohol-impaired, or both.

<P>We selected commonly occurring keywords and text words from known relevant papers and initial searches, as well as exploded MeSH terms related to alcohol, driving, and law enforcement that we retrieved from the MeSH database. The Elsevier Life Science (EMTREE), PsycINFO, and Alcohol and Other Drug (<LINK REF="REF-NIAAA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIAAA 2000</LINK>) thesauri were consulted for additional text terms. Other search terms were identified from related reviews, the Cochrane Injuries Review Group search strategies, and consultation with a research librarian. Because of the broad range of types of study designs to be included, we did not include methodological terms. The Trials Search Coordinator for the Cochrane Injuries Group reviewed the search strategy. Search terms encompassed terms related to driving, crashes, drinking, and enforcement (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Eligible studies reported at least one quantifiable outcome relevant to alcohol-impaired driving. We extracted data on alcohol consumption, where reported. We also examined violations, for example, arrests for driving while intoxicated or under the influence. However, these are thought to be ambiguous outcome measures for special enforcement programs (<LINK REF="REF-Voas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 1990</LINK>) because an increase in arrests could indicate an increase in DUI enforcement activity, an increase in persons driving while alcohol-impaired, or both. Therefore, we excluded studies which examined only enforcement outcomes.</P>
<P>Electronic search results were downloaded into ProCite and de-duplicated. One trained screener excluded titles that were clearly irrelevant to both alcohol and driving. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of all remaining citations to identify potentially relevant studies, using the specified selection criteria. Citations judged by both authors as ineligible were excluded. Citations identified by at least one author as definitely or possibly eligible were obtained in full text. Full texts were screened independently for eligibility by two authors. Differences were resolved through discussion; a third author was consulted when necessary. When eligibility could not be determined from available text, we attempted to request further details from the study investigators. If otherwise eligible studies did not report relevant outcome measures, we asked the investigators to provide any unpublished data on such outcomes. Studies were excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) if relevant outcome data were not collected or could not be provided. </P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:44:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data. Authors were not blinded to study investigators' names as the benefit of such masking is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>). Data were extracted on study design, participants, and quality measures. In cases of discrepancy, key information was confirmed by discussion. Persistent discrepancies were referred to a third author.</P>
<P>The intervention information extracted included type of special patrols (for example, drunk driving only, speeding and drunk driving, general traffic); method of increasing patrols (for example, overtime, new hires); frequency of patrolling (for example, weekly, holidays only); and presence of adjunct interventions such as sobriety checkpoints, special equipment (for example, passive alcohol sensors, video cameras), or mass media campaigns (for example, public service announcements, paid advertising, news stories).</P>
<P>We extracted outcome measurements for fatal, injury (all or non-fatal only), and total crashes (for which the crash was the unit of measurement); fatal and total injuries (for which the individual was the unit of measurement); drunk driving; and alcohol consumption. Enforcement of alcohol-impaired driving (for example, arrests, citations) was extracted as a measure of police activity. Only those outcomes that met minimum design criteria (see 'Types of studies' above) were extracted. For each selected outcome measure, data on blinding, reliability, and for ITS designs appropriate statistical analysis, were extracted.</P>
<P>In most studies crash data were collected from traffic crash reports routinely completed at the scene by police officers. As a result, the definition of alcohol-involved crashes varied substantially between studies. Alcohol involvement may have been assessed through BAC, by the police officer at the crash scene, or not at all. In the latter cases one or more proxy measures for alcohol-involved crashes were typically collected and reported. We reported direct measures of 'alcohol-involved crashes' (whether from BAC or police report) when these were provided and a proxy measure when direct measures were not provided. Where more than one proxy measure for alcohol-related crashes was collected we selected one measure for this review using a predefined hierarchy. This hierarchy was based on the likelihood that the specified type of crash was alcohol-related (<LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2005</LINK>). Specifically, within each crash type (that is, total, injury, fatal) outcome measures were chosen in the following order:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Alcohol-involved crashes</LI>
<LI>Single vehicle, night-time crashes</LI>
<LI>All night-time crashes</LI>
<LI>All single vehicle crashes</LI>
<LI>All crashes</LI>
</OL>
<P>Measuring alcohol involvement through police reports has the potential to be biased due to police officers&#8217; knowledge of the intervention, as was suggested by some investigators (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>). Therefore, we compared within-study results for police-reported alcohol-related crashes and selected proxy measures in order to identify any systematic bias in magnitude or direction of effect, or statistical significance of results.  We identified all eight studies that collected both police-reported alcohol involvement and either of two proxy measures highly associated with alcohol-involvement -- single vehicle night-time crashes, if available, otherwise all night-time crashes -- for the same outcome type (<LINK REF="STD-Brackett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Brackett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK>).  Results for the two measures are presented side-by-side in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.  For seven of eight studies and 10 of 11 comparisons, the direction of effect and statistical significance (or lack of) were the same with comparable effect magnitude. These data do not suggest a systematic bias toward greater effects of intervention when results from police-reported alcohol-involved crashes are selected over other proxy measures.</P>
<P>For RCTs and CTs, we extracted post-test rates or proportions for intervention and comparison areas. For controlled before-after studies, we extracted pre-test and post-test rates or proportions for intervention and comparison areas. For ITS designs and controlled ITS designs, we extracted results of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analyses or time series regressions with adjustments or tests for serial correlation, when available. When these analyses were not performed, we extracted individual data points if they were provided in a graph or a table. To obtain data points from graphs, figures were scanned to computer and digitized. Then CurveUnscan 1.4 software (www.curveunscan.com) was used to calibrate the axes and read x and y coordinates from each point on the figure. Similar approaches have previously been described (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Grilli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 2002</LINK>). When neither ARIMA analyses nor data points were provided, we provided the investigator-reported results.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-05 17:09:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by the reporting of design and conduct features that are likely to prevent systematic errors or bias. To assess study quality of RCTs, CTs, and CBAs we used the guidelines provided by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) checklist (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>). We applied the quality criteria used by <LINK REF="REF-Aaserud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaserud 2006</LINK> to ITS studies. A few of these quality criteria were revised to be appropriate to the intervention and population for this particular review. The detailed quality criteria are listed in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. The quality assessment for each study is described in the method section of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. For all assessments, we assigned 'not clear' when sufficient information to make an adequate determination could not be obtained from the full text or from the investigators, and 'not adequate' if it was clear that the study did not satisfy the conditions for scoring 'adequate' (see below). When a study included more than one comparison group, quality criteria were applied to the group most similar to the intervention group, unless both comparison groups were equally similar to the intervention group in which case both groups were included in the quality assessment. When multiple outcome measures were extracted, each outcome measure underwent quality assessment for blinding, reliability, and for ITS designs appropriate statistical analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary comparison was between intervention and no-intervention (control) geographical areas or time periods. For all included studies we stated the results for each relevant outcome. We also compared intervention programs with and without adjuncts. Statistical significance was reported, when possible.</P>
<P>For RCTs and CTs, we calculated relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between groups.</P>
<P>For CBAs, we calculated rate ratios, that is, the ratio of post-test to pre-test event rates in the intervention group (for example, area) divided by the corresponding ratio in the comparison group. The rate ratio can be used to determine the percent change in the intervention group relative to the comparison group. For example, a rate ratio of 0.75 can be interpreted as a 25% reduction from the pre-test phase to the post-test phase in the intervention group relative to the comparison group; 95% CIs were calculated when possible. When rate ratios could not be calculated from the reported data, we provided the results as reported by the study investigator.</P>
<P>For ITS and CITS studies that reported ARIMA or time series regression analyses with adjustments or tests for serial correlation, we reported the mean change from pre-test to post-test, corresponding standard error, the t-value from the test of the transfer function (for ARIMA analyses), the corresponding statistical significance, and the percentage change from pre-test to post-test, when provided. For all other ITS and CITS studies, and if adequate data were provided, we calculated and reported the pre-test and post-test means and standard deviations. To test intervention effects we employed a time series regression analysis with maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting for first-order autocorrelation as described by <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Aaserud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaserud 2006</LINK> (SPSS 13.0). Model parameters included pre-test slope, post-test slope, change in level, an intercept, and an error term, which were used to predict the outcome at any given time point. Parameter estimates from this model were used to determine the change in slope, which is defined as the difference between the pre-test and post-test slopes; and the change in level, which is defined as the difference between the first post-test time point estimated from the post-intervention regression line and the same post-test time point extrapolated from the pre-intervention regression line (<LINK REF="REF-Grilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grilli 2002</LINK>). The change in level reflects the immediate change at the start of the intervention, while the change in slope reflects the overall changes. Change in slope, change in level, corresponding standard error, and statistical significance were reported. An alpha level of 0.05 was selected. Time series that were missing data for large numbers of time points (for example, a series of weekly data points separated by several months with no data) could not be analyzed. When neither a data table nor graph was provided, or data could not be analyzed, we showed results as reported by the study investigator.</P>
<P>Because fewer than half of the study analyses provided sufficient data to allow for meta-analysis, we felt that combining data quantitatively could be misleading. Therefore, the results are summarized narratively. In addition, to aid interpretation we created figures showing the results for each outcome. For total, fatal and injury crashes, and fatal and total injuries, we plotted the point estimates and error measurements, when available, in the figures. For CBA designs, the rate ratios and 95% CIs were plotted. For ITS designs, the change in slope (or mean change when available) and 95% CIs were plotted. For CITS designs, we plotted the difference in mean change between the intervention and comparison groups, when available; CIs for this difference could not be calculated. In order to display figures with different units on one graph, estimates of change in slope or mean change and standard error were standardized to the change in outcome per year. We reported the change in slope versus change in level, because it detects gradual change, including changes that occur as an intervention is disseminated over time; and because it is more similar to investigator-calculated ARIMA results. Although statistical significance can be inferred from CIs, when available, we have also noted each statistically significant effect with an asterisk. To differentiate between effects that were not statistically significant and those that were not tested for statistical significance, the latter are noted with a dagger. Results that could not be depicted are reported in the text and figures. Where no data were provided, results are listed in the figures as &#8216;reduced crashes,&#8217; &#8216;increased crashes,&#8217; or &#8216;no effect.&#8217;  </P>
<P>Throughout this review we have used &#8216;reduction&#8217; or &#8216;beneficial&#8217; whenever the reported result was less than 0.00 (for change) or &lt; 1.0 (for rate ratio, relative risk (RR), or odds ratio (OR)). We have used &#8216;harmful&#8217; whenever the reported result was greater than 0.00 (for change) or &gt; 1.0 (for rate ratio, RR, or OR).  When a &#8216;harmful&#8217; or &#8216;beneficial&#8217; effect was minimal (for example, RR = 1.01) we indicated this in the text.</P>

<P>Thirty-two eligible studies were identified (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Investigators of 27 studies were traced. Additional data or methodological information were provided by investigators for 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aden-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Aden 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sali-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Sali 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Amick 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hingson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hingson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK> ;<LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 2002</LINK>). One investigator provided an additional study (<LINK REF="STD-NMDOH-2000" TYPE="STUDY">NMDOH 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One project was published as three separate studies, each of which reported a unique pair of sites (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>). These were included as separate studies. Another project was published as three separate studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>; Jones 1995 under <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>) and used a single site as the control for two of the intervention sites (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>). We grouped the results of both of those comparisons together. Hence, this project was included as two rather than three studies. </P>
<P>A program established by the US Department of Transportation in the early 1970s, the Alcohol Safety Action Projects (ASAP), was tested in 35 communities across the US, each was reported separately as well as together (USDOT 1979 under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>). This program was conceptualized as a community-based intervention program involving four specified countermeasures that were implemented and evaluated at multiple sites using the same outcomes. The ASAP program was not applied identically in the different communities and differences in other factors (for example, population, geography) may have influenced results. It is, nevertheless, appropriate to evaluate the program as a whole, given the apparent intention to do so in the initial program development and evaluation (USDOT 1972 under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>). The ASAPs have been reviewed and meta-analyzed previously (<LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>). This meta-analysis is included in the Tables and the descriptions of studies below as a single, controlled before-after study.</P>
<P>Of the 32 studies included, most (91%) were conducted in the United States. Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand also served as study sites. The most common study design was a controlled ITS (44%). There were eight controlled before-after studies, six ITS studies, and three studies that included both controlled before-after and ITS analyses. There was one randomized controlled trial and no quasi-randomized controlled trials.</P>
<P>The majority (69%) of interventions were targeted specifically and solely to reduction of DUI. Four interventions targeted DUI and other traffic violations (speeding, failure to wear a seat belt, or both) and two targeted all traffic or moving violations, including DUI. One program had different targets (that is, DUI, speeding, all moving violations, or high accident areas) at different intervention sites; one intervention targeted both DUI and underage drinking; one targeted high accident areas; and one did not specify the primary target.</P>
<P>The method by which patrols were increased varied. The most commonly used were: reassigning regular officers to DUI enforcement (25%), having regular officers work extra hours (overtime) (19%), or a combination of these two methods (13%). A few programs hired new officers (6%), 'borrowed' officers from nearby communities (3%), or combined new hires and reassignment (6%). In three studies (9%) involving multiple intervention sites (<LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK>), different methods or combinations of methods, including overtime, reassignment, and in some programs new hires, were used at different sites. Six studies (19%) did not specify how patrols were increased.</P>
<P>Three studies indicated that increased patrols occurred regularly but did not specify the timing, and five failed to specify the frequency of patrols. Among the 24 remaining studies, extra patrols occurred daily in seven studies (29%), four to six days per week in four (17%), every weekend in six (25%), and less frequently (for example, weekly, on holidays, or sporadically) in seven studies (29%).</P>
<P>The duration and timing of the interventions varied substantially, from 1 to 60 months, with a median duration of 15 months. Thirteen interventions lasted two or more years. For two studies with multiple intervention groups, intervention periods ranged from 12 to 48 months (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK>) and from 24 to 60 months (<LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>), respectively.</P>
<P>Three studies (9%) evaluated increased patrols alone, 28 (88%) included other additional interventions, and one (3%) evaluated increased patrols both alone and in combination with other interventions by including comparison groups with and without other interventions. Of 29 studies that evaluated additional interventions, 86% included more than one additional intervention. Almost all (90%) incorporated public awareness or education components, including community or school-based public information and awareness programs, media campaigns, media coverage, or public advocacy and grassroots campaigns. Other commonly added interventions included special DUI training and equipment for officers (55%), sobriety checkpoints or random breath testing (31%), and coordination of sentencing or parole processes (21%).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stuster-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 1995</LINK>) compared increased patrols to an alternative intervention that was not also present in the intervention area. All other comparisons were included in the primary analysis.</P>
<P>Most studies (84%) measured and reported multiple, relevant outcomes. More than half (56%) reported at least one outcome directly related to motor vehicle crashes resulting from alcohol-impaired driving. These included alcohol-related total crashes (78%), fatal crashes (22%), and injury crashes (22%). The remaining studies used various proxy measures including: injuries or fatalities occurring either in any traffic crashes or in night-time traffic crashes; or injury, fatal or total crashes (single vehicle, night time, weekend, or all types combined). Nine studies (28%) measured alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
<P>Nearly half of the studies (47%) reported outcomes documenting police enforcement of drinking and driving laws. These measures included DUI warnings, citations or arrests, blood alcohol levels of arrested drivers, and total warnings or citations.</P>
<P>Some studies also measured outcomes not directly related to alcohol-impaired driving, such as other types of crashes (for example, property damage only, daytime crashes); injuries (for example, pedestrian fatalities); or traffic citations (for example, for speeding). These outcomes were not reported on.</P>

<P>The detail provided on the methodology of included studies was almost uniformly poor and, when adequately reported, the methodology was often judged to be of poor quality. Of 32 identified studies only two reported sufficient information on all design and conduct features to enable a complete assessment of study quality; and just one (3%) of those (<LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK>) was adequate on all features assessed. Twenty-one studies (69%) were rated as 'not adequate' on at least one key design or conduct feature. The rest (28%) did not report sufficient information to assess study quality fully, although reported items were deemed adequate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study design and analysis</HEADING>
<P>
<I>RCTs</I>: The one RCT, which allocated groups by coin toss, showed data for baseline measures from which relative risks for the selected outcomes could be calculated. There were no significant differences between study groups in baseline measures for outcomes or other characteristics. This trial had less than 80% follow up, however. </P>
<P>
<I>CBAs</I>: Among 11 studies that included controlled before-after analyses, eight provided enough information to assess at least one quality criterion. Of these, three reported that baseline measures were similar, four that other baseline characteristics were similar, and one that contamination between intervention and control groups was unlikely.</P>
<P>
<I>ITS:</I> All nine studies that included uncontrolled ITS analyses provided sufficient information to assess at least two quality criteria, although none could be completely assessed. All studies pre-specified the shape of the intervention effect. Four provided sufficient numbers of pre-test and post-test data points, but two of these provided sufficient data points for only some outcome measures. All nine failed to provide information on whether the intervention was likely to affect data collection.</P>
<P>
<I>CITS</I>: The 14 CITS studies tended to include more methodological details, with 13 (93%) reporting on at least three design or conduct criteria. Eight reported sufficient information to assess baseline measures for outcomes, of which five demonstrated similar measures in intervention and control areas. All studies reported on other baseline characteristics, and 11 showed that they were similar between groups. Seven of eight studies evaluating possible effects of contamination indicated that it was unlikely. One study indicated that the intervention was not independent of other changes over time. Nine studies used sufficient numbers and intervals of pre-test and post-test data points in their analysis, while 12 studies met the criterion 'rational explanation for effect shape'. No studies noted that the intervention was unlikely to affect data collection, although one (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>) performed a sensitivity analysis to examine an outcome measurement change that occurred near the start of the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes assessment</HEADING>
<P>Data on selected primary outcomes were gathered mostly from police records and accident records systems. Two studies used government registries of motor vehicles (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hingson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hingson 1996</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>) specified its source of injury crashes as Ministry of Transport accident reports but did not report the data source for road fatalities. Data sources for five studies were not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Aden-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Aden 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pigman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pigman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maynard_x002d_Moody-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard-Moody 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 2001</LINK>). We assessed the reliability of all data sources as 'not clear'.</P>
<P>None of the studies commented specifically on blinding of primary outcome measurements. Fatal, injury and crash outcomes are typically collected routinely by traffic safety or public safety agencies (including police departments and state patrols).  When a research study uses such data as outcome measures, there is a risk of bias when the agency collecting and reporting the data is aware of the intervention. However, we were not able to ascertain with certainty, for any study, that those individuals or agencies collecting the data definitely had knowledge of the intervention. Therefore, all such outcomes were rated as 'not clear' in terms of blinding of outcomes assessment.</P>
<P>All CITS studies except <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK> employed ARIMA analyses, time series regressions, or other analyses that included adjustments or tests for serial correlation. Only one ITS study did so (<LINK REF="STD-Pigman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pigman 1984</LINK>), but it did not describe adjusting or testing for serial correlation, hence it was scored as 'not clear'. Another ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>) reported fatality data only in a graph but performed a time series analysis of injury crash data, without adjusting or testing for serial correlation. These outcomes were assessed separately and were scored as 'not adequate' and 'not clear', respectively. All other ITS studies provided sufficient data for reanalysis using time series regression and hence were scored as 'adequate'.</P>

Six studies, including the Alcohol Safety Action Project (ASAP), reported effects of increased patrols on fatalities from traffic crashes (<LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Louis-Police-1981" TYPE="STUDY">St Louis Police 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2001</LINK>). In five of six studies, fatalities were reduced in the intervention group compared with pre-test or comparison groups; differences were statistically significant in one study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK> reported a reduction in the intervention relative to comparison areas (rate ratio = 0.78); however, insufficient data were provided for calculation of CIs. All three ITS studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Louis-Police-1981" TYPE="STUDY">St Louis Police 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1991</LINK>) showed small to moderate post-test decreases in both level (range: &lt; -1 to -8 fatalities) and slope (range: -1 to -12 fatalities per year) that were statistically significant in one study (<LINK REF="STD-St-Louis-Police-1981" TYPE="STUDY">St Louis Police 1981</LINK>); change in slope was of borderline significance in another (<LINK REF="STD-Hurst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurst 1981</LINK>). The CBA by <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2001</LINK> showed a minimal relative reduction after intervention (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.89).</P>
<P>The ASAPs were initially evaluated with a one-way ANOVA test and investigators reported a small but statistically significant reduction in the ratio of night-time to daytime fatal crashes (NHTSA 1975 under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>). The authors justified using a one-way ANOVA based on their finding that a test for autocorrelation of the time series was not statistically significant. However, the lack of a control group is problematic in this study because of the simultaneous occurrence of two events that led to reductions in both vehicle miles traveled and traffic crashes during the study period: a national oil and gasoline shortage that occurred between 1973 and 1974, and a reduction in the national highway speed limit to 55 miles per hour in January 1974. Since the effects of these two events would have been universal throughout the United States, <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK> addressed this problem by using comparison communities that were matched on population size, population growth, geographic location, and urbanization in his analysis. Using analysis of variance techniques, with the ratio of ASAP fatalities divided by ASAP plus comparison fatalities as the dependent variable, he found no statistically significant differences between ASAP and comparison areas in year-to-year fluctuations in fatalities. We re-analyzed his raw data using mixed (between and within) ANOVAs and found similar results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK> also analyzed day and night fatalities from both ASAP and comparison groups, concluding that a decrease in the proportion of night-time fatal crashes was equally present in both ASAP and comparison areas. The actual night-time data he used were not tabled in his article and thus could not be re-analyzed. Zador concluded that there was no evidence of program effectiveness. The report by <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK> has been criticized for the use of total fatalities in major analyses: given that night-time fatal crashes were the focus of NHTSA's evaluation, the lack of power to detect a statistically significant difference, discrepancies in the data used between the 1974 DOT study and the Zador study, and the comparison areas chosen by Zador (Johnson 1976 under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>). These authors argued for the strength of the ITS design of the 1974 DOT report. Zador 1977 (under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>) responded that the use of comparison groups most often provides the stronger quasi-experimental design, especially if the comparison group is a good match as in his study. Levy 1978 (under <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1976</LINK>) subsequently evaluated data from all 35 ASAPs. The authors compared daytime to night-time traffic fatalities within ASAPs, and compared night-time traffic fatalities between ASAPs and 11 comparison sites. Each site was analyzed individually against one of the 11 comparison sites using Box-Tiao time series analysis and controlling for effects of the national fuel shortage and speed limit reduction. Using a one-tailed t-test, the analysis showed that 12 of the 35 sites had a statistically significant decrease in night-time traffic fatalities compared to comparison sites. The other 23 sites presumably had no statistically significant change, or an increase, but results were not reported. The directional t-test did not allow for the identification of significant increases in traffic fatalities at any of these sites because, according to the authors, "only a reduction in crashes would logically be considered an indication of project impact". This analysis can also be criticized for using the same control group for multiple comparisons without adjusting for the family-wise error rate, thus increasing the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. Based on all the available reports it is clear that a beneficial effect of the ASAPs on traffic fatalities was not demonstrated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2001</LINK> found a relative decrease in serious injuries (rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.13) with increased patrols.  There was also a reduction in minor injuries (rate ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07). <LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK> reported a minimal relative decrease with the intervention (rate ratio = 0.98) without statistical testing.</P>

<P>The majority of ITS analyses showed beneficial effects of the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Pigman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pigman 1984</LINK> reported a statistically significant mean reduction of 2.23 crashes per week (a 21% decrease). A time series regression of data from <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1984</LINK> revealed substantial decreases in both level (-227.5 crashes, P = 0.04) and slope (-38.2 crashes per quarter, P = 0.02). Two studies performed ITS analyses in addition to CBA analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Pigman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pigman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 2001</LINK>). Time series regression of data from <LINK REF="STD-Stuster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 2001</LINK> revealed a statistically significant reduction in crashes during the post-test period (-95.2 crashes per month, P = 0.002) and a similarly large, statistically significant decline in level. ARIMA results from <LINK REF="STD-Pigman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pigman 1988</LINK> revealed a 26.1% reduction in alcohol-related crashes during the post-test period (P &lt; 0.05; mean change not reported).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alcohol-impaired driving</HEADING>
<P>Prevention of alcohol-impaired driving is a likely mechanism for reduction in alcohol-related traffic injuries. Nine studies reported effects of increased patrols on alcohol-impaired driving (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maynard_x002d_Moody-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard-Moody 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>). Four studies found beneficial effects on alcohol-impaired driving (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK>), which were statistically significant in three cases (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK>). Four studies found a harmful effect (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard_x002d_Moody-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard-Moody 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>), which was statistically significant in one case (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard_x002d_Moody-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard-Moody 1986</LINK>); and one study reported 'no effect' without providing data (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Seven of these studies examined both alcohol-impaired driving and at least one selected outcome measure. Results for the two measures were consistent in three of the studies and inconsistent in terms of direction of effect in four cases. </P>
<P>Of the five studies where any beneficial effects on injuries or crashes were found, only two reported beneficial effects on alcohol-impaired driving. <LINK REF="STD-Voas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 1997</LINK> measured drunk driving using roadside breath tests in one intervention area, and reported a statistically significant decline in alcohol-impaired driving that coincided with the onset of the intervention.  In all three intervention areas, the number of days participants reported having driven after drinking too much declined 49% (95% CI -70% to -11%). In <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1986</LINK>, a nonsignificant reduction in self-reported alcohol-impaired driving was reported (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.50), although there was no apparent effect on impaired-driving events (data not reported).</P>
<P>In contrast, two studies showed adverse effects on alcohol-impaired driving despite beneficial effects on crash or injury outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK> examined two intervention areas using the same comparison area. In the first intervention area, where a reduction in injury crashes was observed, authors reported that there were no relative changes in alcohol-impaired driving (data not reported). In the other intervention area, where investigators found no beneficial effects of increased patrols on injuries or crashes, a nonsignificant increase in self-reported alcohol-impaired driving was observed (rate ratios at 6 and 12 months post-test: 1.89 and 1.05, respectively, 95% CIs could not be calculated). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard_x002d_Moody-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard-Moody 1986</LINK>), which reported significant reductions in both fatal and injury crashes, showed a significantly greater increase in alcohol-impaired driving in the intervention area relative to the comparison area (P = 0.048). A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>) found a significant reduction in injury crashes with intervention but no reported effect of the intervention on alcohol-impaired driving (although actual data were not reported for either measure). <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK> also reported no effect on total crashes or injuries in crashes.</P>
<P>The sixth study (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1988</LINK>) found no change in total alcohol-related crashes but a statistically significant relative decrease in the number of self-reported alcohol-impaired driving events with the intervention (rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89) and a smaller relative decrease in the number of people reporting alcohol-impaired driving in the past month (rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.24).</P>
<P>The seventh study that reported both alcohol-impaired driving and at least one selected outcome measure did not find any beneficial effects of the intervention on injuries or crashes (<LINK REF="STD-Lacey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 1987</LINK>). Consistent with this result there was a minimal increase in self-reported alcohol-impaired driving (rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.73) with intervention.</P>
<P>Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) did not collect any injury or crash outcome measures but did report effects of increased police patrols on alcohol-impaired driving. In their RCT, <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> found a modest relative increase in self-reported alcohol-impaired driving in the past month after the first weekend of enforcement (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.90) and a modest relative reduction after the last weekend of enforcement, which also included random breath tests and foot patrols (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.52). The CBA study by <LINK REF="STD-Marchetti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchetti 1995</LINK> showed a 1.4-fold increase in self-reported drunk driving in the intervention group and a nearly 4-fold increase in the control group; the increase for the control group was significantly greater (P = 0.019).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons between increased patrols and other interventions</HEADING>
<P>
<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stuster-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuster 1995</LINK>) included a comparison between increased patrols and another intervention (that is, sobriety checkpoints), where both interventions also included a media component. Although the two groups were not compared directly, results from each were similar, with statistically significant pre-post reductions in alcohol-related injury crashes in both the intervention area (18%) and the comparison areas (9% to 40%). The authors also reported a significant pre-post reduction in single vehicle total crashes with increased patrols but not with sobriety checkpoints (data were not reported).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We examined the effects of increased police patrols according to the presence or absence of other intervention elements such as media and education, special training, or sobriety checkpoints.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Increased police patrols alone</HEADING>
<P>Only four studies evaluated the effect of increased patrols in isolation. Three of these evaluated increased patrols alone (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) while one evaluated the added effect of increased patrols to other interventions that were implemented similarly in both intervention and control areas (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1984</LINK>). Two studies found greater pre-post reductions in the intervention versus comparison areas for all outcomes assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Mallory-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mallory 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1984</LINK>), ranging from 22% to 23% for fatalities and fatal crashes to 8% to 11% for total crashes, 4% for injury crashes, and 2% for injuries. None of these reductions were tested for statistical significance. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1981</LINK> reported 'no effect' of increased patrols alone on total crashes. The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) did not measure alcohol-related injury or crash outcomes.  Based on the few available studies, results for increased patrols alone appear to be consistent with the overall results of this review, that is, most studies reported beneficial effects on traffic fatalities and alcohol-related crashes or proxies for such crashes. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Increased police patrols with a media or public education component</HEADING>
<P>Because the majority of studies (84%) included analyses that evaluated increased police patrols combined with a paid or earned media or public information component, results from this subgroup were similar to that of the overall comparison. That is, increased patrols combined with a media or public information component resulted in reductions in total, fatal and injury crashes, and in traffic fatalities in the majority of studies (with imprecise effect estimates in a number of cases), and inconsistent effects on total and nonfatal traffic injuries. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> examined self-reported alcohol-impaired driving combined with both random breath testing and foot patrols at licensed premises and in town, and showed relative decreases in the intervention versus comparison areas that were not statistically significant (rate ratios for two survey questions on alcohol-impaired driving: 0.88 and 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.52 and 0.33 to 2.75, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Voas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Voas 2002</LINK> also implemented foot patrols at a border crossing with high pedestrian traffic and found a 45% reduction in the intervention area versus no change in the comparison area (data not provided, P &gt; 0.40). </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-05 17:14:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Principal finding</HEADING>
<P>Studies examining increased police patrols have, for the most part, reported beneficial effects on traffic fatalities and alcohol-related crashes or proxies for such crashes. However, two-thirds of the studies were rated as 'not adequate' on at least one key design or conduct feature, and almost none of the studies reported methodological information in sufficient detail to evaluate their quality fully. Inadequate sample size, dissimilarity of baseline measures for outcomes (for example, intervention areas selected for high alcohol-related crash rates), and contamination were among the more common design flaws. Hence, we conclude that existing evidence does not establish that increased police patrols reduce the adverse outcomes of alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
<P>In 1994, <LINK REF="REF-Zobeck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zobeck 1994</LINK> conducted a systematic review of increased police patrols, both alone and in combination with other enforcement programs or laws, and found small decreases in crashes and casualties. The authors noted then that many of the studies did not implement critical features of good research design and failed to report detailed results. Although our review excluded weaker study designs, like before-after studies, and added an additional decade of research literature our findings are generally consistent with those reported by <LINK REF="REF-Zobeck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zobeck 1994</LINK>. It is surprising that more high quality research studies evaluating increased police patrols have not been funded since the previous review, given that millions of dollars are spent annually to fund increased law enforcement activity targeting alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Supporting findings</HEADING>
<P>Decreases in fatal crashes and traffic fatalities were less likely to be statistically significant than other outcomes, a finding that may be explained by lack of power to detect changes in these infrequently occurring outcomes.</P>
<P>Effects on injuries showed the greatest variability. It is difficult to explain why nearly all studies that evaluated injury crashes reported decreases, whereas half of those that evaluated injuries did not. Data on injuries and injury crashes were acquired from the same types of sources, mainly accident reporting systems and police reports. However, the methods of counting injuries and injury crashes were not specified and, therefore, may have differed. In addition, none of the studies reported adjusting for clustering of injuries within crashes.</P>
<P>Only four of nine studies that measured alcohol-impaired driving, either by self-report or breath alcohol content, showed any reduction in this outcome with increased police patrols. Perhaps, surprisingly, decreases in crash and injury outcomes were not consistently associated with decreases in alcohol-impaired driving. Hence, our results do not necessarily support prevention of alcohol-impaired driving as a mechanism for any reduction in crashes and injuries observed with increased police patrols. However, relatively few studies measured alcohol-impaired driving in a manner consistent with our minimum design criteria. Hence it is not clear whether the lack of association is due to the inadequate methods used in most studies or to a true failure of increased police patrols to reduce alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Additional findings</HEADING>
<P>In general, increased patrols alone appeared to have effects on crashes and injuries similar to those of increased patrols implemented with adjuncts such as media, public education, special training and equipment, sobriety checkpoints, or other interventions. However, these findings are based on only a few studies since the vast majority of studies implemented media or public education, and often other adjuncts along with increased patrols. Media campaigns were implemented in the majority of studies, thus it is difficult to separate the effects of these intervention components. A systematic review of media campaigns for preventing alcohol-impaired driving (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 2004</LINK>) used different inclusion criteria but also found overlap between enforcement efforts and media campaigns, although enforcement efforts other than increased patrols were implemented. Our results suggest, based on limited evidence, that increased patrols combined with sobriety checkpoints do not show a greater benefit than increased patrols without such checkpoints. Only a few studies evaluated foot patrols, public advocacy, citizen reporting of DUI, or coordination with judicial processes and their results were not entirely consistent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and weaknesses</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Identification of studies</HEADING>
<P>To minimize selection bias, we attempted to be as comprehensive as possible in seeking eligible studies by searching diverse databases, employing free-text search terms, searching English and non-English language literature, and excluding methodological terms from our search strategy (since consistent terminology to identify study designs other than controlled trials is lacking). Nevertheless, eligible reports may have been missed. We did not use website searches, through which others have identified road safety interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Aeron_x002d_Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aeron-Thomas 2005</LINK>). Although the fact that most included studies were from the United States is consistent with observations that behaviorally-based field assessment of impairment is primarily used in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Voas-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 1991</LINK>), it is also possible that the selected search terms introduced language bias. In addition, since increased police patrols are a common practice in the United States, it is likely that many programs have been implemented without evaluation, or that evaluations may have gone unreported unless beneficial effects were observed. Finally, since all identified studies took place in high income countries, the results of this review may not be generalizable to low and middle income countries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>ITS, CBA, and CITS study designs are considered stronger methodologically than before-after and post-test only designs (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1979</LINK>) and such designs are likely to be the best available evidence about population-based interventions in natural settings, where true experimental designs are difficult to implement. As expected, almost all programs were evaluated with CBA, ITS, or CITS designs. Inclusion of quasi-experimental designs, however, introduces concerns about validity. Two-thirds of the studies we identified had at least one methodological limitation that could affect the validity of our results, while only one study was 'adequate' on all criteria. CITS studies were generally of higher quality and more likely to earn ratings of 'adequate' than were either CBA or ITS studies, although the quality of ITS studies was improved by our re-analyses. Overall methodological quality of the review could have been improved by applying more stringent inclusion criteria for these study designs, such as better matching on CBAs or more data points for ITS designs.</P>
<P>Methodology was rarely reported in sufficient detail for adequate quality assessment, which prevented our stratifying findings by study quality. Dissimilarity of baseline measures for outcomes (for example, intervention areas selected for high alcohol-related crash rates) and contamination, which we found in many studies, have been identified as key quality criteria in other reviews pertaining to traffic safety (<LINK REF="REF-Bunn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aeron_x002d_Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aeron-Thomas 2005</LINK>). The failure of many studies to report on such issues could have biased our conclusions. Other reviewers have noted a slight improvement in quality ratings when information from authors was obtained (<LINK REF="REF-Liberati-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberati 1986</LINK>). Although several authors were deceased, untraceable, or did not respond, we did obtain additional methodological information from a number of authors, improving our ability to identify indicators of quality.</P>
<P>Another potential source of bias lies in selective reporting of outcomes (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>) in which authors do not completely report examined outcomes or do not report all outcomes collected. In our review, outcome data were often reported incompletely so that quantitative combination of results in a meta-analysis was not feasible. Only one author who replied to our requests for additional information indicated that he had collected an outcome that was not reported in his study, although not all authors could be contacted. On the other hand, many of the authors reported their results in lengthy, detailed technical reports, which are perhaps more likely to have included all measured outcomes than are, for example, in shorter journal articles.</P>
<P>Almost all included studies examined at least one primary outcome. However, most injury and crash outcomes were measured either directly or indirectly from police records. Knowledge of the intervention by police could have biased outcome assessment, although it is difficult to know the direction of any bias. Police officers in intervention communities often received additional training in the recognition of alcohol-impaired driving, which could increase identification and reporting of alcohol-related incidents (<LINK REF="STD-Amick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Amick 1984</LINK>). On the other hand, desire to demonstrate effectiveness of the intervention program could lead to under-reporting of alcohol-related incidents. <LINK REF="REF-Waller-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waller 1986</LINK> found no systematic bias in police assessment of alcohol use, although this study was not conducted in the context of an intervention involving police. Our within-study comparison of alcohol-related crashes and highly associated proxies for alcohol-related crashes showed that these outcomes generally showed the same direction of effect and statistical significance (or lack of) and comparable magnitude of effect, demonstrating no evidence of systematic bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>One strength of this review is that we examined both immediate (change in level) and sustained (change in slope) effects of increased police patrols in our re-analyses of ITS designs. These analyses allowed us to assess whether there were consistent differences in immediate versus sustained effects of increased patrols on injuries or crashes. A number of studies did show differences in the direction of change in level versus change in slope, but these differences were not consistent as some studies had immediate but not sustained beneficial effects on outcomes, while others showed the opposite result.</P>
<P>Several CITS studies failed to test the differential change over time between intervention and comparison areas, which would have been helpful in determining relative effects of increased police patrols. However, potential problems with interpreting times series involving ratios of study events to comparison events have been noted (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1995b</LINK>). We preferentially selected ARIMA analyses when authors performed them. However, most ARIMA analyses examined pre-post changes within groups without considering relative effects.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-03 12:00:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found many studies of increased police patrol programs, which in general showed at least some beneficial effect on fatalities and crashes although few results were statistically significant. The most consistent benefits were seen for total crashes, fatalities and fatal crashes. However, nearly three-quarters of the studies had at least one methodological limitation which could affect their results. Evidence about whether prevention of alcohol-impaired driving is a mechanism for the decrease in crashes and injuries that is observed with increased police patrols is also inconclusive. Thus, existing evidence, although suggestive, does not establish whether increased police patrols, implemented with or without other intervention elements, has an important effect on the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-08 14:42:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although increased police patrols appeared to reduce alcohol-related crashes and traffic fatalities in the identified studies, the quality and reporting of these studies was often poor. Methodologically rigorous research is still needed to evaluate whether increased police patrols are an effective intervention for targeting alcohol-impaired driving. The identification of one relatively good quality randomized controlled trial suggests that studies of better design and quality can and should be implemented to evaluate increased police patrols, even though the studies must occur in a natural setting. The need for high quality evaluation is particularly vital in the context of the substantial resources currently being expended to implement this intervention, despite its unproven efficacy. </P>
<P>Additional directions for future research might include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Direct comparisons of enforcement strategies (sobriety checkpoints, increased patrols, random breath testing or behavior-based versus chemistry-based enforcement).</LI>
<LI>Examination of specific additional interventional elements that may influence the effectiveness of increased police patrols.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation of objective measurements of alcohol-impaired driving during increased police patrol interventions using controlled study designs.</LI>
<LI>Determination of the cost-effectiveness of increased police patrol programs relative to other programs shown to reduce alcohol-impaired driving or its consequences.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Updates to this review will incorporate studies identified but not yet assessed and attempt to identify additional relevant literature.</P>

<BR/>Author measured differences between areas in self-reported drinking and driving using Chi-square test for independence. Follow up rates were 79% for the first survey wave and 65% for the second wave. For all comparisons, only respondents who participated in pretest and posttest surveys were included. Author found that drink driving behaviors did not change significantly following the intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">RCTs, CTs, CBAs</HEADING>
<P>The criteria were as follows:</P>
<P>1. Concealment of allocation (RCTs and CTs only)</P>
<P>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>unit of allocation was by site and any random process was described explicitly, e.g. the use of random number tables or coin flips, OR,</LI>
<LI>unit of allocation was by participant and the study used some form of centralized randomization scheme, an on-site computer system or sealed opaque envelopes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>authors assigned participants to groups by case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week, alternation or any other such approach OR</LI>
<LI>unit of allocation was by participant and authors report using any allocation process that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as open list of random numbers or assignments OR</LI>
<LI>allocation was altered by investigators, police, government officials, or participants</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Similarity of baseline outcomes</P>
<P>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>outcomes were measured prior to intervention and no substantial differences were present across study groups.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>baseline differences in outcome measures were present and likely to undermine post intervention differences</LI>
</UL>
<P>3. Similarity of other baseline characteristics (CBAs only)</P>
<P>Adequate:</P>
<UL>
<LI>specific characteristics were shown in figures or tables to be similar OR</LI>
<LI>specific characteristics were stated to be similar OR</LI>
<LI>sites were reported to have been matched or selected based on similar characteristics.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>characteristics were stated as different or shown in tables or figures to be different, or populations were evidently different (e.g., a city was compared to the rest of the state).</LI>
</UL>
<P>4. Protection against contamination </P>
<P>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>allocation was by community and it is unlikely that the control received the intervention due to separation by geography, time, or other factor.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the control likely received the intervention (e.g., increased police patrols also operated in comparison area or comparison and intervention areas overlapped).</LI>
</UL>
<P>5. Follow-up of participants</P>
<P>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>outcome measures were obtained for 80-100% of participants assigned to groups. This criterion was not applied to studies that assessed outcomes on population cross-sections.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ITS</HEADING>
<P>The criteria used to assess ITS were as follows:</P>
<P>1. Protection against secular changes<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>authors made compelling arguments that intervention occurred independently of other changes over time and outcome was not influenced by other confounding variables/historic events during study period.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Appropriate analysis of data<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>ARIMA models were used OR</LI>
<LI>time series regression models were used to analyze data and serial correlation was adjusted/tested for OR</LI>
<LI>reanalysis (See Data Analyses) was performed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>3. Reasons for number of data points given<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>data for 12 months (or more) pre- and post-intervention were used and data points were at least monthly OR</LI>
<LI>reason for number and spacing of data points was given OR</LI>
<LI>sample size calculation was performed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>4. Shape of the intervention effect pre-specified<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>point of analysis or re-analysis was point of intervention OR</LI>
<LI>rational explanation for shape of intervention effect was given by author(s), including explanation if point of analysis was not point of intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>5. Intervention unlikely to affect data collection (protection against detection bias)<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>authors report that intervention itself was unlikely to affect data collection (for example, sources and methods of data collection were the same before and after intervention).</LI>
</UL>
<P>6. Completeness of data set<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>data set covered 80-100% of all study participants. This criterion was not applied to studies that assessed outcomes on population cross-sections.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">CITS</HEADING>
<P>Quality for CITS studies was assessed using all criteria for both ITS and CBA studies, with two exceptions:</P>
<P>1. Protection against secular changes<BR/>Not adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>authors report that comparison group did not control for other changes over time.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not applicable:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all other CITS studies, because the presence of a comparison group generally addresses sources of invalidity (e.g., history effects) that single-group ITS designs fail to address.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Appropriate analysis of data<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were used OR time series regression models were used to analyze data and serial correlation was adjusted/test</LI>
</UL>
<P>Not applicable:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all other CITS studies (because they could also be analyzed like CBAs).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">All Designs</HEADING>
<P>For all types of designs, the following additional criteria were assessed:</P>
<P>1. Blinded assessment of primary outcome(s) (protection against detection bias)<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>authors stated explicitly that primary outcome variables were assessed blindly OR</LI>
<LI>outcome variables were objective, e.g. alcohol levels as assessed by blood test.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Reliable primary outcome measure(s)<BR/>Adequate:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>two or more raters with at least 90% agreement or kappa greater than or equal to 0.8 OR</LI>
<LI>outcome was obtained from automated system, e.g. length of hospital stay from administrative records, alcohol levels as assessed by a blood test.</LI>
