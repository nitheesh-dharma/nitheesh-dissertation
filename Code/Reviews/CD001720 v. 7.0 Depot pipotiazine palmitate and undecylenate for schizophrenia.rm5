<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>We undertook this review to determine the effects of pipotiazine palmitate for schizophrenia in comparison to placebo, other oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotics. We included results of 12 medium term trials, two long term trials, three short term trials and one trial that looked at immediate effects. We found that depot pipotiazine is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia, but overall was similar in effect to other depots and oral typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally but compliance may be problematic. The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to their extensive use as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Pipotiazine palmitate is a depot from the phenothiazine family of antipsychotic drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the clinical, social and economic effects of depot pipotiazine palmitate and undecylenate compared with placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>For this update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2003). We also inspected references of all identified trials for more studies and contacted relevant industries.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials comparing depot pipotiazine palmitate and undecylenate to oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations for people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected, quality rated and independently extracted data from relevant studies. We calculated the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where possible the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). We only presented scale data for those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>When pipotiazine palmitate was compared with 'standard' oral antipsychotic no differences were found for outcomes of global impression (n=53, 1 RCT, RR 2.57, CI 0.8 to 8.6), relapse (n=124, 1 RCT, RR 1.55 CI 0.76 to 3.2), study attrition (n=219, 3 RCTs, RR 1.37 CI 0.8 to 2.4) and behaviour (n=124, 1 RCT, WMD 4.65, CI -1.1 to 10.4). There was also no reported difference in adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia or the need for anticholinergic drugs.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Sixteen studies compared pipotiazine palmitate with other depot preparations (n=1123). Pipotiazine palmitate was consistently equivalent to other depots in terms of a range of outcomes, including global impression (n=217, 4 RCTs, RR not improved 0.99 CI 0.91 to 1.07), relapse (n=239, 5 RCTs, RR relapse by 1 year 0.98 CI 0.55 to 1.75), and adverse effects (n=337, 5 RCTs, RR needing anticholinergic medication 0.98 CI 0.84 to 1.15).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although well-conducted and reported randomised trials are still needed to fully inform practice (no trial data exists reporting hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care and economics) pipotiazine palmitate is a viable choice for both clinician and recipient of care.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 13:56:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>One in every 10,000 people per year is diagnosed with schizophrenia, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). This illness often runs a chronic course with acute exacerbations and frequent partial remissions. Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for this illness (<LINK REF="REF-Dencker-1980b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dencker 1980b</LINK>). These are generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling such symptoms as hallucinations and fixed false beliefs (delusions) (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>). They seem to reduce the risk of acute relapse. A systematic review undertaken over a decade ago suggested that, for those with serious mental illness, stopping antipsychotics resulted in 58% of people relapsing, whereas only 16% of those who were still on the drugs became acutely ill within a one year period (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1986</LINK>). Evidence also points to the fact that experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia lowers a person's level of social functioning and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Curson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curson 1985</LINK>). Relapse prevention also has enormous financial implications. For example, within the UK, a Department of Health burden of disease analysis in 1996 indicated that schizophrenia accounted for 5.4% of all National Heath Service in-patient expenditure, placing it behind only learning disability and stroke in magnitude (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Aaes_x002d_Jorgenson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaes-Jorgenson 1985</LINK>) but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. Problems with treatment adherence are common throughout medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979</LINK>). Those who suffer from long term illnesses such as schizophrenia where the treatments may have uncomfortable side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>) and individuals have cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-David-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1994</LINK>) and erosion of insight, are especially prone not to take medication on a regular basis. The development of depot injections in the 1960s and initial clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1973</LINK>) gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Depots mainly consist of an ester of the active drug held in an oily suspension. This is injected intramuscularly and is slowly released. Depots may be given every one to six weeks. Individuals may be maintained in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses, sometimes in clinics set up for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review of pipotiazine esters is one in a series investigating the effects of all depot antipsychotic preparations. The prevalence of use of the pipotiazine depots remains unknown despite contact with the company producing this preparation. We would welcome any information relating to the use of depot pipotiazine.</P>
<P>Technical background of Pipotiazine<BR/>Pipotiazine (previous nomenclature Pipothiazine) is from the phenothiazine family and has a piperidine side chain. It is also known as 10-[3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidino]propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-phenothiazine-2-sulfonamide, pipotiazine, piportil and piportil Spécia. Its depot forms can be known as piportil longum-4 (palmitate ester), piportyl palmitat, piportil depot (palmitate), lonseren (palmitate), piportil L 4 (palmitate ester), 19.552 RP, and piportil M 2 (undecylenate ester), 19.551 RP. Pipotiazine is a dopamine antagonist. Intervals between successive administrations of the palmitate depot are about four weeks, with peak levels after approximately two weeks. The undecylenate depot is no longer available (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1993</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a study was described as 'double-blind' and it was implied that the study was randomised, and where the demographic details of each group's participants were similar, trials were included. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants included people with schizophrenia or other similar psychotic disorders, diagnosed by any criteria, irrespective of gender, age or nationality. We included trials where a study described the participant group as suffering from 'serious mental illnesses' and did not give a particular diagnostic grouping. The exception to this rule was when the majority of those randomised clearly did not have a functional non-affective psychotic illness.</P>

<P>1. Reference searching<BR/>We also inspected the references of all identified trials for more studies. We sought each of the included studies as a citation on the SCISEARCH database. We inspected reports of articles that had cited these studies in order to identify further trials.</P>
<P>2. Personal contact<BR/>We contacted the first author of each included studyfor information regarding unpublished trials.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Drug companies<BR/>We also contacted companies producing depots for published and unpublished trials.</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Study selection<BR/>The principle reviewer, David Anthony, (inspected all identified citations or studies. A randomly selected sample of 10% of all reports was re-inspected by the secondary reviewer, Seema Quraishi, in order to ensure selection was reliable. Where disagreement occurred we resolved this by discussion, or where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we independently decided whether they met the review criteria. If disagreement occurred, again we attempted to resolve this by discussion and when this was not possible sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment. For the update MD inspected all identified citations or studies.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible, and further information was necessary, we did not enter data into the analyses and assigned the study to the list of those awaiting assessment. We only included trials in Category A or B in the review.</P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We each independently extracted data. When further clarification was needed, we contacted the authors of trials to provide missing data. When disputes arose we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter the data but added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis <BR/>Where more than 30% of those randomised were lost to follow-up by six months, or 50% by beyond six moths, we felt that data were too prone to bias to use and did not report the findings. We presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. We assumed that all those who were lost to follow up had the negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of relapse, those who were lost to follow up all relapsed.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the random effects risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We also calculated the weighted number needed to treat statistic (NNT), and its 95% confidence interval (CI). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again, if heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or are ad hoc. We included continuous data from rating scales only if: (a) the psychometric properties of the instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) the instrument is either: (¡) a self report, or (¡¡) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). Unpublished instruments are frequently employed and are more likely to represent statistically significant findings than those that have been put into print (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcome then we reported only the former in this review.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Test for inconsistency<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then visually inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, this was interpreted as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Data were then re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, and results became more consistent, falling below 75% in the estimate, we added the studies to the main body of trials. If using the random effects model did not make a difference and inconsistency remained high, data were not summated, but were presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated. (This paragraph has been reworded for the update of 2003 taking into account new developments in software and statistics.)</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to identify the likelihood of significant publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the treatment depots.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive description of studies please see Included and Excluded studies table.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded 31 studies from the review. Twenty three studies were excluded as they were not randomised trials. Five were excluded as the interventions were different from focus of this review. Three studies were excluded as they did not have any usable data. In the latter case we contacted authors requesting raw data, for most of these we have not yet received any replies.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>No studies are awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We are not aware of any ongoing studies.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified 18 studies for inclusion, four of which are seen for the first time in this update (June2003). Two of these studies were awaiting assessment in previous versions of this review and two (<LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK>) we found in the latest update search. All included studies were randomised. </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Depot preparation has a slow absorption and long duration of action. Twelve of the included studies were of medium term duration (6-12 months), two studies had a long-term duration of more than a year, and three had short term durations of between six weeks to five months. One study lasting 22 days (<LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1986</LINK>) looked at immediate effects.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>All participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Only six studies included participants with operationalised diagnoses by RDC, ICD9 or DSM II. Most of the studies included people of both sexes although two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1985</LINK>) used all male participants. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schlosberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schlosberg 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1981</LINK>) failed to mention the sex of participants. Ages ranged between 18 and 75 years and the majority had a long history of illness. </P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK>) used participants from both hospital and community settings and four failed to mention the setting used (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schlosberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schlosberg 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1986</LINK>). Five studies <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Robak-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Robak 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Woggon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Woggon 1977</LINK> were conducted in the community and six studies <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Robak-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Robak 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK>
<LINK REF="STD-Yan_x002d_hua-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yan-hua 1993</LINK> took place in a hospital setting. </P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> was the largest study (209 participants) while <LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK> randomised only 26 people. Nine trials had fewer than 50 participants, six had 50 to 100participants and three included more than 100 people. </P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>The dose of pipotiazine administered ranged widely from 25 mg/IM monthly to 250 mg IM twice weekly. Three trials compared pipotiazine palmitate with oral antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Robak-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Robak 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1986</LINK>). Fourteen studies compared pipotiazine palmitate to another depot, and one used the pipotiazine undecylenate ester as an intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes <BR/>Many of the trials presented their findings in graphs or by p-values alone. Graphical presentation made it impossible to acquire raw data for synthesis. Requests for raw data from authors have so far failed. It was also common to use p-values as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association. </P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales<BR/>The scales listed below were commonly used to measure outcomes:</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state scales<BR/>4.6.1.1.1 Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI is a three-item scale commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. The items are: severity of illness; global improvement and efficacy index. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Mental state scales <BR/>4.6.1.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has sixteen items, but a revised eighteen-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from 0-126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.2 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This scale allows a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia (impoverished thinking), affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Assessments are made on a six-point scale (0=not at all to 5=severe). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptoms.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.3 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>) <BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking. Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.4 The Hamilton rating scale for depression - HRSD (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>)<BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on those patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of a depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five-point or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. A score of 11 is generally regarded as indicative of a diagnosis of depression.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Behavioural rating scales<BR/>4.6.1.3.1 Nurses Observational Scale of Inpatients Evaluation - NOSIE (<LINK REF="REF-Honigfeld-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honigfeld 1965</LINK>)<BR/>This is an 80-item scale with items rated on a five-point scale from zero (not present) to four (always present). Ratings are based on the participants behaviour over the previous three days. The seven headings are social competence, social interest, personal neatness, cooperation, irritability, manifest psychosis and psychotic depression. The total score ranges from 0-320 with high scores indicating a poor outcome.</P>
<P>4.6.1.4 Adverse effects scales<BR/>4.6.1.4.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Side Effects Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale has been used to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dyskinesia and chronic akathisia, as well as 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term, drug-induced movement disorder. However, using this scale in short-term trials may also be helpful to assess some rapidly occurring abnormal movement disorders such as tremor. Scoring consists of rating movement severity in the anatomical areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk) on a five point scale (0=none, 4=severe).</P>
<P>4.6.1.4.2 Bordeleau Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Bordeleau-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordeleau 1967</LINK>)<BR/>This is a rating scale for extrapyramidal symptoms. We are currently seeking a fuller description of this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.4.3 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS/EPS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. Each item is rated on a seven point scale. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>4.6.1.4.4 Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>) <BR/>The SAS is a 10-item scale used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptomatology. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism.</P>
<P>4.6.1.4.5 Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale/Form (TESS/F) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>). <BR/>This checklist assesses a variety of characteristics for each adverse event, including severity, relationship to the drug, temporal characteristics (timing after a dose, duration and pattern during the day), contributing factors, course, and action taken to counteract the effect. Symptoms can be listed a priori or can be recorded as observed by the investigator.</P>
<P>4.6.1.5 Missing outcomes.<BR/>None of the studies evaluated hospital/service outcomes, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>No study specified the process of random allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1985</LINK> did state that allocation was stratified by schizophrenia subgroups. As poor reporting of randomisation has consistently been associated with an overestimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>) all allocation concealment has been rated as 'unclear' or quality 'B'. The results in these trials are likely to be a 30-40% overestimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>All but four studies were described as 'double blind': <LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK> described the trial as being partially blinded, <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> described the trial as open, <LINK REF="STD-Robak-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Robak 1973</LINK> failed to mention if conditions were double blind or not. Of those authors who stated a double blind procedure was undertaken, none reported this being tested. Two questions, one to the participant - "what do you think you have been given?" and one to the rater - "what drug do you think this person was allocated?" would have clarified the situation. Failure to test double blinding may cast doubt on the quality of trial data. Scale data, as was often measured in the included studies, may be prone to bias when unblinding has taken place. </P>
<P>3. Loss to follow-up<BR/>Two studies had high drop rates. <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1978</LINK> lost 46% of people by one year (63% of the pipotiazine group). Reasons for withdrawal were well described (side effects, shifts to other medications, moving to another place and refused to continue medication). <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1981</LINK> reported 42% loss at one year on. No reasons for withdrawal were given. Apart from the outcome of 'leaving the study early' data from these trials were not entered into the analysis.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>COMPARISON 1. PIPOTIAZINE PALMITATE versus TYPICAL ORAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS</P>
<P>1. Mental state<BR/>No difference between those on depot medication and those allocated oral antipsychotics was found for the outcome of relapse at 18 months (n=124, 1 RCT, RR 1.55 CI 0.8 to 3.2). Rating scale scores of mental state (BPRS) at 18 months supported this finding (WMD -2.36 CI -7.2 to 2.4). BPRS data for the immediate term 22 days was also equivocal.</P>
<P>2. Leaving the study early<BR/>Almost 20% of people taking pipotiazine left the study early (22/112) compared to 14% on the control group, but there were no apparent differences between the groups (n=219, 3 RCTs, RR 1.37 CI 0.77 to 2.44). </P>
<P>3. Behaviour<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK> reported behaviour rating scale scores (NOSIE) at 18 months. Ratings were similar for people allocated pipotiazine decanoate and those given oral antipsychotic (n=124, WMD 4.65 CI -1.1 to 10.4).</P>
<P>4. Global impression: No important clinical response<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1986</LINK> eight out of 27 people in the group allocated to pipotiazine showed no change while three out of 26 in the control group showed no change (n=53, RR 2.57 CI 0.8 to 8.6).</P>
<P>5. Adverse effects<BR/>The number of people needing anticholinergic drugs for unspecified reasons was no different between those taking the depot and those allocated to standard antipsychotic drugs . The incidence of tardive dyskinesia was comparable between groups at the end of 18 months. The extrapyramidal adverse effects of dystonia, stiff gate and tremor were similar for pipotiazine and oral antipsychotics. </P>
<P>COMPARISON 2. PIPOTIAZINE PALMITATE versus OTHER DEPOT PREPARATIONS</P>
<P>1. Global impression<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK>, n=60) reported the rate of 'severe illness' (the majority in both groups) and found no difference between pipotiazine palmitate and fluphenazine decanoate (RR 0.97, CI 0.86 to 1.08). Four studies reported on 'no important global change' and again no significant difference was seen between pipotiazine palmitate and fluphenazine decanoate (n=217, RR 0.99 CI 0.9 to 1.1). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1978</LINK>) reported that fewer people (p=0.06) in the other depot group required additional antipsychotics (RR 1.91 CI 0.97 to 3.8) compared to those in the pipotiazine palmitate group. Global impression scores were found to significantly favour pipotiazine palmitate when compared to fluphenazine decanoate in <LINK REF="STD-Schlosberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schlosberg 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> (n=220, WMD -0.35 CI -0.6 to -0.1). When severity of illness was compared at the end of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> it was found to be significantly reduced in the pipotiazine group (n=209, WMD -0.50, CI -0.8 to -0.2).</P>
<P>2. Mental state<BR/>Seven studies found no differences in relapse rates between those allocated pipotiazine palmitate and those on other depots (n=417, RR 0.97 Cl 0.7 to 1.4). Dichotomised BPRS scores from <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK> also reported no difference between the groups (n=67, RR 1.09 CI 0.7 to 1.7) at a cut-off of 'severely ill'. This was supported by summated BPRS endpoint scores from three trials (n=368, WMD -1.41 CI -2.9 to 0.1). Mental state scores of depression showed no difference (n=97, RR 0.89 CI 0.7 to 1.1). In this update dichotomised BPRS reported by <LINK REF="STD-Yan_x002d_hua-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yan-hua 1993</LINK> was equivocal (n=102, RR 1.18, CI 0.8 to 1.8). <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> assessed symptoms using SANS and SAPS and reported a significant reduction in symptoms for the pipotiazine group, but data were skewed and are not reported graphically. </P>
<P>3. Leaving the study early<BR/>Eleven studies found no significant difference between those randomised to pipotiazine palmitate or the other depot group (n=608, RR 1.38 CI 1.0 to 1.8) but these were heterogeneous data (Chi square 18.36, df=10).</P>
<P>4. Adverse effects<BR/>No differences between depots were reported for 'general' adverse effects (n=157, RR 0.80 CI 0.6 to 1.0). The prevalence of movement disorders was similar between groups, as was that of parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia and tremor. Six studies reported no significant difference in the number of people requiring anticholinergic medication, but the reasons for its use was unspecified. Blurred vision and dry mouth was equally present in both groups. <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> assessed adverse effects using the SAS and TESS scales and found low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects in the pipotiazine group, but data were skewed and are not reported graphically.</P>
<P>COMPARISON 3. PIPOTIAZINE UNDECYLENATE versus FLUSPIRILENE( <LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK>)</P>
<P>There was only one study comparing pipotiazine undecylenate with other antipsychotics. There were no data on global impression, mental state or behavioural outcomes in this small short study (n=26, duration 11 weeks).</P>
<P>1. Leaving the study early<BR/>No people left the study from either group by the 11 weeks.</P>
<P>2. Adverse effects<BR/>The study found no differences in rates of movement disorders between pipotiazine undecylenate and fluspirilene (RR 1.00 CI 0.1 to 14.3). Parkinsonism was comparable between groups (RR 1.00 CI 0.1 to 14.3) and as was the rate of needing anticholinergic drugs (RR 1.67 CI 0.9 to 3.2).</P>
<P>3. Missing outcomes<BR/>No study reported on hospital and service outcomes or commented on participants' overall satisfaction during or after the trial. No included trial reported economic outcomes.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of results<BR/>Diagnoses were based on varied criteria (DSM II, DSM III, French classification of mental illness, ICD-9, RDC) but ten out of the 18 included trials did not specify which diagnostic criteria were used. The failure of studies to report the tool used to diagnose schizophrenia, and differences in criteria used, suggests that diagnoses could be heterogeneous. This heterogeneity should increase external validity of the findings of this review. Where a description was available (8/18 trials) participants had long histories of schizophrenia (duration of illness ranged from &lt;1-34 years) and most were in hospital. All trials evaluated doses of depot pipotiazine that would be used in the 'real world'. </P>
<P>Compliance is currently a major concern in modern-day treatments of schizophrenia. Observing the effect of oral and depot antipsychotic drugs in terms of clinical efficacy, adverse effects and social implications has a wide role to play in constructing a sound basis for the choice the clinician makes when prescribing medication. The main benefit of depot formulations is that covert non-compliance is eliminated and if relapse does occur under these circumstances then non-compliance can be ruled out. Those entering clinical trials, however, are usually reasonably compliant people. This must always compromise the applicability of the results of trials of depot preparations to the real community, where non-compliance or failure to turn up to depot clinics is commonplace.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1. PIPOTIAZINE PALMITATE versus ORAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS<BR/>2.1 All outcomes<BR/>There was no difference between pipotiazine palmitate and 'standard antipsychotics' for any of the outcomes. These included measures of relapse, mental state (endpoint BPRS), leaving the study early, behaviour (endpoint NOSIE score) and adverse effects. Currently there is no trial-based evidence that pipotiazine has any advantages, or drawbacks, when compared to oral drugs. </P>
<P>Bearing in mind the issues of generalisability discussed above, and the likely minimisation of covert non-compliance associated with oral antipsychotic medication within trials, the use of a depot preparation in the 'real world' seems attractive. If by prescribing depots, covert non-compliance would be resolved, and relapse and mental state treated as effectively as by oral medication, this is important. It needs to be ascertained however, whether the use of this depot would affect a person's performance in other areas of functioning, such as social behaviour, life skills or cognitive capacity to a greater or lesser extent than oral antipsychotics.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. PIPOTIAZINE PALMITATE versus OTHER DEPOT PREPARATIONS<BR/>Sixteen studies (n=1123, duration 12 weeks to three years) compared pipotiazine palmitate with other depots. In comparison to other depot preparations pipotiazine palmitate is well researched within trials.</P>
<P>3.1 Global impression<BR/>Improvement was rare and no different for those allocated to pipotiazine palmitate or fluphenazine decanoate (the comparator in all three trials that provided data for this result). The participants in these studies were, for the most part, extremely ill, and it may be asking a great deal of any treatment to have much of an effect on those whose illnesses were so entrenched. Additional antipsychotics were required in the pipotiazine palmitate group more frequently than for those allocated other depots. This could suggest that the dosage of pipotiazine palmitate was too low in the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bechelli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bechelli 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1978</LINK>, range 25 mg/IM/month - 150 mg/IM/month). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schlosberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schlosberg 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK>) provide Clinical Global Impression endpoint scores favouring pipotiazine palmitate over fluphenazine decanoate. As with many continuous outcomes, it is difficult to interpret these data. </P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>There was no difference in the number of people relapsing between pipotiazine palmitate and other depots (n=417, about 15% in both groups by one year). Dichotomous and continuous BPRS scores and depression scores also reported no difference between groups. These are the most convincing and consistent results in this review and suggest no difference between depot preparations. <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> showed reduction in scores for positive and negative symptoms using SANS and SAPS. The SD for these scores were high and so we did not include these in the final analysis. </P>
<P>3.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Twenty three percent of participants left the studies before completion (by about one year). There were no differences between groups. In this update two more studies were added (<LINK REF="STD-Woggon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Woggon 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yan_x002d_hua-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yan-hua 1993</LINK>). Adding these data did not result in any substantive changes.</P>
<P>3.4 Adverse effects<BR/>Pipotiazine palmitate causes a range of adverse effects, but no more frequently than other depot preparations. At least one third of people given pipotiazine palmitate will develop movement disorders and approaching 60% will be prescribed anticholinergic medication. Again, these findings are largely based on a greater total number of trial participants than has been seen in other depot reviews. <LINK REF="STD-Chai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chai 1998</LINK> used the TESS and SAS scales to look at side effects. Though they showed a better outcome for the pipotiazine group, the data were skewed and therefore not included in the final analysis.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 3. PIPOTIAZINE UNDECYLENATE versus FLUSPIRILENE<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK> (n=26, duration 11 weeks) compared this pipotiazine ester with fluspirilene. </P>
<P>4.1 All outcomes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vereecken-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vereecken 1972</LINK> was an unusual trial in that no data for global impression or mental state were reported. No one left the study before completion. There were no discernible differences in adverse effects of movement disorders, parkinsonism or in the requirement for anticholinergic medication. All findings are based on very small numbers. </P>
<P>According to an industry-based register of antipsychotic drugs (http://www.psychiatrylink.com/PsychotropicsDatabase/default.htm) accessed in May 1999, the undecylenate depot ester of pipotiazine is no longer used in clinical practice.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For clinicians<BR/>Currently, considerable trial-based data suggests that pipotiazine palmitate is neither better nor worse than other depot preparations. These data should assist the process of deciding which depot to give and personal preference, clinical judgement and accessibility must also play a major part. These trials do not inform clinicians if pipotiazine palmitate has advantages or drawbacks over oral antipsychotics.</P>
<P>2. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Pipotiazine palmitate is a well-researched depot. No convincing differences are evident when comparing the pipotiazine esters with oral antipsychotic drugs or with other depot formulations. There are no discernible differences, illustrated within clinical trials, between the different depots in terms of clinical improvement, acceptability of treatment, or severity of adverse effects. This does not mean that real differences do not exist but the numbers in the pipotiazine palmitate versus other depot comparisons were reasonably large. Currently choices to receive depot or not could be based on personal preference as could the decision regarding which depot to take.</P>
<P>3. For managers or policy makers<BR/>No direct data on hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care and economics were available. If depot formulations do promote compliance and this leads to a reduction in relapses, this would have important implications for patients and the services that care for them. Any suggestion that pipotiazine palmitate reduces relapse and hospital care is not based on trial data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been anticipated by trialists much more data would have been available. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid and gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to the minimum. Well-described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. It is also important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn, in order to evaluate exclusion bias. It would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner which reflected association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risk, odds-ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If p-values are used, the exact value should be reported.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>In comparison to other depot antipsychotics, the effects of pipotiazine palmitate have been well investigated within trials. Nevertheless, there are no data on service use, social and cognitive functioning, satisfaction with care and economics. Depending on the prevalence of use - and this information has, at the time of writing, been impossible to find - more trials are needed to finally, fully evaluate this potent drug preparation. Well-planned, conducted and reported 'real world' clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1995</LINK>) would overcome some of the problems of applicability of the data presented in this review.</P>
