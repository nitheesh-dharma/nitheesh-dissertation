<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-11 17:01:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Why do older people suffer bone fractures?</B>
</P>
<P>Hip fractures and several other types of fractures are very common in post-menopausal women and older men due to age-related weakening of their bones (osteoporosis).</P>
<P>
<B>What is the impact of bone fractures in older people?</B>
</P>
<P>Fractures due to osteoporosis often occur in the hip, wrist or spine and can lead to considerable disability or even death. Those who survive often have reduced mobility and may require greater social and nursing care.</P>
<P>
<B>Why might vitamin D help?</B>
</P>
<P>Vitamin D is necessary for building strong bone. Older people often have low vitamin D levels because of lack of exposure to sunlight and low consumption of vitamin D in their diet. Therefore, it has been suggested that taking additional vitamin D in the form of supplements may help to reduce the risk of fractures of the hip and other bones.</P>
<P>
<B>Purpose of this review</B>
</P>
<P>To investigate the effects of vitamin D or vitamin D-related supplements, taken with or without calcium supplements, for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women and older men.</P>
<P>
<B>Conduct of this review</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched the medical literature up to December 2012, and identified 53 relevant medical trials, with a total of 91,791 people taking part. The trials reported fracture outcomes in postmenopausal women or men aged over 65 years from community, hospital and nursing-home settings. These trials compared vitamin D or related supplements with &#8211; or without - calcium supplements, against fake supplements (placebo), no supplement or calcium supplements alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Findings of this review</B>
</P>
<P>The review found reliable evidence that taking vitamin D only, in the forms tested in the trials, is unlikely to prevent fractures. However, reliable evidence showed that vitamin D taken with additional calcium supplements slightly reduces the likelihood of hip fractures and other types of fracture. The review found that there was no increased risk of death from taking vitamin D and calcium.</P>
<P>Although the risk of harmful effects (such as gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms and kidney disease) from taking vitamin D and calcium is small, some people, particularly with kidney stones, kidney disease, high blood calcium levels, gastrointestinal disease or who are at risk of heart disease should seek medical advice before taking these supplements.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-11 16:56:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 53 trials with a total of 91,791 participants. Thirty-one trials, with sample sizes ranging from 70 to 36,282 participants, examined vitamin D (including 25-hydroxy vitamin D) with or without calcium in the prevention of fractures in community, nursing home or hospital inpatient populations. Twelve of these 31 trials had participants with a mean or median age of 80 years or over.</P>
<P>Another group of 22 smaller trials examined calcitriol or alfacalcidol (1-alphahydroxyvitamin D3), mostly with participants who had established osteoporosis. These trials were carried out in the setting of institutional referral clinics or hospitals.</P>
<P>In the assessment of risk of bias for random sequence generation, 21 trials (40%) were deemed to be at low risk, 28 trials (53%) at unclear risk and four trials at high risk (8%). For allocation concealment, 22 trials were at low risk (42%), 29 trials were at unclear risk (55%) and two trials were at high risk (4%).</P>
<P>There is high quality evidence that vitamin D alone, in the formats and doses tested, is unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture (11 trials, 27,693 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98 to 1.29) or any new fracture (15 trials, 28,271 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11).</P>
<P>There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium results in a small reduction in hip fracture risk (nine trials, 49,853 participants; RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; P value 0.01). In low-risk populations (residents in the community: with an estimated eight hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to one fewer hip fracture per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 0 to 2). In high risk populations (residents in institutions: with an estimated 54 hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to nine fewer hip fractures per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 2 to 14). </P>
<P>There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium is associated with a statistically significant reduction in incidence of new non-vertebral fractures. However, there is only moderate quality evidence of an absence of a statistically significant preventive effect on clinical vertebral fractures. There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium reduces the risk of any type of fracture (10 trials, 49,976 participants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99).</P>
<P>In terms of the results for adverse effects: mortality was not adversely affected by either vitamin D or vitamin D plus calcium supplementation (29 trials, 71,032 participants, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.01). Hypercalcaemia, which was usually mild (2.6 to 2.8 mmol/L), was more common in people receiving vitamin D or an analogue, with or without calcium (21 trials, 17,124 participants, RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.31), especially for calcitriol (four trials, 988 participants, RR 4.41, 95% CI 2.14 to 9.09), than in people receiving placebo or control. There was also a small increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms (15 trials, 47,761 participants, RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08), especially for calcium plus vitamin D (four trials, 40,524 participants, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09), and a significant increase in renal disease (11 trials, 46,548 participants, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33). Other systematic reviews have found an increased association of myocardial infarction with supplemental calcium; and evidence of increased myocardial infarction and stroke, but decreased cancer, with supplemental calcium plus vitamin D, without an overall effect on mortality.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-11 16:55:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fractures in the doses and formulations tested so far in older people. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium may prevent hip or any type of fracture. There was a small but significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms and renal disease associated with vitamin D and calcium. This review found that there was no increased risk of death from taking calcium and vitamin D.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-11 15:14:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoporosis, a gradual loss of bone mass, is a complex, chronic, multifactorial process, which is a normal part of ageing. It derives its public health importance from its association with the development of characteristic fractures late in life, and because of the increasing number of people living longer, particularly in industrialised societies. Both men and women are affected, but the main burden of disease is in post-menopausal women. Osteoporotic fractures include those of the hip, wrist and spinal vertebrae, and can lead to considerable disability. Incidence rates for hip fracture vary by a factor of more than ten worldwide, with age-standardised incidence rates highest in Scandinavia and lowest in Africa and South America (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2012</LINK>). Many patients with hip fractures have other medical conditions, but the hip fracture itself may account for 17% to 32% of deaths in patients with hip fracture, and 1.5% of all deaths in people aged 50 years or older (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2003</LINK>). Survivors of hip fracture are often disabled by reduced mobility and may require greater social and nursing care (<LINK REF="REF-Johnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A high proportion of vertebral fractures do not come to clinical attention and may not cause symptoms, but undiagnosed vertebral fractures may be associated with increased back pain and functional limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Nevitt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevitt 1998</LINK>). The criteria used to define vertebral fractures in radiographs may differ, but studies suggest that up to half of women over the age of 75 years in Europe and North America have vertebral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Between 1988 and 1998, in England and Wales, the estimated lifetime risk of hip fracture for a woman aged 50 years was 11.4%, and for a man aged 50 years was 3.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>). Similarly, the lifetime risk for a woman aged 50 years for a distal forearm fracture was 16.6% and for a clinically evident vertebral fracture, 3.1%; for a man aged 50 years these risks were 2.9% and 1.2% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>). In the last 20 years hip fracture rates have tended to stabilise - or even fall - in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, but rates may be rising in Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-11 14:59:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of the various interventions, such as vitamin D, that have been proposed for osteoporosis is the prevention of fractures. While slowing progressive bone loss plausibly reduces fracture rates, other factors, particularly the fall rate in older people, are clearly involved (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1995</LINK>). Effective strategies may require prophylactic measures many years before fractures are likely to occur. The conduct of randomised controlled trials of effectiveness in this context is difficult. Financial, academic and commercial pressures have favoured the selection of short-term intermediate outcomes, such as changes in bone mineral density (BMD), as evidence of efficacy, but the effectiveness of interventions is best measured using fracture outcomes.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-28 08:11:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin D is one of a number of agents with known biological effects on mineral homeostasis, acting mainly upon the intestine, kidneys and bone. Intestinal calcium absorption is stimulated and bone mass protected (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1993</LINK>), although the benefit may be largely lost within two years of discontinuation of the supplement (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson_x002d_Hughes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson-Hughes 2000</LINK>). Vitamin D is mostly derived from exposure of the skin to ultraviolet sunlight. Although there are a few dietary sources, such as oily fish, these contribute relatively little vitamin D (known as D3, cholecalciferol), except in people who consume oily fish several times a week. Synthetic vitamin D (known as D2, ergocalciferol) is frequently the form provided in supplements, but this may not be equivalent to vitamin D3 (<LINK REF="REF-Houghton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houghton 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration of vitamin D, and particularly its derivatives (analogues) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details of nomenclature, synonyms and abbreviations of vitamin D), may carry a risk of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria (high levels of calcium in the blood and urine, respectively). There is a winter decline in circulating vitamin D concentrations in older people living at high latitudes that may be correctable by a single injection of cholecalciferol (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1994</LINK>). However, the bioavailability of intramuscular vitamin D is variable, and may be very poor; thus intermittent high-dose oral supplementation may be more reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Romagnoli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romagnoli 2008</LINK>). The rates of hip fracture vary annually with a winter peak in both Northern and Southern hemispheres (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lau-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1995</LINK>). Inadequate vitamin D levels have been demonstrated in patients with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lips-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lips 2006</LINK>) - especially those with hip fracture - in many countries, although low levels may be influenced by the fracture itself (<LINK REF="REF-Pieper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pieper 2007</LINK>). Adequate calcium intake may also protect bone mass (<LINK REF="REF-Cumming-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 1990</LINK>), but calcium supplements may provoke gastrointestinal symptoms.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-28 08:12:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin D is an attractive candidate agent for use in public health interventions, particularly if it can be given intermittently in high dosage. A randomised trial widely quoted as supporting the effectiveness of vitamin D evaluated co-administration of daily oral vitamin D3 and calcium supplements (<LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK>). Calcium co-supplementation requires tablets to be taken daily, which may influence compliance; furthermore, calcium may be associated with gastrointestinal side-effects (<LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK>). A systematic review of current evidence to assess for effectiveness of vitamin D analogues, with and without calcium, in fracture prevention in older people should inform practice and research. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1996, and previously updated in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2009a</LINK>).</P>

In previous versions of the review, the category 'any new fracture' was classified as fractures not covered by hip, vertebral or non-vertebral categories, or where the site of fracture was unclear.

As a new feature in this version of the review for Analyses 1 to 4 (comparisons involving vitamin D), the category 'all fractures' includes data from non-vertebral fractures (or hip or vertebral fractures if not given), if the data for 'all fractures' are not available (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</LI>

<P>Sixty-three studies were excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table for details). Most were excluded because the trials did not present fracture data.</P>
<P>Attention is drawn to one particular excluded study, which has been quoted as evidence for effectiveness of single-dose vitamin D injection in fracture prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Heikinheimo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heikinheimo 1992</LINK>). This study was quasi-randomised (allocation based on month of birth) and there was no attempt at blinding. Only individuals recruited in the autumn and winter were included, and there was no placebo group. Follow-up varied between two and five years but the cumulative analysis of fracture incidence did not include confidence intervals despite the decreasing numbers with longer follow-up. Participants who rejected injection were added to the control group. Although considered ineligible for inclusion in this systematic review, this study was important mainly for raising the hypothesis that this relatively inexpensive, practical proposal for fracture prevention should be tested more rigorously.</P>
<P>We also draw attention to an excluded trial that we included in a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2005</LINK>), with a note that its result should be treated with caution. <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2004</LINK>, a cluster-randomised study (N = 4 clusters) was not included in our pooled analysis at that time, as the investigators' analysis appeared to be for individually randomised participants. We have now excluded this widely quoted study because it does not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Participants in each of the three treatment clusters received one or more co-interventions designed to reduce falls (medication review, environmental hazard and health assessment, and osteoporosis/fall prevention leaflets) but the control group received no intervention. No treatment group received vitamin D and calcium alone. Thus, although the investigators state that this was a factorial study, the reports of the design do not appear to fit that description, and the effect of vitamin D and calcium cannot be separated from the effects of co-interventions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin D alone versus placebo or no treatment</HEADING>
<P>Vitamin D alone, in the formats and doses tested, appears unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture (11 trials, 27,693 participants, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29). Vitamin D alone, in the formats and doses tested, also appears unlikely to reduce any new fracture (15 trials, 28,271 participants, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). The high quality of this evidence is reinforced by the visual impression of an absence of publication bias shown for both outcomes.</P>
<P>Vitamin D was administered in a variety of formats and doses (oral daily, oral intermittent, intra-muscular). However, none of the trials in this review tested daily vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> in doses greater than 800 IU. It has been suggested that higher doses of vitamin D are required, such as 1800 IU/day to 4000 IU/day (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2010</LINK>), in order to raise 25(OH)D to at least 75 to 110 nmol/L; although the US Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D concluded that a 25(OH)D of 50 nmol/L (equivalent to 20 ng/ml) should be adequate for 97.5% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2010</LINK>). Gallagher and colleagues evaluated doses of 400 IU to 4800 IU cholecalciferol taken daily for one year (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2012</LINK>), and concluded that 800 IU daily increased 25(OH)D to over 50 nmol/L in 97.5% of women (and 1600 IU/d to over 75 nmol/L in 97.5% of women), where baseline 25(OH)D was 37 nmol/L.</P>
<P>Intermittent annual high oral dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Vital-D" TYPE="STUDY">Vital D</LINK>) or intra-muscular injections (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2007</LINK>) were not effective. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Vital-D" TYPE="STUDY">Vital D</LINK>, one oral dose of 500,000 IU Vitamin D3 appeared to increase the risk of falls, particularly in the three months after dosing, which might have been related to the very high dose leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form of the vitamin) (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson_x002d_Hughes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson-Hughes 2010</LINK>), possibly accentuated by a lack of regular daily vitamin D replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Mak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mak 2010</LINK>). Neither of these trials appeared to recruit participants with very low baseline 25(OH)D levels (mean or medians of 45 nmol/L to 62 nmol/L) implying that participants may have had transient supratherapeutic levels. However, when these two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vital-D" TYPE="STUDY">Vital D</LINK>), and the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Law-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Law 2006</LINK> (for which the effects of clustering might not have been adequately controlled in our meta-analyses) are removed from the results, the conclusions of the meta-analyses are not changed.</P>
<P>A variety of new vitamin D oral dosing strategies are being tested for their effects on baseline 25(OH)D, namely: loading, daily, weekly, monthly and less frequent dosing strategies, and comparison of ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol (<LINK REF="REF-Bacon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Binkley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binkley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ish_x002d_Shalom-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ish-Shalom 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pekkarinen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pekkarinen 2010</LINK>). These newer regimens have not been tested in large trials of fracture prevention, where longer-term compliance might be improved by intermittent dosing.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin D plus calcium versus calcium alone</HEADING>
<P>Although there was no firm evidence that vitamin D (including 25-hydroxy vitamin D) with calcium was any more effective than calcium alone for preventing hip fracture, any non-vertebral fracture or vertebral fracture, there was some evidence that, for those participants not selected on the basis of a previous fracture, risk for any new fracture was reduced (nine trials, 6131 participants; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92) compared with those participants selected with a previous fracture (two trials, 2681 participants, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.20). Trials generally used a dose of cholecalciferol of 400 IU to 1000 IU given daily. The biological rationale for the subgroup differences is unclear, as is the practical application of this finding, since the decision to add vitamin D to existing calcium supplementation rarely arises. This finding also appears to contradict the results for vitamin D alone, and might suggest that vitamin D and calcium interact in the prevention of fractures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin D versus calcium</HEADING>
<P>Few trials examined the comparison of vitamin D versus calcium, and the results are dominated by those from the <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> trial. Although calcium appeared to be more effective than vitamin D in the prevention of vertebral fractures or deformity, this result should be interpreted with caution as reflected in the wide confidence intervals (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.53), where results are dominated by <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 2000</LINK> with only 258 participants. <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> only assessed vertebral fractures that came to clinical attention (seven events in 2654 participants).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vitamin D plus calcium versus placebo or no treatment</HEADING>
<P>There was high quality evidence that vitamin D and calcium resulted in a small reduction in hip fracture risk (nine trials, 49,853 participants; RR 0.(RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96) (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96) 84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). As an illustration, in low-risk populations (i.e. residents in the community: with an estimated eight hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to one fewer hip fracture per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 0 to 2). In high risk populations (i.e. residents in institutions: with an estimated 54 hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to nine fewer hip fractures per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 2 to 14). </P>
<P>There was high quality evidence that vitamin D and calcium was associated with a statistically significant reduction in incidence of new non-vertebral fractures. However, there was only moderate quality evidence of an absence of a statistically significant preventive effect on clinical vertebral fractures.</P>
<P>There was high quality evidence that vitamin D and calcium resulted in a small reduction in any new fracture risk (10 trials, 49,976 participants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). As an illustration, in low-risk populations (i.e. residents in the community: with an estimated 26 fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to one fewer fracture per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 0 to 3). In high risk populations (i.e. residents in institutions: with an estimated 75 fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to four fewer hip fractures per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 1 to 7). </P>
<P>Most trials used 400 IU to 800 IU vitamin D3 daily with co-administration of 1000 mg calcium. Not all trials provided vertebral fracture data, and no statistically significant effect on vertebral fracture was found (four trials, 42,185 participants, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09). The very large <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2006</LINK> trial used a lower dose of 400 IU vitamin D and 1000 mg calcium and showed a trend only for hip fracture reduction. However, 44% of women in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2006</LINK> were taking calcium and vitamin D at baseline and 3% were taking vitamin D. Analysis of women with and without the use of personal supplements of calcium and vitamin D at baseline did not suggest that this influenced the outcome for hip, or any fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2011b</LINK>). Using data from women who were not taking such supplements in our analyses, instead of the entire <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2006</LINK> trial population, does not affect the conclusions of the meta-analyses (data not shown). In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, removal of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2006</LINK> data for the entire trial population did not affect the conclusions of any of the fracture outcome analyses, including those of the subgroups, discussed below.<BR/>
<BR/>We conducted two subgroup analyses. The first separated the data by the residential status of the participants at recruitment. We defined institutional as residence in a nursing home or residential care home. We recognise that differences exist in nomenclature between different countries (for example nursing homes in Australia can mean high-level residential care homes or residential care homes in general) but found the descriptions provided by trialists sufficient to make a judgement in most cases. Studies with a mixed population were categorised as 'institutional' or 'community' based on the dominant place of residence of participants. For example, we classified <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> as a community study, as 94% of participants were resident in their own homes and only 6% were resident in institutions. This subgroup analysis was not pre-defined in the original review in 1995, but emerged for an earlier update from the accumulation of evidence, from clinical biochemistry and epidemiology, that many frail, institutionalised older people are vitamin D deficient, and likely to have lower 25(OH)vitamin D status. We hypothesised that they, in particular, might benefit from the administration of vitamin D and calcium. This analysis is particularly influenced by the two trials conducted amongst frail people living in nursing homes or apartments for older people in France (<LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 2002</LINK>). Tests for subgroup differences found no statistically significant differences between community or institutional residence populations for hip or any new fracture.</P>
<P>Considerable epidemiologic evidence supports the association between prior osteoporotic fracture and subsequent hip fracture; <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> therefore recruited participants with a prior fracture history. We found no evidence from our subgroup analyses (which was heavily dominated by <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK>), that a population with such a history, irrespective of age, benefits in respect of fracture incidence from receiving vitamin D and calcium. Although the dose of vitamin D3 used in <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> was the same as was used in <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 2002</LINK>, poorer compliance may have reduced the effect in <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK>. Compliance appears to have been very good in both <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK> (see reference in <LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2012</LINK>). Ways to improve compliance with bone-active medication of all forms in this population needs to be researched (<LINK REF="REF-Seeman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeman 2007</LINK>). Pooled data from studies where a previous osteoporotic fracture was not a selection criterion did show a statistically significant reduction in hip fracture or any type of fracture, but tests for subgroup differences between this group and those with a previous fracture did not show statistical significance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alfacalcidol</HEADING>
<P>Two trials of alfacalcidol suggested that vertebral fractures may be prevented by taking alfacalcidol (two trials, 872 participants, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65), although the evidence did not suggest prevention of hip or non-vertebral fractures. The data for vertebral fractures are mainly influenced by <LINK REF="STD-Hayashi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hayashi 1992</LINK>, which was quasi-randomised and thus susceptible to bias. Other small studies, which compared alfacalcidol and calcium with calcium alone, also suggested protection against vertebral fractures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Calcitriol</HEADING>
<P>The effect of calcitriol in fracture prevention is unclear, with the best evidence for effectiveness coming from the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Tilyard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tilyard 1992</LINK> that compared calcitriol with calcium and where vertebral deformities were significantly reduced only in the second and third years (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-011.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.3</LINK>). However, the use of calcitriol is associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of hypercalcaemia (four trials, 988 participants, RR 4.41, 95% CI 2.14 to 9.09).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Not all trials reported adverse effects. Overall, there was no significant effect of vitamin D on mortality, or from groups of supplement types such as vitamin D and calcium (see also <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), in the trials examined here, which only encompassed fracture prevention (29 trials, 71,032 participants, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.01, <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>). In the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2009a</LINK>), vitamin D and calcium were associated with a reduction in mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99). This partly relates to reclassification of some of the trials in the subgroups in this analysis due to the use of the factorial design, as well as the inclusion of one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSTPRE_x002d_FPS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">OSTPRE-FPS 2007</LINK>). A Cochrane review examined all forms of vitamin D supplementation including with calcium (as in our overall meta-analysis of mortality) in 56 trials and found a similar RR to our study with narrower and statistically significant confidence intervals: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99 (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Calcium supplements could increase the risk of myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2010</LINK>), particularly in people with a higher dietary calcium intake, suggesting over-therapeutic usage of supplements. Supplements of calcium and vitamin D could also increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2011a</LINK>), but might also decrease the risk of total and breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2011b</LINK>). However, this review found no significant increase in mortality in trials of vitamin D and calcium.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal effects and renal disease were particularly likely to be not reported. In the past, there has been serious concern that cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol may be associated with hypercalcaemia when given in only moderate doses, which may have led to cautious use of low doses in the trials of vitamin D. There is some evidence that potential toxicity in this respect has been seriously overestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2012</LINK>), and that requirements for vitamin D3 might be more than previously recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Vieth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieth 2001</LINK>). However, hypercalcaemia was found more often in participants taking vitamin D, but this mainly related to the use of calcitriol. Gastrointestinal effects and renal disease (especially calculi) were more common amongst participants receiving vitamin D, and in these cases calcium and vitamin D appeared to be most associated with increased risk (see also <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). These analyses were dominated by <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2006</LINK> in which calcium supplements were also given (with the associated use of off-study calcium and vitamin D), but there was no significant difference between the subgroups with and without calcium supplementation in our meta-analysis. Our results for hypercalcaemia, gastrointestinal effects and renal disease were similar to those from the Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2014</LINK>, although the latter review also included trials of vitamin D whose aim was not fracture prevention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-11 14:19:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a large evidence base from 31 trials that examined vitamin D (including 25-hydroxy vitamin D) with or without calcium in the prevention of fractures, mostly set in the community, nursing home or hospital inpatient population, and generally with older participants than in the second group of trials described below. Twelve trials had participants with a mean or median age of 80 years or over. Only three trials recruited participants because they had all had a previous fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Avenell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Avenell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harwood-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harwood 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The second group of 22 smaller trials of calcitriol or alfacalcidol - almost all of which recruited from referral populations with established osteoporosis - were carried out in the setting of institutional referral clinics or hospitals. In the majority of cases, osteoporosis had been formally diagnosed, and often the presence of one or more deformed vertebrae on an initial radiograph was required for inclusion in the trial. None of this group of trials had participants with a mean or median age of 80 years or more.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether the effectiveness of vitamin D and calcium found in the nursing home trials in France by <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 2002</LINK> is transferable to other institutional populations in other countries. Further trials in similar settings in other countries would be valuable, although the adoption of use of vitamin D and calcium in these settings, based on these two studies, might raise ethical issues and make further placebo-controlled trials difficult to carry out. There is also suggestion that the focus be shifted from high-dose supplementary calcium to dietary calcium in the calcium/vitamin D supplementation regime, given the evidence provided by <LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2011a</LINK> of increased cardiovascular disease with oral calcium supplementation, with or without co-supplementation with vitamin D, especially in those who are calcium-replete in their diet.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> gives the baseline 25(OH)D levels in the intervention and control groups of the included studies. The values have to be interpreted with caution, since they depend on the laboratory and method used (<LINK REF="REF-Lips-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lips 1999</LINK>). It might be expected that those people with the lowest 25(OH)D levels would benefit most from supplementation, and there is some suggestion of this in <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 1992</LINK> (25(OH)D of 40 nmol/L) and <LINK REF="STD-Chapuy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapuy 2002</LINK> (22 nmol/L). <LINK REF="STD-Lips-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lips 1996</LINK> (27 nmol/L) also had low values, but had a lower dose of supplementation of 400 IU vitamin D3 daily. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-RECORD-2005" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD 2005</LINK> trial are somewhat contradictory, given the 25(OH)D3 level of 38 nmol/L. <LINK REF="STD-OSTPRE_x002d_FPS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">OSTPRE-FPS 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vital-D" TYPE="STUDY">Vital D</LINK> had 25(OH)D levels in intervention groups of 50 nmol/L and 53 nmol/L, respectively. The statistically significant treatment effect for all fractures from the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Dawson_x002d_Hughes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson-Hughes 1997</LINK> is also unusual given the high average baseline value of 77 nmol/L.</P>
<P>Despite the ability of injection of vitamin D to reduce the winter decline in serum vitamin D concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1994</LINK>), and the apparently positive findings of <LINK REF="STD-Trivedi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Trivedi 2003</LINK>, there is robust evidence that the administration of vitamin D alone, whether by annual injection, periodic bolus oral dosage, or daily oral dosage, is unlikely to be effective for fracture prevention in the doses used here.

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-28 09:37:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a large body of evidence from 53 trials with 91,791 participants. Our assessments of risk of bias and quality assessment are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. There were only four trials with high risk of bias for random sequence generation and two trials with high risk for allocation concealment, and these had no influence on the findings for vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium trials. The evidence base from trials examining vitamin D alone versus placebo or no treatment, and vitamin D and calcium together versus placebo or no treatment was of high (&#8220;Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect&#8221;) or moderate quality (&#8220;Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.&#8221;).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-28 08:27:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that selection bias is unlikely in this review. We have searched a wide range of databases and handsearched numerous relevant journals. We note, though, that we have identified 12 reports of studies that may, if further information becomes available, be eligible for inclusion. The contact author for the review is in touch with research groups in this field. Action was taken to minimise bias in the selection of studies for inclusion, and during the process of quality assessment and data extraction, as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Authors who had participated in included trials (AA and WJG, a previous author) were not involved in the quality assessment or data extraction relating to those studies.</P>
<P>However the reporting of adverse effects (Analyses 14.1 to 14.4) includes only RCTs in which vitamin D or vitamin D analogues had fracture data. Our search strategy was not designed to identify studies in which vitamin D was administered in studies with no fracture data. Nor would it have identified other study types that might have provided useful data on adverse effects. So, the data used in these analyses are incomplete, although there is no reason to suspect that they are not representative.</P>
<P>Ascertainment bias cannot be completely ruled out. Incomplete information was available to us on the number of drop outs from intervention and control groups in a number of trials. Thus, it is possible that our analyses, based on the principles of intention-to-treat, might have under-estimated the number of outcome events in the intervention or control groups, or both.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-11 16:55:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been a large number of recent trial level and individual patient data meta-analyses of vitamin D, with or without calcium, for the prevention of fracture. The meta-analyses (like those here) are limited by the small number of trials and limited combinations of treatments and doses, although this Cochrane review includes more trials than any of the previous systematic reviews. Most reported that calcium was required in addition to vitamin D for effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DIPART-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">DIPART 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murad 2012</LINK>). However, Bischoff-Ferrari and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2012</LINK>), in an attempt to correct for compliance and off-study use of supplements, reported that calcium did not improve the anti-fracture efficacy of vitamin D. <LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2012</LINK> has been criticised for the methods used, including compromising the benefits of randomisation in the trials analysed (<LINK REF="REF-Abrahamsen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrahamsen 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2007</LINK> and colleagues undertook a systematic review of calcium, with and without vitamin D, in the prevention of fractures. The addition of vitamin D to calcium did not significantly change the effect of calcium alone. However, no meta-analysis of trials with treatment arms of vitamin D and calcium compared with calcium was undertaken, as in our comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>), and we have included several newer trials.</P>
<P>Fractures may result from falls, so we would draw readers' attention to two recent Cochrane reviews on prevention of falls in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2012</LINK>), and in institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2012</LINK>), which include many of the trials here. In the community, vitamin D with or without calcium may reduce the rate or risk of falls in people if they have lower 25(OH)D status (25 nmol/L to 55 nmol/L in the trials). In residents in institutions, vitamin D alone appeared to reduce the rate of falls, with two of the trials comparing vitamin D and calcium to calcium alone. Other systematic reviews have examined the effect of vitamin D in preventing falls (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalyani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalyani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2008</LINK>), with some finding calcium was required too (<LINK REF="REF-Kalyani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalyani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murad 2011</LINK>), but this was not always clear (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff_x002d_Ferrari-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff-Ferrari 2009a</LINK>). A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2008</LINK> and colleagues reported that alfacalcidol or calcitriol could reduce the risk of experiencing one or more falls.</P>
<P>In an individual patient data and trial-level meta-analysis of vitamin D with or without calcium, while vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a reduction in mortality, vitamin D alone was not (<LINK REF="REF-Rejnmark-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rejnmark 2012</LINK>). An earlier systematic review of randomised trials found that vitamin D was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, which did not appear to relate to additional calcium provision (<LINK REF="REF-Autier-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Autier 2007</LINK>). In the Cochrane review of vitamin D supplementation and mortality, cholecalciferol and calcium were associated with a reduction in mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99), but cholecalciferol alone was not (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Vitamin D plus calcium can help prevent hip fracture or any type of fracture. The benefits need to be balanced against the risk of kidney stones, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease or heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bolland-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolland 2011a</LINK>). Vitamin D and calcium together are not associated with an increased risk of dying.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Vitamin D alone, in the doses and formulations that have been used, appears unlikely to be effective in fracture prevention in older people.</P>
<P>Alphacalcidol may protect against vertebral fractures.</P>
<P>Calcitriol appears to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects such as hypercalcaemia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-11 15:19:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Newer vitamin D dosing strategies to achieve better long-term compliance and at least a 25(OH)D level of 75 nmol/L, should be tested in institutional settings for fracture prevention. As the generalisability of the trials from French nursing homes is still unclear, and calcium and vitamin D have more adverse effects and require daily dosing, a third calcium and vitamin D arm could be added to a trial of vitamin D compared to placebo or control intervention.</P>
<P>The design and reporting of any future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>), or any future development of it. Trials using cluster randomisation should perform appropriate analyses and include sufficient information in trial reports to aid interpretation by readers and users of such trials (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>In previous versions of the review, the category 'any new fracture' was classified as fractures not covered by hip, vertebral or non-vertebral categories, or where the site of fracture was unclear. This meant that some of the very large community trials were not analysed together (Analyses 1 to 4; all vitamin D comparisons), because they chose to report 'non-vertebral fractures' or 'hip fractures' or 'vertebral fractures' but not 'all fractures' and these numbers were not available or could not be calculated from the data without risk of double counting. In this review for Analyses 1 to 4 the category 'all fractures' includes data from non-vertebral fractures (or hip or vertebral fractures if not given), if the data for 'all fractures' are not available.</P>

<P>This study has been widely quoted as providing evidence for the effectiveness of single dose vitamin D in fracture prevention. It is an open quasi-randomised trial. As only individuals recruited in the northern hemisphere's autumn and winter were included for practical reasons, allocation was not concealed, being based on month of birth. There was no placebo and enrolment was biased. Follow-up varied from 2 to 5 years but the cumulative analysis of fracture incidence did not include confidence intervals despite the decreasing numbers with longer follow-up. This study was, therefore, excluded from the analysis, but is important for raising the hypothesis that this relatively inexpensive, practical method of fracture prevention should be tested more rigorously</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>I note that the odds ratio is given as 0.68 at three years follow up for the outcome "Persons with new hip fracture in 3 years" for Chapuy 1992. However this differs slightly from the odds ratio presented in the original BMJ publication. Why do these two results differ and why don't the reviewers present odds ratio based on intention-to-treat analysis as presented in the analysis in this paper?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for pointing out this discrepancy. This occurred because, by mistake, we used the data for the total number of hip fractures sustained rather than those for the number of people sustaining one or more hip fractures. The corrected intention-to-treat analysis, presented in the review, yields the same odds ratio as in the BMJ article.</P>

<P>Your 'Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women and older men' is an excellent example of superb and rigorous activity applied in a way that is completely useless; that is when the process fails to consider whether the original studies are based on flawed assumptions. For example, were you to review the criteria in the studies evaluated, the preponderance of them will show the investigators' lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of cholecalciferol, which they think of it as a "vitamin", and they fail to appreciate that a blood level approximating 50 ng/ml is normal. Instead, they set the bar and the dosage so low as to be very close to proving a negative effect. Any protocol for the effects of cholecalciferol that does not include as a fundamental criterion, dosing in such a manner as DAILY (instead of Stoss-like frequencies of weekly, monthly, or worst, single-megadose) in the amounts the human body will generate when given modest UV-B exposure that more closely mimics the evolutionary stimulii for humans, AND then verifying by frequent testing of the 25(OH)D levels to insure a level of around 50 ng/ml is not only achieved but maintained throughout the study, is useless.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 09:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank you for your comments on our Cochrane Review. Cochrane Reviews can only cover the actual trials that have been conducted, and so are limited by the vitamin D formulations, doses and dosing schedules used by those trials.</P>
<P>In the text of our review we do point out that "the administration of vitamin D alone, whether by annual injection, periodic bolus oral dosage, or daily oral dosage, is unlikely to be effective for fracture prevention <I>in the doses used here"</I>.</P>
<P>We also state that "Vitamin D was administered in a variety of formats and doses (oral daily, oral intermittent, intra-muscular). However, none of the trials in this review tested daily vitamin D3 in doses greater than 800 IU. It has been suggested that higher doses of vitamin D are required, such as 1800 IU/day to 4000 IU/day (Bischoff-Ferrari 2010), in order to raise 25(OH)D to at least 75 to 110 nmol/ L."</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review will be updated when the results of trials with daily higher dose oral vitamin D are available, producing around the 25(OH)D levels you suggest. An example is the US VITAL trial, which aims to provide levels of 90 nmol/L.</P>
