<P>Iodine deficiency causes mental retardation in children as well as an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) and sometimes deficiencies in thyroid hormones in people of all ages. It still exists in large parts of the world. This review looked at studies with a comparison group of iodine supplementation in children. Twenty-six studies were included, but these were generally of poor quality. Iodine was given as iodised oil, salt or water. Giving iodine generally decreased thyroid size and increased iodine in the urine. One study suggested a reduction in infant mortality. In some studies there was a trend towards better developmental outcomes after iodine prophylaxis. There was some concern in studies using iodised salt that small children may not eat enough salt to achieve adequate iodine status. Adverse effects were reported, and most of them were minor and did not last long. More high quality long term studies measuring outcomes related to child development, to deaths associated with iodine-deficiency, and to intervention programmes relevant to children in developed countries, are needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-10-04 11:09:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Iodine deficiency is the main cause of potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood, as well as causing goitre and hypothyroidism in people of all ages. It is still prevalent in large parts of the world. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of iodine supplementation overall, and of different forms and dosages of iodine supplementation separately, in the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-04 11:00:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists, databases of ongoing trials and the Internet were searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials and prospective controlled trials not using randomisation of iodine supplementation in children living in areas of iodine deficiency. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers did the initial data selection and quality assessment of trials independently. As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar and not of sufficient quality, we did not do a meta-analysis but summarised the data in a narrative format.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-04 11:09:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-six prospective controlled trials were related to our question, assessing a total of 29613 children. Twenty of them were classified as being of low quality, six of moderate quality. Most studies used iodised oil as a supplement, but other supplements were also used. The intervention groups were compared to a non-supplemented control group, different doses or different forms of iodine supplementation.</P>
<P>There was a clear tendency towards goitre reduction with iodine supplementation; this was significant in several studies. Significant differences in physical development were not seen, except in one study. Results for differences in cognitive and psychomotor measures were mixed, with only few studies showing a positive intervention effect. One study suggested that infant mortality was lowered after iodine supplementation.</P>
<P>Most studies showed a significant increase in urinary iodine excretion and levels recommended by the WHO were reached in most cases after supplementation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly reduced in one study. In 1.8% of the children investigated, adverse effects were found, most of them were minor and transient.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that iodine supplementation, especially iodised oil, is an effective means of decreasing goitre rates and improving iodine status in children. Indications of positive effects on physical and mental development and mortality were seen, although results were not always significant. Adverse effects were generally minor and transient. Insufficient evidence was available on non-oil supplements. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address the question of the best form of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.</P>

<P>
<B>IODINE</B>
</P>
<P>Iodine is a trace element which is an integral part of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), produced by the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped organ situated in the neck. Thyroid hormones are essential for regulating and stimulating metabolism, temperature control, and normal growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1981</LINK>). Synthesis and release of thyroid hormones are stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is released from the pituitary gland; this regulation is subject to feedback inhibition.</P>
<P>
<B>THE PROBLEM OF IODINE DEFICIENCY</B>
</P>
<P>Iodine deficiency (urinary iodine excretion less than 100 µg/day) is the main cause for potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). It causes hypothyroidism, resulting in thyroid enlargement, mental retardation, increased neonatal and infant mortality, retardation of growth and development of the central nervous system in children (cretinism), reproductive failure, and an increase of fluid in the tissues (myxoedema) (<LINK REF="REF-Delong-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delong 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaufrere-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaufrere 2000</LINK>). There are three main laboratory indicators of iodine deficiency: 1. increased TSH concentration in neonatal blood and cord blood, 2. increased concentration of thyroglobulin (protein in the thyroid gland from which thyroid hormones are synthesised), and 3. decreased concentration of iodine in the urine. Development of goitre, i.e. an enlargement of the thyroid gland (due to stimulation of growth by TSH), is common (endemic goitre) and may occur even in the absence of hormonal abnormalities (euthyroid goitre).</P>
<P>Iodine deficiency is common, especially in Asia and Africa, but also in large parts of Eastern Europe. Only a small number of countries currently have sustainable iodine sufficiency, and about a third of the world's population lives in areas with some iodine deficiency. Inland areas, especially mountainous areas like the Alps, Himalayas and the Andes are particularly iodine deficient (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1998a</LINK>). Iodine deficiency disorders are a global health problem with nearly two billion people at risk (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO_x002f_IAEA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO/IAEA 1996</LINK>). In countries such as China, the incidence of iodine deficiency diseases in children and pregnant women in areas of iodine deficiency may be up to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Fong-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1997</LINK>). In certain Asian, African and Latin American countries iodine deficiency diseases affect more than 200 million people (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>HISTORY OF PREVENTION OF IODINE DEFICIENCY DISORDERS</B>
</P>
<P>Large programmes for the prevention of iodine deficiency - or more specifically endemic goitre - using iodised salt were already initiated in Switzerland and in the USA in the 1920s, where large surveys of goitre incidence before and after the intervention showed the use of iodised salt to be an effective preventative intervention. New Zealand followed in 1941 but only very low iodisation levels were used in the first 20 years. Then in the 1950s and the 1960s a number of European countries followed, with associated reductions in endemic goitre rates. Before 1960, interventions for iodine deficiency disorders were pursued by every country independently. Between 1961 and 1973, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had four international meetings regarding interventions for iodine deficiency. At the fourth meeting in 1973, diagnostic criteria, measures of intervention, and directions of research were suggested. At the fifth meeting in 1983, these diagnostic criteria were revised. In 1986, the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) was established in Katmandu, Nepal. Based on the proposal of the ICCIDD, the 39th World Health Congress in 1986, declared that iodine deficiency disorders should be controlled within the following ten years. Since its establishment in 1986, the ICCIDD's work focused on Africa and South-East Asia. The 43rd World Health Congress in 1990 declared that iodine deficiency disorders should have disappeared from the earth by 2000. Also in 1990, the 71 heads of States and 80 other officials from 150 governments who attended the World Summit for Children held in New York adopted the goal of virtual elimination of iodine deficiency disorders by the year 2000. In response to this recommendation, most of the countries with iodine deficiency problems agreed to try to iodise 90% of all edible salt by 1995. However, by 2001, iodine deficiency disorders had not been eliminated and 36 affected countries had not introduced salt iodisation programmes (see <LINK REF="REF-Delange-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delange 2001</LINK>). The UN have now extended the deadline for (virtual) elimination of iodine deficiency worldwide to 2005 (see www.unicef.org).</P>
<P>
<B>IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION</B>
</P>
<P>Iodised salt, iodised bread, iodised water, iodine tablets and iodised oil (given orally or by injection) are commonly used for preventing iodine deficiency disorders. Iodised salt is considered the most appropriate means of iodine supplementation. The current recommended level of salt iodisation is 20-40 mg iodine per kg of salt. Salt is usually iodised using potassium iodate or potassium iodide, where the former is the more stable and less soluble form. Salt is the vehicle of choice for the following reasons: 1. It is consumed by nearly everyone at roughly equal amounts throughout the year, 2. Salt production is limited to a few centres, facilitating quality control, 3. Addition of iodate or iodide does not affect the taste or smell of the salt, and 4. Iodisation is cheap (less than 0.01 US Dollar a day for the estimated amount of salt intake). However, there have been problems with implementing salt iodisation in countries with numerous scattered salt deposits and complex distribution systems, so alternatives are sometimes required (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1998a</LINK>), especially in the short term, before high quality salt iodisation programmes can be implemented. In these cases, single applications of iodised oils are often used. Another possible disadvantage of iodised salt is that children, who are the group most vulnerable to iodine deficiency, may not have a high enough salt consumption for salt to be an appropriate vehicle for correcting iodine deficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996a</LINK>). Also, salt consumption in adults has been linked to hypertension, and as hypertension and cardiovascular disease are growing healthcare problems, a reduction of salt intake is recommended, which may at the same time reduce iodine intake to inadequate levels (<LINK REF="REF-Cann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cann 2002</LINK>). Other longer term solutions include iodisation of water supplies.<BR/>
<BR/>The WHO recommends a daily intake of 90 µg of iodine for infants (0-59 months), 120 µg for schoolchildren (6-12 years), 150 µg for adolescents and adults and 200 µg for pregnant and lactating women. The appropriate level of iodine supplementation in dietary supplements will depend on the individual consumption of the iodised food (salt, water, bread etc.), the degree of iodine deficiency in the area and the loss of iodine from producer to consumer. All these factors will be different in different countries, and for example, levels of salt iodisation have varied substantially between countries and over time. Iodine supplements in the form of tablets or injections can be dosed more accurately than food supplements, but some of these interventions require personal contact with the population to be treated (i.e. a large administrative effort) and methods providing intermittent doses of iodine provide uneven levels of iodine during the months between administration (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The response to supplemental iodine may be reduced by other factors in the environment, such as consumption of specific goitrogenic foods (for example, cassava (manioc)), and deficiency of other trace elements in the diet, such as selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_hrle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köhrle 1999</LINK>) or iron (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>DIAGNOSIS OF IODINE DEFICIENCY DISORDERS</B>
</P>
<P>The following recommendations regarding assessment of iodine deficiency disorders are given by the WHO (in collaboration with the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the ICCIDD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>):</P>
<P>Even though intra-individual variation exists, this tends to even out among populations. Twenty-four hour urine samples and relating urinary iodine to creatinine are not recommended.</P>
<P>One variable often measured is thyroid size. However, the determination of thyroid size is not feasible in neonates and it may be of limited use in school children (8 to 12 years), a group often studied, as the highest prevalence of goitre occurs during puberty and childbearing age. The two most common methods of measuring thyroid size are by palpation or by ultrasonography. While many studies assess goitre by palpation, the WHO suggests that this is not a very useful technique for determining the impact of iodisation programmes, where thyroid volumes may decrease over time, making them more difficult to assess. The technique and classification of measurement of goitre by palpation are specified by the WHO. Ultrasonography is the method of choice for assessing the impact of iodisation programmes on thyroid size, an application of the technique is becoming feasible even in remote areas of the world (the 'thyromobil project'). It should be noted however, that in adults with longstanding goitres, correction of iodine deficiency may have less of an impact on thyroid size than in children (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Measurement of TSH levels, which are expected to be elevated in iodine deficiency, is not a reliable indicator in school children and adults as differences to normal levels are small and there is a large overlap between values in people who are iodine sufficient and those who are iodine deficient. However, TSH levels are a good indicator of iodine deficiency in neonates. Increased thyroglobulin levels are a good indicator of thyroid hyperplasia resulting from iodine deficiency. Thyroglobulin levels reflect iodine nutrition over months and years, whereas urinary iodine levels measure the more immediate effects of increased iodine intake on iodine status. Measurement of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) is not recommended, as the tests are difficult and expensive and the measurements are not very reliable indicators of iodine deficiency.</P>
<P>
<B>EVIDENCE FROM CONTROLLED STUDIES</B>
</P>
<P>Many large surveys on goitre prevalence have been carried out worldwide, but not many randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of iodine supplementation for goitre prevention have been done. A previous version of the present review investigated salt iodisation only and identified six prospective controlled studies, of which only four were clearly randomised and most were of poor quality (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2002</LINK>). The results of that review suggested that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status, although the effect on goitre rates was less clear. No conclusions could be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. Another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2001</LINK>) investigated the effect of maternal iodine supplementation in pregnant women. The review suggested that iodine supplementation leads to improved outcomes in the children of the mothers having received the supplements (decreased mortality, decreased prevalence of cretinism and increased scores of psychomotor development). However, as the review only included pregnant women and outcomes in their children, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the effects of iodine supplementation in the general population. One randomised controlled trial lasting one year suggests that improved iodine status in school children (7 to 11 years) can improve mental performance (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Briel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van den Briel 2000</LINK>). This followed an earlier meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bleichrodt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleichrodt 1994</LINK>) of both observational and experimental studies including a control group of the effect of iodine deficiency on mental development. The meta-analysis included 2676 participants (mainly children) and the intelligence quotient (IQ) was used as the main outcome measure. The IQs of non-iodine-deficient groups were on average 13.5 IQ points higher than those of iodine-deficient groups. A non-systematic review of iodine supplementation with iodised oil (<LINK REF="REF-Sankar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 1995</LINK>) quotes a number of randomised controlled trials that report improved iodine status and reduced goitre rates with iodised oil supplementation. The author suggests that iodised oil supplementation may be an effective means for immediate relief of iodine deficiency, before salt iodisation programmes can be put in place.</P>
<P>
<B>ADVERSE EFFECTS OF IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION</B>
</P>
<P>However, there have been concerns that correcting for iodine deficiency with excessive supplementation of iodine increases the risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Delange-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delange 1999</LINK>) and thyroid auto-immunity (<LINK REF="STD-Kahaly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahaly 1997</LINK>). The possibility of allergic reactions to iodine have also been mentioned. The data suggest that iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, with possible associated cardiac consequences that can be fatal, mainly occurs in people over forty years of age with nodular goitres, in whom some thyroid autonomy has developed, i.e. thyroid hormone production is not inhibited by increased levels of iodine (<LINK REF="REF-Corvilain-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvilain 1998</LINK>). The risk of developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism seems to be higher when initial iodine deficiency are severe and when the initial rise in iodine intake is great. Increases in cases of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism are often only temporary after the introduction of iodisation programmes, but there are also cases in which the disorder persists. As symptoms of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism are often not very severe and very non-specific, it is easy to overlook the problem unless investigators specifically study hormone levels (<LINK REF="REF-Stanbury-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanbury 1998</LINK>). While surveys suggest that the benefits of iodine supplementation outweigh the risks, the potentially fatal nature of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism places an increased importance on adequate monitoring of the levels of iodine in supplements, on adequate monitoring of the iodine status of populations and on early detection of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>AIM</B>
</P>
<P>In light of this incomplete evidence and the possibility of adverse effects, a systematic review of controlled trials of different types of iodine supplementation in comparison to each other and to a non-iodine control is needed. This review will concentrate on interventions in children only, as children are at an increased risk of experiencing adverse effects in response to iodine deficiency. Additionally, a number of studies (see <LINK REF="STD-Pretell-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pretell 1969</LINK>) have shown that consequences of iodine deficiency, such as increased goitre rates, are particularly prevalent in primary school children and decrease during adolescence. Long-term iodine deficiency in adults sometimes give rise to nodular goitres which generally do not respond to iodine supplementation such as provided in prevention programmes (see also www.iccidd.org).</P>

<P>To assess the effects of iodine supplementation (using, for example, iodised salt, iodised oil, iodised water, iodised bread, iodine tablets) in comparison with placebo or with each other on outcomes relating to of iodine deficiency disorders in children.</P>

<P>Only randomised or quasi-randomised trials and prospective non-randomised experimental studies with a concurrent control group were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>As one of the important outcome measures is goitre incidence and this is often measured by palpation, requiring some personal judgement, blinding of outcome assessors would seem particularly important. Most of the important outcome measures like goitre or mental development in children will require a trial duration of at least one year, but we will also consider shorter trials to look at some additional outcome measures, such as iodine status.</P>
<P>Trials using indicators for assessment of iodine deficiency disorders that are approved by WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD will be preferred (see above).</P>
<P>
<I>Changes from protocol:</I> Originally, we had planned also to consider other types of controlled studies (e.g. observational cohort studies with a control group), as based on our experience with a previous review on iodised salt only we had expected to find few prospective controlled trials.

The objective of the study was related to prevention of iodine deficiency, 3. The study examined outcomes in children, and 4. The study had a prospective design and a control group.

<P>The quality of reporting of each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers (LA, CC) according to a modification of the quality criteria specified by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), as shown below. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>In particular, the following quality criteria were assessed:</P>
<P>1. Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>2. Minimisation of performance bias - were the participants and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>3. Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>4. Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>As some forms of iodine supplementation, for example salt iodisation under certain circumstances, can be unreliable and as in some countries a number of foodstuffs available commercially also contain iodised salt, we also considered whether<BR/>1. The iodine content of the supplement was verified<BR/>2. Any iodine contamination in other food and drink consumed was investigated or at least estimated<BR/>3. The comparison groups were similar at baseline with respect to iodine consumption and presence of signs of iodine deficiency</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into one of the following three categories:<BR/>A (high quality) - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B (moderate quality) - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C (low quality) - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>

<P>We had planned to include data in a meta-analysis if they were of sufficient quality and sufficiently similar. However, as studies identified were very heterogeneous, we decided to provide a descriptive summary only.</P>
<P>If enough suitable trials for meta-analysis will become available in future, we will use the following approach:</P>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials will be included in a meta-analysis. We expect both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. Dichotomous data will be expressed as relative risks. They may be converted to absolute measures like the number needed to treat if doses and follow-up times are similar. Continuous data will be expressed as weighted mean differences. Overall results will be calculated based on the random effects model, if possible, based on data from an intention-to-treat analysis. If the study does not report results on an intention-to-treat basis but sufficient data are given to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, this will be reconstructed. Heterogeneity will be tested for using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance being set at p &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity will be assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Small study bias will be tested for using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review.</P>

<P>Goitre was generally measured by palpation (most studies) or ultrasonography. Different classification methods were used. Data on goitre prevalence were given in different ways (goitre rate (percent), number above 97th percentile, number of participants with increased in goitre, number with different scores on goitre scales, thyroid size (ml), visible goitre rate, etc.). Iodine excretion was measured using different methods and in a number of different units, which could not always be converted to a unit allowing comparison between studies, due to missing data.</P>

Goitre rate was changed by -85% to +13% in the supplemented group and by -18% to +18% in the control group. In three studies goitre rate decreased, in two it increased. Control groups had always either smaller decreases or larger increases in goitre rates. The treatment effect was significant in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-McCullagh-1963" TYPE="STUDY">McCullagh 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Wahab-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Wahab 1984</LINK>), in the others statistical analyses were not mentioned.</P>
<P>URINARY IODINE EXCRETION.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Modes of application - oral oil versus intramuscular injection</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared oral iodised poppyseed oil (Lipiodol) with intramuscularly injected poppyseed oil (<LINK REF="STD-Eltom-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Eltom 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1996</LINK>). In two of them, the poppyseed oil used in both groups contained the same amount of iodine (480 mg); in the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Eltom-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Eltom 1985</LINK>), oral poppyseed oil contained 400 mg iodine and the intramuscular injection contained 475 mg of iodine.</P>
<P>GOITRE/THYROID SIZE. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1996</LINK>), goitre rate/thyroid volume did not change in the orally supplemented group; in the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Eltom-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Eltom 1985</LINK>), reduction of goitre in the orally supplemented group was 48% after one year and 32% after 2 years; in the intramuscularly supplemented groups of the three studies, goitre/thyroid volume changed was between +13.5% and -47%. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>) reported that reduction of goitre was significantly greater in the intramuscular group. The other two studies did not report statistical significance. <BR/>
<BR/>URINARY IODINE EXCRETION. Two studies compared urinary iodine excretion after oral iodised poppyseed oil with iodised poppy seed oil given intramuscularly in similar doses (<LINK REF="STD-Eltom-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Eltom 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>). Urinary iodine excretion increased in the orally supplemented group after one year by 129% to 244% and by 444 to 1060% in the intramuscularly supplemented group. Values were always significantly higher than at baseline, but differences between treatments were not statistically analysed.<BR/>
<BR/>TSH. Two studies compared oral iodised poppyseed oil with intramuscular iodised poppyseed oil with respect to TSH levels; in the oral groups, TSH was decreased by 9% to 46%, in the intramuscular groups by 16% to 45%. Decreases were significant in both groups in <LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>, and in the intramuscular group in <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>THYROGLOBULIN. One study compared oral iodised poppyseed oil with intramuscular iodised poppyseed oil with respect to thyroglobulin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>); in both groups thyroglobulin was decreased by 90%.</P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS. Adverse events were assessed in all three studies. The following adverse events were evaluated: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroglobulin and microsomal auto-antibodies, and transient submandibular swelling. Two cases with positive titres of microsomal antibodies were found in the oral groups, 85 cases with transient submandibular swelling in the oral groups and one case with subclinical hypothyroidism in the intramuscular groups.

Two studies assessed potassium iodate versus potassium iodide supplementation, one in salt and one in tablet form (<LINK REF="STD-Scrimshaw-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Scrimshaw 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>). In both trials, equivalent amounts of iodine were used in the comparison groups. In the iodate groups, goitre rates were reduced by 62.0% to 69.2%, in the iodide groups they were reduced by 49.2% to 61.8%, with no significant differences between comparison groups. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Scrimshaw-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Scrimshaw 1953</LINK>, goitre rates decreased by 43.9% to 69.2% in the iodate group and by 40.3% to 61.8% in the iodide group (assessed at 15, 20 and 25 weeks). <LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK> measured goitre rates after five years of iodised salt intake and found reductions in goitre rate of 62.0% in the iodate group compared with 49.2% in the iodide group. In both studies, there was a slightly greater goitre reduction in the iodate group, but this never reached significance. In a study (<LINK REF="STD-Ngogang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ngogang 1993</LINK>) that compared salt iodised using potassium iodate with intramuscular oil with a similar iodine content, a reduction in goitre of 83.3% was observed after seven months in the potassium iodate group compared with 93.3% in the iodised oil group.</P>
<P>OTHER OUTCOMES. Urinary iodine excretion and TSH values were not assessed. Adverse events were assessed only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>); toxic effects and Jod-Basedow were not found in any of the groups.</P>

<B>200 and 400 mg iodine in oral iodised poppyseed oil (Lipiodol) </B>were compared in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Abuye-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abuye 1995</LINK>. Goitre rate was reduced by 35.1% and 40.5% at 13 and 30 months in the 200 mg group, compared to 40.5% and 29.7% in the 400 mg group. Statistical analyses were not done. The authors suggest that 200 mg was as effective as 400 mg. Urinary iodine excretion in the 400 mg group was higher than in the 200 mg group. Statistical analyses were not done.</P>
<P>
<B>120, 240, 480, and 960 mg iodine in oral iodised poppyseed oil (Lipiodol) </B>supplementation were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>; higher urinary iodine excretion and higher percent change from baseline with higher doses were found (after 5 months, increase in excretion 7.1%, 269.6%, 409.5% and 447.8% for 120, 240, 480 and 960 mg of iodine), but this was not significant. TSH changes from baseline showed a relation to dose (37.5%, 35.7%, 45.9%, and 47.3% for 120, 240, 480, and 960 mg of iodine). TSH levels were significantly lower after treatment compared to baseline.</P>

<B>200, 400, and 800 mg iodine in oral iodised peanut oil (Yodiol)</B> were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Untoro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Untoro 1999</LINK>. The authors measured thyroid volume after 50 weeks. Thyroid volume after treatment decreased progressively with increasing dose (3.64 ml, 3.24 ml, and 3.21 ml with 200, 400, and 800 mg of iodine) and reduction of thyroid volume was greater with increasing doses (23.1%, 26.6%, and 33.5%). The reduction was significant for the highest dose.</P>
<P>
<B>Different doses of potassium iodide</B>, different total doses and different time intervals of application were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Todd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1998</LINK>. The four treatment groups were: A: 8.7 mg iodine biweekly, total dose 235 mg/year; B: 29.7 mg monthly, total dose 386 mg/year; C: 148 mg every 3 months, total dose 593 mg/year; D: 382 mg every 6 months, total dose 764 mg/year. The greatest reduction in thyroid volume was found in group A (biweekly iodine, lowest total dose). A significant decrease in thyroid volume was found when comparing groups A and B (by 23.7 versus 13.3%). The authors concluded that potassium iodide was effective at a dose of 30 mg monthly or 8 mg weekly; the time interval between doses seemed to be an important factor, the dose itself needed not be very large. Change in height was greatest in the two groups with regular but small doses (A and B), but differences between groups were not significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Salt with different doses of iodine</B> was compared by <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>. Salt with a fixed iodine content (24 to 28 ppm iodine) reduced goitre rate by 68% and 84% after 12 and 18 months, market salt with varying iodine content (13 to 47 ppm iodine) reduced goitre rate by 20% and 44% at the same time points. Market salt had varying iodine content, during the first nine months of the trial its iodine content was higher than that of the distributed iodised salt. The authors suggest that a constant intake of fixed doses of iodised salt results in greater reductions in goitre rate than use of salt with variable iodine content. Significant differences in median urinary iodine levels were found between the two treatment groups. Urinary iodine excretion was constant in the distributed iodised salt group (220 µg/L) and varied in the market salt group (90-380 µg/L).</P>

In one study, the rate of reduction of total goitre rate was greater in the boys than in girls for both doses used (<LINK REF="STD-Abuye-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abuye 1995</LINK>). The authors suggest that this was probably due to a larger initial goitre size in girls.</P>
<P>In both sexes the prevalence of goitre in children tended to increase with age up to puberty. After puberty, thyroid enlargement persisted in girls, whereas it tended to regress in boys (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Wahab-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Wahab 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pichard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pichard 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Abuye-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abuye 1995</LINK> mentioned a smaller reduction in goitre rate among children aged 11 to 16 years than among children aged 4 to 10 years.</P>

Such reversibility may have been due to a smaller number of cells and smaller cell size (<LINK REF="STD-Abuye-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abuye 1995</LINK>). In goitrous participants, both retention and elimination of iodine were significantly increased and duration of effectiveness was longer (<LINK REF="STD-Furnee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Furnee 1994</LINK>).

<P>No systematic differences were seen in outcomes between studies with short, medium or long term outcome assessment (except for progressive changes in urinary iodine after single applications of iodised oil). A number of the longer term studies were designed to assess the duration of a protective effect of single applications of an iodine supplement, and only a small number of studies assessed long term continuous supplementation.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">SUMMARY</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-six prospective controlled trials were related to our question, including 16 randomised studies. However, most of the studies were classified as being of low quality, with only six studies deemed to be of moderate quality. Most studies used iodised oil as a supplement (in oral or intramuscular form), but other supplements, such as iodised salt, iodised water, oral sodium iodide, oral iodine solution, oral tablets of potassium iodide, oral iodine tablets and iodine supplemented formula for babies were also used. The intervention groups were compared to a non-supplemented control group, different doses or different forms of iodine supplementation. Numbers of participants in the individual studies ranged from 60 to over 7500. Most studies had over hundred participants. All studies examined children or they examined the general population and gave separate data for children. Children included newborn infants, but mostly school children were considered.</P>
<P>There was a clear tendency towards goitre reduction with iodine supplementation; this was reported as statistically significant in five of 21 studies. Reduction was between 23% and 72% in these trials. Differences in physical development were generally not seen during the time periods investigated, except in one study where significant differences were found for two parameters of physical stamina. Results for differences in cognitive and psychomotor measures where mixed, with some studies showing a positive intervention effect and others not showing a significant difference. There was a suggestion (although not all parameters reached clear significance) that infant mortality was lowered after iodine supplementation. <BR/>
<BR/>Of fourteen studies measuring iodine excretion, eight showed a significant increase compared to the comparison group. Urinary iodine excretion after supplementation was mostly sufficient (according to the levels recommended by the WHO) in the intervention groups of the studies. TSH levels showed a trend towards reduction, which was significant in one study. In about 135 children (of 7403 exposed, i.e. 1.8%) adverse effects were found. Most of the adverse effects appeared only in the intervention group and were minor and transient, including transient submandibular swelling, sour taste, headache, abdominal pain, sore cheeks, local reactions, pain and stiffness at injection sites. Only few cases of iodism were found in the intervention group of a study, using relatively high doses of iodine (1690 to 3384 mg, by age). Anti-thyroid auto-antibodies were found in both the intervention and control group of one study (giving 1.5 mg of iodine every two weeks for 12 months). None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. Costs were not assessed.</P>
<P>Studies comparing oral iodised oil with intramuscular injection found a trend towards greater goitre reduction and higher urinary iodine excretion in the intramuscular groups, but this was not significant. Goitre reduction with potassium iodate group was slightly but not significantly greater than with potassium iodide. Comparing iodised oils with similar iodine contents resulted in no differences in thyroid volume, but using a different oil with a higher iodine content in one trial resulted in significantly greater iodine excretion. In trials comparing different doses there was a trend for higher doses being followed by greater goitre reduction and increased iodine excretion; however, regular intake of smaller doses seemed to be more effective than a single intake of large doses.</P>

<P>
<BR/>Apart from the methodological problems outlined above and listed in the study quality table, other methodological problems included small samples sizes (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_hles-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Böhles 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>), assignment to study groups according to the choice of mothers of treated infants (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_hles-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Böhles 1993</LINK>), and short periods of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Malone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2002</LINK>). Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marine-1917" TYPE="STUDY">Marine 1917</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scrimshaw-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Scrimshaw 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCullagh-1963" TYPE="STUDY">McCullagh 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pretell-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Pretell 1969</LINK>) were very old, and prevention practices and assessment techniques will have been very different at the time compared to current practices.</P>
<P>There are also issues concerning outcome assessment. In most trials, goitre rates have been assessed by palpation and only very few studies used objective ultrasound methods. However, palpation methods may be unreliable when applied to small thyroids, especially in children (<LINK REF="STD-Benmiloud-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benmiloud 1994</LINK>) and may not be suitable when measuring reduction in goitre size. When measuring thyroid volume sonographically in children it should be kept in mind that thyroid volume increases by about 10% per year of normal growth. As concerns measuring iodine status, studies generally concentrated on measuring urinary iodine levels - presumably because these measurements can be easily and quickly obtained. However, these values will not reflect long term iodine status and therefore other indicators should be used, for example, thyroglobulin levels or iodine excretion profiles, to get a more accurate picture of iodine status.</P>
<P>More global problems have also been highlighted and should be kept in mind. These include the fact that, iodised salt may lose its iodine content during storage and cooking (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2002</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Furnee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Furnee 1994</LINK>), presence of intestinal parasites reduced the duration of a protective effect of iodine and larger amounts of subcutaneous fat increased the duration of a protective effect of the supplement (due to a greater retention of iodine). Also, school-based programmes in developing countries may only reach healthy children and those from higher socioeconomic classes.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Regional issues</HEADING>
<P>While this review included studies both from developing and developed countries, the vast majority of studies was from developing countries. While iodine deficiency still exists in both developing and developed countries, the problems encountered will be quite different. Iodine deficiency in some (often remote) regions of the third world is often severe, and there are considerable difficulties in putting systems into place to ensure long term iodine sufficiency (such as salt iodisation programmes, which can suffer from problems of adequate delivery, acceptance and quality control). In this situation, intermittent solutions such as single applications of iodised oil appear to be necessary and effective. In the developed world where systems to ensure iodine sufficiency are in place, problems in areas where moderate iodine deficiency persists nevertheless will be more related to systems for ensuring uptake - this issue was addressed by none of the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different supplements</HEADING>
<P>Salt iodisation programmes appear to be the most accepted method for long term control of iodine deficiency. The question however remains whether this is really the most adequate means of supplementation in children. Two of the salt iodisation studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996a</LINK>) suggest that salt intake in children may not be high enough to ensure adequate iodine supply, and newborn babies and infants do not consume any iodised salt at all. However, in this context the study by <LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_hles-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Böhles 1993</LINK> seems to confirm that iodine supply in breast milk is adequate (presumably as long as the mother herself is not iodine deficient). Where there are concerns regarding the iodine status of infants, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Cobra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cobra 1997</LINK> suggests that iodine supplementation can relatively easily be given as part of a more general neonatal programme including immunisation etc.</P>
<P>When comparing intramuscular injection of iodised oil with oral application, the evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in effect between these two forms. Oral application would therefore appear preferable, as it is cheaper, does not carry a risk of infection through needle contamination (e.g. hepatitis, HIV), does not involve any pain, and can be distributed by untrained personnel. In isolated communities with an urgent need for iodine prophylaxis, iodised oil programmes can be implemented rapidly, while setting up salt iodisation programmes requires a much longer time scale. When it comes to assessing the effects of different types of oils against each other, there is limited evidence as only few studies have been done directly comparing different oils and it is unclear to what extent the doses/schedules used for the different oils were comparable (e.g. Lipiodol Ultrafluide 400-490 mg/ml, Ethiodol 475-490 mg/ml, Oriodol 540 mg/ml, Yodiol 400 mg/ml, Neohydrol 39-41% w/w). It should be kept in mind however that some oils are more expensive than others. Water iodisation seems to be another means of effective iodine supplementation that can be set up relatively easily and cheaply, even in remote areas, having the advantage of reaching the whole community (which will not be the case in school programmes).</P>
<P>Another issue seems to be the frequency of application, especially with iodised oils. When using single doses of iodised oil, larger doses do not necessarily provide longer term protection, but more iodine will be lost in the urine early after the application (<LINK REF="STD-Abuye-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abuye 1995</LINK>) and it has been suggested that it may be more effective to give smaller doses more frequently (<LINK REF="STD-Todd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1998</LINK>). In most studies, between 200 and 500 mg of iodised oil was given and it was suggested that this provides protection for about 6 months to 2 years, with iodine status gradually deteriorating.</P>
<P>Considering the existence of possible differential effects on boys and girls, different age groups and children with or without preexisting goitre, different supplementation schedules may also be appropriate for different population groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that iodine supplementation is an effective means of decreasing goitre rates and improving iodine status in children. Indications of positive effects on physical and mental development and mortality were seen, although results were not always significant. Adverse effects appeared in 1.8% of the exposed children, but these were generally minor and transient. Most studies considered iodised oils and it appears that these present an effective means of preventing iodine deficiency, especially in remote areas where iodine prophylaxis is urgently needed. Use of oral rather than intramuscular iodised oil seems preferable in these situations. Only limited information is available about other forms of iodine supplementation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High quality randomised controlled trials conducted according to the CONSORT criteria and investigating relevant long term outcome measures (including those relating to physical and mental development and mortality) are needed to address the question of the best vehicle, dose and schedule of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings. The following additional questions should be addressed:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>How can long term supplementation programmes be implemented in developing countries?</LI>
<LI>What are the optimal methods for achieving iodine sufficiency in developed countries, where supplementation programmes are already in place?</LI>
<LI>Is iodised salt really a good method of supplementation in children, especially small children, who will have a low salt consumption?</LI>
<LI>What are ideal doses and schedules of iodine supplementation for different age groups and boys versus girls?</LI>
