<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:20:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral prostaglandin E2 is no more effective than other methods of induction but has more adverse effects.</P>
<P>Induction of labour is sometimes considered beneficial in some clinical circumstances, e.g., when the baby is not growing properly, when there is pre-eclampsia or when gestation goes beyond the normal length of pregnancy. There are many varying methods used to try to stimulate labour including administration of drugs, mechanical methods such as sweeping of the membranes, and more natural methods like nipple stimulation and having sex. Care needs to be taken to balance the stimulation of labour without over-stimulating and causing the baby difficulties. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a hormone given either by mouth or by insertion through the vagina to prepare and stimulate the cervix and bring on labour. This review looked at oral PGE2 compared with no intervention, and compared with several other methods of induction. The review identified 19 studies involving 2688 women, looking at eight differing comparisons. The review found that none of the trials assessed the effectiveness of oral PGE2 in inducing labour, but overall the trials found that PGE2 caused more frequent gastrointestinal adverse effects, particularly vomiting. There were no clear advantages to oral PGE2 over other methods used to bring on labour, except that women may prefer a method that does not require an intravenous infusion. Over stimulation of the baby may possibly be a possible problem with PGE2, but the increased incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects do not favor its use.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There were 19 studies included in the review. Of these 15 included a comparison using either oral or intravenous oxytocin with or without amniotomy. The quality of studies reviewed was not high. Only seven studies had clearly described allocation concealment. Only two studies stated that providers or participants, or both, were blinded to treatment group.</P>
<P>For the outcome of vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, in the composite comparison of oral PGE2 versus all oxytocin treatments (oral and intravenous, with and without amniotomy), there was a trend favoring oxytocin treatments (relative risk (RR) 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 4.48).</P>
<P>For the outcome of cesarean section, in the comparison of PGE2 versus no treatment or placebo, PGE2 was favored (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.98). Otherwise, there were no significant differences between groups for this outcome. </P>
<P>Oral prostaglandin was associated with vomiting across all comparison groups. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-08 13:40:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-08 13:35:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prostaglandins are hormones with a number of functions, and are normally produced at various sites in the body. They are derived from a fatty acid, arachidonic acid, which is generally available when needed. The role of endogenous prostaglandins in cervical ripening and initiation of labour was discovered in the 1960s.</P>
<P>Synthetically produced prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) and F2alpha (PGF2a) have been available for oral administration in several developed countries since the early 1970s. By 1977 five small trials had been published regarding use of PGE2 for cervical ripening. These were reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1989</LINK>) with the conclusion that the data failed to demonstrate suitability for this purpose. Vaginal administration has become the preferred route for the purpose of cervical ripening. PGE2 has also been studied as an agent for the induction of labour. The use of PGE2 as an agent for cervical ripening and labour induction is the subject of this review.</P>
<P>The gastrointestinal side-effects of oral prostaglandins are important, and apparently more pronounced for PGF2a (<LINK REF="STD-Yeung-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardized protocol. A review of the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol is reviewed separately, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>).

<P>Clinical trials comparing oral prostaglandin E2 for labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods of labour induction. This review includes only induction methods listed with lower numbers on a predefined list of methods of labour induction (<I>see</I> 'Methods of the review'). Studies comparing a low or constant dosing of oral prostaglandin with a high or incremental dosing regimen are also included. Additionally, studies comparing oral prostaglandin with oral oxytocin, with and without amniotomy, are also included. We have included only studies that have some form of random allocation of participants to study groups, and that report at least one of the prestated outcomes.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:22:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses are limited to the primary outcomes:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) cesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components will be explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see </I>below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of effectiveness:</HEADING>
<P>(6) cervix unfavorable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complications:</HEADING>
<P>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side-effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum hemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of satisfaction:</HEADING>
<P>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>'Uterine rupture' will include all clinically significant ruptures of unscarred or scarred uteri. Trivial scar dehiscence noted incidentally at the time of surgery will be excluded.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes may appear in individual primary reviews, but will not contribute to the secondary reviews.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes will be sought, only those with data will appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we have used the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than 5 contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with FHR changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<P>A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different categories of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged by category of woman, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We have therefore developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction will be done in a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardized methodology. The data will then be extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by category of woman.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) will include only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<LI>nulliparity or multiparity;</LI>
<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>cervix favorable, unfavorable or undefined.</LI>

<P>The secondary reviews will include all methods of labour induction for each of the categories of women for which subgroup analysis has been done in the primary reviews, and will include only five primary outcome measures. There will thus be six secondary reviews of methods of labour induction in the following groups of women:</P>
<OL>
<LI>nulliparous, intact membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>nulliparous, ruptured membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>multiparous, intact membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>multiparous, ruptured membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>previous cesarean section, intact membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>previous cesarean section, ruptured membranes (unfavorable cervix, favorable cervix, cervix not defined).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Each time a primary review is updated with new data, those secondary reviews which include data which have changed, will also be updated.</P>
<P>The trials included in the primary reviews first published in 2001 were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (<I>see </I>above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardized across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardized form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardized data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous review authors in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials, i.e. woman, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels were sought.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis was performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rests with the review authors of primary reviews and has been clearly documented. Once missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting is poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual review authors for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>
<P>For this update, the additional reports identified from the updated search were assessed by one author.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>There were 33 studies identified by the search strategy that were excluded. For details, <I>see </I>the table of 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. In four studies, allocation concealment was clearly inadequate due to randomization methods using alternation or odd or even medical record number. Six studies presented no outcomes of interest according to the review protocol. Six studies were not randomized trials. Two studies did not include oral prostaglandins. Two studies did not correspond to the topic of review, describing outcomes with policies of routine induction versus expectant management. One study was planned but not carried out. Insufficient data were available to assess the remainder.</P>
<P>Four studies were of two oral prostaglandin regimens that were considered too similar for meaningful comparison. <LINK REF="STD-Lorrain-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lorrain 1982</LINK> studied 'synthetic' versus 'natural' prostaglandin. <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1975</LINK> studied swallowed tablet versus oral solution. <LINK REF="STD-Thiery--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Thiery 1977</LINK> studied swallowed versus sublingual administration of tablets. In none of these studies was there any important difference described in outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1991</LINK> used the same oral PGE2 regimen immediately versus the next morning at 9 a.m.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Somell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Somell 1983</LINK> considered both cervical ripening for two days and then induction with oral PGE2, compared with no treatment for ripening and intravenous (IV) oxytocin for induction. The combination comparison group (no treatment/IV oxytocin) is one not contemplated in the study protocol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>There were 19 studies identified meeting the inclusion criteria. For details, <I>see</I> the table of 'Characteristics of included studies'. PGE2 was the oral prostaglandin used in all of these studies. The comparisons identified were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>oral PGE2 versus no treatment (n = three studies, 195 women);</LI>
<LI>oral PGE2 versus vaginal PGE2 (n = three studies, 108 women);</LI>
<LI>oral PGE2 versus cervical PGE2 (n = two studies, 80 women);</LI>

<LI>oral PGE2 versus oral oxytocin plus amniotomy (n = two studies, 223 women);</LI>
<LI>oral PGE2 dose incremental or high dose versus oral PGE2 constant or low dose (n = two studies, 46 women).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A few studies included multiple (three or four) comparison groups.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Somell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Somell 1987</LINK> included four groups. The women were first divided into two groups to receive oral prostaglandin or placebo for cervical ripening. Afterward, these two groups were further divided into induction groups to receive either oral prostaglandin or IV oxytocin. For this review, only the two groups receiving oral PGE2 and IV oxytocin without prior cervical ripening are included.</P>
<P>There are six studies currently excluded which may be included at a future date if the authors can supply missing data.</P>

<P>Only for the two studies with a double-blind comparison to placebo was blinding described. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Somell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Somell 1987</LINK>, it is assumed that the blinding only applied to the cervical ripening phase of the study, and not the induction portion versus intravenous oxytocin.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Of the five primary outcome measures, only cesarean section was consistently reported (in all but <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1976</LINK>). For the comparison versus no treatment or placebo, PGE2 was favored (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.98). Otherwise, there were no significant differences between groups for this outcome.</P>
<P>Vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours was included as an outcome measure in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westergaard-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Westergaard 1983a</LINK>). Individual comparisons tended to favor other treatments without reaching statistical significance. In the composite of oral PGE2 versus all oxytocin treatments, there was a trend favoring other treatments (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 4.48).</P>
<P>Uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes was an outcome reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Massil-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Massil 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulstein-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ulstein 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westergaard-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Westergaard 1983a</LINK>). Of these, only one (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1976</LINK>) reported cases in either group, all three of the cases in women receiving PGE2. The result was that in the composite of oral PGE2 versus all oxytocin treatments, there was a trend in favor of oxytocin treatments, though with a very wide confidence interval (RR 7.00 95% CI 0.37 to 132.10).<BR/>
<BR/>Perinatal death was not consistently included as an outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Somell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Somell 1987</LINK> reported two deaths that were attributed to congenital malformations. The only study reporting what might be classified as severe perinatal morbidity, was the outcome called 'intrauterine asphyxia', by <LINK REF="STD-Ulstein-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ulstein 1979</LINK>. There was no difference between the PGE2 and the oral oxytocin groups in that study.</P>
<P>Serious maternal morbidity or death was reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1992</LINK>, which stated that there was none in either treatment group (oral PGE2 versus intravenous (IV) oxytocin).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gastrointestinal side-effects</HEADING>
<P>Gastrointestinal side-effects were frequently reported in the studies reviewed. Often nausea and vomiting was reported as a composite outcome. In these cases, the data were entered under the variable vomiting. Gastrointestinal side-effects were more frequent for women treated with oral PGE2 than with other treatments in all comparisons, most of which reached statistical significance.</P>

It is not surprising that in Hauth's study of oral PGE2 versus no treatment for the first 12 hours, then oxytocin augmentation in both groups if needed, oxytocin was needed more often in the no treatment group. In the other two studies there was not a significant difference in use of oxytocin augmentation.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review is limited by the quality of the available studies. Allocation concealment was not clearly described in most studies and, when it was, significant potential for bias still existed due to lack of blinding. A further limitation is that the number of participants in aggregate, is not large.</P>
<P>For the five primary outcome measures, only cesarean section was consistently reported. The results of this meta-analysis trend in favor of oxytocin. This cannot be firmly concluded, however. </P>
<P>Of the secondary outcomes, results in favor of all oxytocin treatments regarding gastrointestinal side-effects are consistent enough to be conclusive. Other secondary outcomes do not clearly favor oral prostaglandin or other treatments.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to demonstrate superiority of high or incremental dosing regimens of oral PGE2 over low or constant dosing. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 22:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Oral PGE2 is not more effective than oxytocin for achieving delivery within 24 hours of labor induction. Gastrointestinal side-effects are more frequent with PGE2. There is no clear evidence favoring either oral PGE2 or oxytocin regimens regarding safety of women or their infants. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-06 22:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Little further research is likely to be forthcoming comparing oral PGE2 to other regimens. Though some women may prefer an oral route of administration of agents for induction of labor, oral misoprostol (synthetic prostaglandin) is likely to supercede the oral preparations of PGE2 that are in current use.</P>
