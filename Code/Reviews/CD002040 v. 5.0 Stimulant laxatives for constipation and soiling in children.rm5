<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Stimulant laxatives for constipation and soiling in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Constipation is a common childhood disorder traditionally treated with a combination of medical and behavioural approaches. There is insufficient evidence on the use and effectiveness of stimulant laxatives for the treatment of childhood constipation. More research is required.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Constipation is a common childhood disorder and 30% of British parents will report constipation at some time in their child's lives. Those with mild constipation will often respond to increase in dietary fibre and fluid intake or treatment with osmotic or lubricant laxatives. A less prolonged treatment period is required in this group unlike those with more complicated and severe constipation. Chronic constipation can lead to megarectum and subsequently to overflow soiling or encopresis. This extremely distressing condition affects approximately 2 % of 5 year olds and can precipitate considerable behavioral, social and psychological difficulties. Ninety-five per cent of children who soil have functional constipation and overflow soiling (encopresis). The aim of treatment is to abolish soiling and establish a normal bowel habit thus preventing recurrence. Treatment of constipation and soiling has traditionally combined medical and behavioural approaches. Initially, the bowel needs to be emptied of impacted faeces. This is usually achieved by oral or rectal laxative therapy. Subsequently, regular bowel actions need to be maintained and drug therapy using osmotic and stimulant laxatives may be repeated for many months. Behavioural approaches encourage toilet use and may address associated psychological problems. Dietary advice may also be required. A number of different stimulant laxatives are currently in use in this difficult to treat group of children and the aim of this review is to examine the evidence to guide their use.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials which includes CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE, together with information from hand searching paediatric journals was searched. Search criteria were as follows: constipation, soiling, encopresis, stimulant laxative, senna, docusate sodium, sodium picosulphate, child, children, paediatric, pediatric. The boolean AND and OR operators were used to combine these terms as appropriate.</P>
<P>2. Known professionals in the field were contacted with a view to the possibility of acquiring other useful references.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All identified studies considered for inclusion in the review were to be examined independently by both reviewers and the selection criteria applied. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No suitable trials were identified for inclusion. Three studies were identified as potentially relevant. However, these did not comply with the inclusion criteria set out for this review. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Berg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Berg 1983</LINK> was not randomised or double blind. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1975</LINK> used subjects with an age range of 4 to 90. Efforts are being made to contact the authors of this trial for a possible break down of ages. If it is possible to separate out the children from the adults in this study the results may be included in this review at a later stage. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Perkins-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Perkins 1977</LINK> was a crossover trial of very short duration (one week each of senna, no treatment, lactulose) which was not double blinded.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Thirty per cent of parents report constipation at some stage in their child's early life. This is often transient, but in some, there is progression to longstanding severe constipation with megarectum and overflow soiling. This results in considerable distress for the child and family, social isolation, bullying and in severe cases restriction of growth. Treatment as outlined above consists of a combined approach of education, behaviour modification and medical treatment with laxatives. Many parents express concern about the use of laxatives in their children and doctors are sometimes reluctant to prescribe stimulant laxatives, especially to the younger child. This public and professional concern appears to have resulted at times in inadequate treatment of constipation and slow resolution of symptoms. </P>
<P>Whilst many children with mild constipation will respond to osmotic or lubricant laxatives those with chronic severe constipation, often with overflow soiling, will require the addition of stimulant laxatives. Many " personal practice" guidelines exist and a number of stimulant laxatives are available for this more difficult to treat group. This review has failed to identify any trials that significantly contribute to the management of this group of children. </P>
<P>The paper by Perkins and colleagues compares the effect of lactulose and senna in children attending general practice. Whilst randomised for the first week of treatment, there is no evidence of blinding. This study compares drugs with very different therapeutic effects and doses of senna in excess of the normal starting dose were used. Not surprisingly children on senna had a higher rate of side effects, particularly abdominal pain and diarrhoea than those on lactulose. Although significantly more " normal" stools occurred in the lactulose group than the senna group the authors suggest that the total number of stools passed in each group were equal. Whilst this paper suggests that lactulose is effective with few side effects in uncomplicated constipation it doesn't contribute to the purpose of this review. </P>
<P>Berg and colleagues compared senokot and placebo in children with soiling who were also receiving behavioural treatment. Senna appeared to confer no benefit above placebo or behavioural treatment alone but no attempt was made to assess whether the children were constipated at the a start of the treatment programme and the trial was unblinded.</P>
<P>The prokinetic agent, cisapride has also been used in children with constipation. It is not a traditional stimulant laxative and has been withdrawn from use because of potential cardiac side effects. This drug was therefore not included in this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-17 11:38:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current UK practice, to treat constipation and soiling with osmotic and stimulant laxatives is well established and several practice guidelines exist (<LINK REF="REF-Clayden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayden 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-D-_x002b_-Th-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">D + Th 2000</LINK>). However there is no evidence base to support this practice nor to guide the choice of laxatives that are used. Many of the drugs are prescribed outside their licensed indications or in doses that exceed those recommended by manufacturers.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-17 11:38:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The management of this common problem may be undertaken in community and hospital settings by a wide variety of personnel. The protracted natural history of this condition and associated psychological and behavioural problems make this a difficult area for research. The need clearly exists to establish a more secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs. These trials will need to be designed to minimise the effects of other interventions such as behavioural and psychological modification and level of professional support within the clinic.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review of behavioural and psychological approaches to this problem has been completed (<LINK REF="REF-Brazzelli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazzelli 2006</LINK>). A systematic review of the use of osmotic laxatives is also required.</P>
