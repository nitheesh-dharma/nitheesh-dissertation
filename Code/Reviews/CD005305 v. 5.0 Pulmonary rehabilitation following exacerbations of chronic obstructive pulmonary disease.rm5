I agree with the ME that the term used &amp;#8220;very little extensive&amp;#8221; is not strictly acceptable grammatically in English . Her option suggested of &amp;#8220;extensive&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;moderately extensive&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;slightly extensive&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;not extensive&amp;#8221; would be a good alternative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT 13/05/16 - I have accepted all track changes (we can use Archie to see the 'tracked changes' version still).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please edit the abstract text further so that the word count is under 1000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- to check the word count you can go to File/Reports/Validation report - it is good to ensure there are no Errors and also no warnings before choosing 'Submit for Editorial approval' - for example, it may be advisable to reduce the number of Figures you have down to 6, if practical to do so, as more than 6 most likely won't look that good on publication - see what you think and if there's any room for changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I have activated the headings that are required within the Background also, please copy and paste text and further complete these headings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please also add the headings to the Plain language summary as suggested by Emma below: http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf but in brief headings such as 'Review Question, Background, Study Characteristics, Key Results, Quality of the Evidence, Conclusions' can work well - obviously move around the text you have already written to go under the respective headings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I have edited some of the text very slightly also to get it ready for style checking etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make these changes and then choose 'submit for editorial approval' when you check in from RevMan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ilo: (May 12, 2016): decided not to downgrade confidence for HRQL and 6MWD but put a note that we did not so because the possible bias does not reduce the confidence in the estimates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elena (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;April 21st 2016): I updated all the data in 6MWD from Liao (sent by email). Pending data from Troosters and correct text accordingly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;pril 8th 2016: CJC removed unchecked studies from the subgroups and renamed comprehensive as extensive in the subgroup labels. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think the quality of life has to be moderate quality of evidence as it is subjective and there is no active control arm. also the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; same argument and heterogeneity in 6MWD makes that outcome moderate too doesn't it. See my suggested changes in SoF and abstract and main text. I have used yellow highlighter for my suggested changes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 CJC added new Forest plots 1.37 to 1.40 with separated old and new trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz S notes 10/06/2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have edited study flow diagram (removed 'of' in the boxes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have edited/updated search methods section with current methods; added standard appendix to describe source/methods of Airways trials register; and moved Airways Register search strategy to appendices. I believe the additional searches referred to you in your text were conducted for the original version, but were they conducted for the update? I don't believe so as the number of new references you screend (352) corresponds to the number of references I sent you from the Airways Register. Therefore, I have amended the methods to reflect this. Please check to make sure you are happy with the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You refer to 'handsearching completed in April 2015'. Is this handsearching of reference lists atc? If so, this date can go in the 'additional sources section'. I have moved it for you, but if this refers to other handsearching, please described what this handsearching is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our standard methods we state that Clinicatrials.gov and the WHO trials portal were searched, so I have included this statement in the search methods section. Please confirm this was done. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma J notes 5/6/15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLS needs to be re-written in accordance with http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf (including appropriate headings, etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EW notes.&lt;/b&gt; Consider writing the background under the standard headings which are now highlighted - it's not essential for updates, but preferred by Cochrane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the I2 values where there is substantial heterogeneity - have already done so for CRQ mastery domain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's mandatory to have a comment on adverse events in the abstracts - I copied and pasted one up from the main text, please check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC notes on third draft uploaded to workflow and sent to Milo on May 6th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC notes on second draft:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added the subgroup Forest plots to the outcome groups so that the Risks of Bias show better. I have also added in green the results of the test for subgroup differences for admissions and mortality (the first is significant the second is not). I would be happy to have separate SoF tables for comprehensive and less-comprehensive as long as the text makes clear that the subgroup test is not significant for most outcomes..... Some rewriting is needed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma W notes on second draft &lt;/b&gt;- I started going though my usual editorial checks, when you may have preferred we look at the high level content only. I hope the following notes are helpful even if they were already on your to do list. I want get as much of this review done before ATS as you are in the mood for working on it now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Dunstan incorrectly excluded as a duplicate report of already included study - the abstract is now listed as a reference belonging to &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Greening 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Greening 2014&lt;/a&gt;. I updated the excluded studies accordingly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to lose some words form the abstract - check you are under 1000 using the validation report. I have added some additional comments inline. I would suggest removing some of the detail about different domains on the CRQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain language study eventually needs to be written in accord with guidance http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several headings were missing. I activated them and either copied and pasted text into the correct place, or added some standard wording where you had used those methods but not reported it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added a funnel plot for analysis 1.6 because it is normal practice where there are 10 or more studies. This is figure 4. Please consider adding a sentence or two about this to the discussion of publication bias.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a big chunk of stuff about heterogeneity of pulmonary rehab plans and how you downgraded them under measures of treatment effects. Some if this belongs in the background. The part about 'downgrading' - this needs to go in the subgroup analysis section and you need to be clear that this is something developed specifically for this review (unless it's pre-existing in which case most of it can be added to the background perhaps?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Included studies is quite sparse compared to some reviews. Please consider if there is anything else you would want to know about the applicability of the results of this review to an individual patient in your care and if so, revise accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add information about risk of bias of remaining domains under the headings (which I added)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need to complete the SOF table and then add statement about the quality of the evidence for each outcome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the table for the subgrouping is too important for the appendix in my view, so I moved to an additional table where it will appear alongside the results. Furthermore, in the subgroups, you have divided into comprehensive and less comprehensive programs - the table should also be divided this way in my view for simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added the subgroup for 6MWD - check that the studies are in the correct grouping for this and all subgroups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started fixing some reference issues where the same reference was listed twice. unfortunately some of them went missing and became 'new reference' in the text - I have highlighted these and added the correct reference where I could please check and re-link the references.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between protocol and review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need to be transparent about this - I think you have changed quite a bit so list as much as possible here before submission to editorial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in particular the classification into higher and lower intensity intervention needs adding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W notes - pre-submission. 17/04/2015&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's quite a lot of work to do....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abstract/discussion etc needs redrafting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complete PRISMA diagram which is added as figure 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add funding source from trials to the characteristics if included studies table&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;summary of findings table needs adding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;risk of bias is lacking some key headings - have added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've added the subgroup analysis = please check you are happy with how I interpreted it e.g. I took the dyspnoea and total domains for the 2 x QoL outcomes respectively. Also not sure if you wanted to keep the combined analyses as the primary analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Sept 25th. I am happy to sign of this update, I have run spell check and relabeled the graphs. To Emma for final copy-editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris 8th Sept New Figures added for admission and mortality and NNT updated. Caption added to the text and linked to figures 3 and 5. RoB tables need text adding where there are blanks showing in the &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;02&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma 09 August 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write description of 'results of the search' under the new activated heading. See Cochrane Handbook section 4.5 (http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/) for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RevMan has a neat facility for inserting analysis results. If you click 'Format &amp;gt; Insert analysis results' on the menu you get the results in the recommended format - nice and uniform and correct! Please do go through the review and insert the results like this. I have done one and highlighted it in yellow for you to see. At the same time also insert a link to the analysis for each of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - you will see that I have activated some headings in RevMan and cut and paste your discussion into it. I have done this quickly and without amending any of the text. The discussion is long and would benefit form being broken up in the way - although it will require a bit of a re-write so that it makes sense, I think this will be of benefit to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add abbreviations to footnotes of characteristics of included studies table.(CRQ, 6MWD, BODE, ATS, ERS...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have made a good attempt at the risk of bias, but you need to write something in all boxes of the risk of bias table - even if only 'not described.' Figure 7.6 and associated text for the Cochrane Handbook may be helpful in working out what to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please accept all the tracked changes before checking the review in [Edit &amp;gt;global replace &amp;gt; globally accept all tracked changes].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;many thanks for your hard work so far, I think incorporating the suggestions will really tighten the review up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note from Chris: Figure 3 needs to be revised using the new Odds Ratios and control event rates in Visual Rx. Is the mean duration still 34 weeks with the new studies added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for addressing these Milo. Table 4 was in the Behnke paper but if you have verified the results with the authors that is fine. Please either remove the references listed as unlinked when you run the validation report from the File menu, or put links to the references into the text. This will then be ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Oct 29th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 13th Peer Review comments to address please:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. My main concern is terminology:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Why was the term respiratory rehabilitation chosen? A previous Cochrane review used the term &amp;#8216;Pulmonary Rehab&amp;#8217; and most guidelines also use this term&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Consistency throughout the document - under &amp;#8216;Effects of interventions &amp;#8211; Mortality&amp;#8217; the phrase &amp;#8216;Pulmonary Rehab&amp;#8217; is used; this phrase is also in the header&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Primary outcome is hospital admissions ? does this mean &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; of hospital admissions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. How was &amp;quot;comprehensiveness of the rehabilitation programme&amp;quot; defined? Did a program need to include just one element (in addition to exercise) to be &amp;quot;comprehensive&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Important effect for 6MWT ? should be acknowledged that the minimal detectable difference for 6MWT is not well defined. Although these authors have recently published their own data on this topic, their findings differ from the well accepted MCID for 6MWT (54m, Redelmeier) and will need to be confirmed by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Health related quality of life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; paragraph &amp;#8211; should the &amp;#8216;Canadian Respiratory Disease Questionnaire&amp;#8217; be the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; paragraph &amp;#8211; please specify units&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; paragraph &amp;#8211; why are domain scores for SGRQ reported as effect sizes and all others reported in units?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. There was no information about completion rate, which is surprising given that &amp;quot;withdrawals&amp;quot; was a secondary outcome. We know that in stable patients the completion rate is around 75-80%. Was it different in these patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please could the authors address the above comments from the Peer Reviewer. This has also brought to my attention the unequal weights between Man and Behnke in the CRQ outcome. I cannot see how the data entered for Behnke relates to the results in Table 4. Could the authors provide further information on the derivation of the mean difference and SE used please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC edit Sept 19th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy to sign off this review following the changes Milo has made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the references that are unlinked in the text are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;1&quot; rows=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: Devereaux 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: Jaeschke 1989&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Puhan 2008&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Puhan 2008&lt;/a&gt;a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: ter Riet 1997&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: Redelmeier 1997&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also notice that there are no characteristics in the ongoing studies table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing August 26th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is well-constructed review, and I would only suggest some minor modifications as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have highlighted the main changes in yellow in the text. Please adjust the discussion paragraph and add table of durations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: NNTs need a duration for admission and mortality, I have added these in the abstract and results text and also added some smiley face figures to demonstrate the benefits of treatment (produced by Visual Rx version 3.0). Could you put in an additional table showing study durations to help the reader? The rates of mortality and admission seem low compared to 35% and 60% annual rates in background? Do you want to comment on this in the discussion under limitations (better care than real life or less severe patients recruited are possibilities)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis: You say no pooling if there is heterogeneity of P&amp;lt;0.1. This is an unusual approach and is not reflected in the Forest plots. Do you want to change this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: The difference between acute and chronic COPD is not significant using the Altman test of interaction. Would you therefore like to tone down the contrast in the rest of the paragraph that starts with the highlighted sentence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=============================================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you define the time parameters- i.e. how long since the AE COPD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were any trials in out-patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in SGRQ in units is very large and needs comment later. How did you calculate the SD for the mean difference&amp;#160; in Murphy. In the original papers Man gives figures for the mean difference and SD but Murphy does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One decimal point seems sensible here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How recently after an AE in general? Was there any relationship of effect with time since AE COPD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May be worth studies on what components of rehabilitation are the effective ones?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did all patients have adequate treatment of exacerbations with OCS and antibiotics? How many were put on ICS/LABA and was this balanced?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 27 Jan 2005&lt;br&gt;Toby I am happy with these changes. Please thank Liz for attending to this search strategy (and the others recently).&lt;br&gt;Visual Rx reference added.&lt;br&gt;Could you check that Milo is happy with the sentence in red.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; Where possible we will also assess the number of patients who show changes that are greater than the MID, including those who show significant increase and decrease in each treatment group, and compare the net benefit between treatments.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This data may not be available but it is the best way to analyse MID changes in a dichotomous fashion.&lt;br&gt;This can go on now.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=========================================================&lt;br&gt;Reviewers Contributions: Please add other reviewers and the contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine, minor tidy up done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:38:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>: We wished to compare the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on hospital readmissions and other patient-important outcomes such as quality of life versus usual post-exacerbation care.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>: We included 20 studies involving 1477 participants with COPD. Rehabilitation programmes started in hospital in some trials and after discharge in others. These programmes showed great diversity in terms of exercise training (e.g. number of completed exercise sessions, type and intensity of exercise training), patient education (none to extensive self-management programmes) and how programmes were organised (within one setting, e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation, to across several settings, e.g. hospital, outpatient centre and home).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>: Quality of life and exercise capacity were improved by rehabilitation, and the effect was substantially larger than the minimal important difference. Results for hospital readmissions and mortality were diverse, with some studies showing that pulmonary rehabilitation reduced hospital admissions and mortality compared with usual community care (no rehabilitation), and other studies not showing such effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>: Uncertainty about reasons for differences across trials in terms of hospital readmissions and mortality led to downgrading of the quality of evidence (moderate-quality evidence for reduction in hospital readmissions and low-quality evidence for reduction in mortality). The quality of evidence was high for quality of life and exercise capacity.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>: Pulmonary rehabilitation improves quality of life and exercise capacity and is a safe intervention for patients with COPD after they have experienced an exacerbation. The reasons for diverse effects on hospital readmissions and mortality, however, are not fully clear. Future studies should explore whether the extent of the rehabilitation programme and the organisation of such programmes within specific healthcare systems (e.g. within the rehabilitation setting vs embedded in the continuum of care from hospital to home to outpatient care) determines the effects of rehabilitation after COPD exacerbations.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Guidelines have provided positive recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but recent studies indicate that postexacerbation rehabilitation may not always be effective in patients with unstable COPD.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:01:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To assess effects of pulmonary rehabilitation after COPD exacerbations on hospital admissions (primary outcome) and other patient-important outcomes (mortality, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified studies through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) and the Cochrane Airways Review Group Register of Trials. Searches were current as of 20 October 2015, and handsearches were run up to 5 April 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pulmonary rehabilitation of any duration after exacerbation of COPD versus conventional care. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes had to include at least physical exercise (endurance or strength exercise, or both). We did not apply a criterion for the minimum number of exercise sessions a rehabilitation programme had to offer to be included in the review. Control groups received conventional community care without rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We expected substantial heterogeneity across trials in terms of how extensive rehabilitation programmes were (i.e. in terms of number of completed exercise sessions; type, intensity and supervision of exercise training; and patient education), duration of follow-up (&lt; 3 months vs &#8805; 3 months) and risk of bias (generation of random sequence, concealment of random allocation and blinding); therefore, we performed subgroup analyses that were defined before we carried them out. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane in preparing this update, and we used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 13:59:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>For this update, we added 11 studies and included a total of 20 studies (1477 participants). Rehabilitation programmes showed great diversity in terms of exercise training (number of completed exercise sessions; type, intensity and supervision), patient education (from none to extensive self-management programmes) and how they were organised (within one setting, e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation, to across several settings, e.g. hospital, outpatient centre and home). In eight studies, participants completed extensive pulmonary rehabilitation, and in 12 studies, participants completed pulmonary rehabilitation ranging from not extensive to moderately extensive.</P>
<P>Eight studies involving 810 participants contributed data on hospital readmissions. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that pulmonary rehabilitation reduced hospital readmissions (pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.91), but results were heterogenous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 77%). Extensiveness of rehabilitation programmes and risk of bias may offer an explanation for the heterogeneity, but subgroup analyses were not statistically significant (P values for subgroup effects were between 0.07 and 0.11). Six studies including 670 participants contributed data on mortality. The quality of evidence was low, and the meta-analysis did not show a statistically significant effect of rehabilitation on mortality (pooled OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.67). Again, results were heterogenous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%). Subgroup analyses showed statistically significant differences in subgroup effects between trials with more and less extensive rehabilitation programmes and between trials at low and high risk for bias, indicating possible explanations for the heterogeneity. Hospital readmissions and mortality studies newly included in this update showed, on average, significantly smaller effects of rehabilitation than were seen in earlier studies.</P>
<P>High-quality evidence suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation improves health-related quality of life. The eight studies that used St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) reported a statistically significant effect on SGRQ total score, which was above the minimal important difference (MID) of four points (mean difference (MD) -7.80, 95% CI -12.12 to -3.47; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 64%). Investigators also noted statistically significant and important effects (greater than MID) for the impact and activities domains of the SGRQ. Effects were not statistically significant for the SGRQ symptoms domain. Again, all of these analyses showed heterogeneity, but most studies showed positive effects of pulmonary rehabilitation, some studies showed large effects and others smaller but statistically significant effects. Trials at high risk of bias because of lack of concealment of random allocation showed statistically significantly larger effects on the SGRQ than trials at low risk of bias. High-quality evidence shows that six-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved, on average, by 62 meters (95% CI 38 to 86; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 87%). Heterogeneity was driven particularly by differences between studies showing very large effects and studies showing smaller but statistically significant effects. For both health-related quality of life and exercise capacity, studies newly included in this update showed, on average, smaller effects of rehabilitation than were seen in earlier studies, but the overall results of this review have not changed to an important extent compared with results reported in the earlier version of this review.</P>
<P>Five studies involving 278 participants explicitly recorded adverse events, four studies reported no adverse events during rehabilitation programmes and one study reported one serious event.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, evidence of high quality shows moderate to large effects of rehabilitation on health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with COPD after an exacerbation. Some recent studies showed no benefit of rehabilitation on hospital readmissions and mortality and introduced heterogeneity as compared with the last update of this review. Such heterogeneity of effects on hospital readmissions and mortality may be explained to some extent by the extensiveness of rehabilitation programmes and by the methodological quality of the included studies. Future researchers must investigate how the extent of rehabilitation programmes in terms of exercise sessions, self-management education and other components affects the outcomes, and how the organisation of such programmes within specific healthcare systems determines their effects after COPD exacerbations on hospital readmissions and mortality.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:01:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-06 13:51:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Clinical guidelines and documents of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) include positive recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations based on earlier versions of this systematic review and its included trials (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>). However, recent studies indicate that post exacerbation rehabilitation may not always be effective. In addition, concerns have arisen that pulmonary rehabilitation may not be safe shortly after exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, our aim is to update our previous systematic review by assessing the effectiveness and safety of pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbations of COPD.</P>
<P>The protocol for this Cochrane review was based on a previously published non-Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-05 10:47:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exacerbations and hospitalisations in patients with COPD represent a major health burden for both patients and healthcare systems in industrialised and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seemungal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seemungal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2000</LINK>). Acute exacerbations are the most common reason for hospital admissions and death among patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aymerich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aymerich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piquet-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piquet 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soler_x002d_Cataluna-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soler-Cataluna 2005</LINK>). In addition, patients with COPD have reported reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL) (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlenk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlenk 1998</LINK>) compared with the healthy population, which is further impaired by acute and repeated exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Seemungal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seemungal 1998</LINK>). Patients are at risk of early death and continued exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piquet-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piquet 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soler_x002d_Cataluna-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soler-Cataluna 2005</LINK>). Mortality rates during the year following a hospitalisation are around 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Almagro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almagro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groenewegen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groenewegen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seneff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seneff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vitacca-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitacca 2001</LINK>), and rehospitalisation rates are around 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cydulka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cydulka 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escarrabill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escarrabill 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groenewegen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groenewegen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>).</P>

Acute exacerbations are the cost drivers for COPD care, accounting for more than 70% of COPD-related costs incurred as the result of emergency visits and hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oostenbrink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostenbrink 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2000</LINK>). </P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-05 11:21:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Position papers of the American College of Physicians, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have provided recommendations on acute care and follow-up management for acute exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Amir-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amir 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Pulmonary rehabilitation could play an important role in peri-exacerbation management (management around the time of an exacerbation) because it combines several interventions that are known to improve health status and prognosis, such as physical exercise, smoking cessation, self-management education, optimisation of medications and psychological and social support (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maddocks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddocks 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2014</LINK>). A large body of evidence on patients with stable COPD shows that pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and HRQL (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>), and that it may be cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Any inpatient and/or outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme, including at least physical exercise (endurance or strength exercise, or both), delivered to patients who have received acute care for an exacerbation of COPD. The rehabilitation programme must commence immediately after initiation of exacerbation treatment or within three weeks of initiation of exacerbation treatment. We did not apply a criterion for the minimum number of exercise sessions to be included in the review because guideline recommendations provide no definition for when a programme qualifies as rehabilitation based on the number or type of exercise sessions. Rehabilitation programmes could include additional components such as self-management education, psychological support, dietary advice and breathing exercises. We excluded from the review studies on pulmonary rehabilitation programmes that included only neuromuscular stimulation or inspiratory muscle training but no physical exercise programme.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:01:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We used forest plots to compare results across trials and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to measure heterogeneity among them. When we identified substantial heterogeneity, we reported this and explored possible causes by performing prespecified subgroup analyses (extent of rehabilitation programme, length of follow-up (&lt; 3 months vs &#8805; 3 months)) and by analysing methodological items derived from the quality assessment (generation of random sequence, concealment of random allocation and blinding (low risk vs unclear or high risk). Previous versions of this review used length of follow-up and methodological items (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>). Compared with earlier versions of this review, investigators created extent of rehabilitation programmes as a new explanatory variable for heterogeneity (see below) on the basis of recent discussions (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkinson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkinson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maddocks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddocks 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2014</LINK>) and before meta-analyses were carried out.</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes can differ in many aspects, which may influence their effectiveness. Such programmes take place in inpatient, outpatient or home-based settings; are of short (e.g. six weeks) or long (e.g. six months) duration and involve different intensity (e.g. training twice per week, daily training). Exercise training can include both endurance and strength training or either of the two. and many types of exercise training can be chosen to match the needs of patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes also differ in terms of patient education offered, from basic advice to extensive self-management programmes. Finally, adherence to a pulmonary rehabilitation programme determines the amount of training and education actually received by participants (e.g. attendance at 60% of planned exercise sessions).</P>
<P>Given the increasing diversity of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and various ways to implement them in real-world practice, we introduced a new reason to explain heterogeneity as part of the update of this systematic review. We assessed how extensive rehabilitation programmes were as a possible source of heterogeneity of trial results, and we stratified meta-analyses by studies that offered an extensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme and studies that offered only moderately, slightly or not extensive pulmonary rehabilitation programmes (summarised as "less extensive" rehabilitation programmes). Review authors developed and used an approach not used before for assessment of the extent of rehabilitation programmes. When possible, we followed the statements and guidelines of national (British Thoracic Society; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>) and international societies (ERS and American Thoracic Society (ATS); <LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>). We did not upgrade or downgrade the extent of rehabilitation programmes if programme characteristics were in line with these statements and guidelines, but we downgraded or upgraded, respectively, the extent of programmes if some components were less than or exceeded what these guidance documents recommend. We considered pulmonary rehabilitation programmes to be extensive if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>participants followed, on average, at least 16 exercise training sessions, calculated as the total number of possible exercise training sessions times the (average) attendance rate. For example, if a programme was designed to include at least five exercise training sessions in the hospital, followed by a standard eight-week outpatient programme with three sessions per week, 5 + 24 = 29 sessions were possible. If the attendance rate was 80%, participants followed, on average, 23 exercise training sessions. We selected a cut-off of 16 exercise sessions based on duration of outpatient programmes of at least eight weeks, with two to three sessions per week and an attendance rate of 80% (thus 8*2.5 - 4 = 16 sessions), as recommended by ERS and ATS (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>), rather than on the lower minimum number of sessions (&#8805; 12) recommended by BTS (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>they included two to three exercise training sessions per week, as recommended by ERS, ATS and BTS (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>exercise training included at least endurance exercise (± strength exercise), as recommended by ERS, ATS and BTS (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>); or</LI>
<LI>most exercise training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists or other trained health professionals, as recommended by ERS, ATS and BTS (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Similar to the GRADE approach, we downgraded the extent of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes for the following reasons (e.g. by -1 from extensive to moderately extensive).</P>
<UL>
<LI>By -1 if the total number of exercise training sessions was between 10 and 15, and by -2 if the total number of exercise training sessions was less than 10.</LI>
<LI>By -1 if fewer than 2 training sessions were provided per week.</LI>
<LI>By -1 if training was offered that is unlikely to modify the risk for hospital admissions and mortality, and is unlikely to improve health-related quality of life and exercise capacity (e.g. only outdoor walking without the use of tests or parameters that would ensure training of at least moderate intensity, only strength exercise, less than 20 minutes of endurance training per session, other reasons).</LI>
<LI>By -1 if most exercise training sessions were not supervised by physiotherapists or other trained health professionals, and by -2 if most exercise training sessions (&gt; 80%) were not supervised at all.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We upgraded the extent of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes for the following reasons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>By +1 if the total number of exercise training sessions was greater than 30.</LI>
<LI>By +1 if pulmonary rehabilitation programmes included an extensive self-management programme (i.e. patient education about COPD, self-monitoring, early action when exacerbations develop, written action plan, etc.).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two review authors (EGS and MP) independently graded the pulmonary rehabilitation programmes of all included trials and resolved discrepancies in grading by discussion. If discrepancies remained, a third review author made the final decision.</P>
<P>Finally, we assessed how results changed with the addition of new studies and stratified analyses by studies included in the earlier version of this review versus studies added in this update.</P>

<P>High-quality evidence indicates that pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation improves health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The eight studies that used the SGRQ reported a statistically significant effect on total score, which was above the MID of four points (mean difference (MD) -7.80, 95% CI -12.12 to -3.47; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). Statistically significant and important effects (greater than MID) were also observed for the impact and activities domains of the SGRQ and for the dyspnoea, fatigue and emotional function domains of the CRQ (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Effects were not statistically significant for SGRQ symptoms nor for CRQ mastery domains. Again, heterogeneity was evident in all of these analyses, but most studies showed positive effects of pulmonary rehabilitation, with some studies observing large effects and others smaller but statistically significant effects. Extensive rehabilitation programmes showed larger effects than less extensive rehabilitation programmes, but differences between subgroups of trials (extensive vs less extensive programmes) were not statistically significant for CRQ (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>) nor for SGRQ (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>). Subgroup analyses comparing trials with respect to length of follow-up were inconsistent.

<P>High-quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) shows that six-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved, on average, by 62 meters (95% CI 38 to 86; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>) and shuttle walk test distance by 48 meters (95% CI -1 to 97; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>); these findings were not statistically significant. Again, much heterogeneity was evident, but most studies showed positive effects of pulmonary rehabilitation, and heterogeneity was driven particularly by differences between studies showing very large effects and studies showing smaller but statistically significant effects. Subgroup analysis comparing trials at low and high risk for bias with respect to concealment of random allocation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>) showed statistically significantly smaller effects in trials at low risk of bias. Studies at high risk of bias, because they lacked blinding, showed statistically significantly larger effects on the shuttle walk test (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>), but no other subgroup analyses revealed a reason for heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK> for 6MWD; <LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.35" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.35</LINK> for shuttle walk test).

<P>Overall evidence of high quality shows moderate to large effects of rehabilitation on health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are well above the minimal important difference (MID) for the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the six-minute walk distance test (6MWD) and the shuttle walk distance test (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2014</LINK>). Some recent studies showed no significant effect of rehabilitation on hospital readmissions and mortality. and introduced heterogeneity as compared with the last update of this review. Such heterogeneity of effects on hospital readmissions and mortality is not fully understood at this point, which explains why review authors assigned only moderate quality to evidence showing statistically significant effects of rehabilitation on hospital readmissions, and low quality to evidence revealing its not statistically significant effect on mortality.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:01:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The update of this systematic review was substantial in that review authors included 11 additional studies, and this more than doubled the number of included study participants. Updated meta-analyses that include a diverse set of trials informed the recent debate about how pulmonary rehabilitation has to be delivered to be beneficial for patients after acute exacerbations of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Maddocks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddocks 2015</LINK>). This debate began because more recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greening-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ko-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ko 2011</LINK>) showed smaller or no effects of pulmonary rehabilitation after acute exacerbations of COPD compared with earlier versions of this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>). As we argued earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>), small trials tend to overestimate the effect of an intervention compared with large trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cappelleri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappelleri 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LeLorier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeLorier 1997</LINK>). This phenomenon may be attributed in part to a publication bias, that is, the fact that small trials are more likely to be published if they show statistically significant treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>). On the other hand, methodological shortcomings of small trials such as inadequate generation of the randomisation code, insufficient concealment of random allocation and lack of blinding may contribute to discrepancies between the results of single large trials and pooled estimates based on small trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). In our systematic review, included trials had methodological limitations, and some subgroup analyses revealed that risk of bias explains some of the heterogeneity noted for different outcomes. Hence, it cannot be excluded that estimates provided by the meta-analyses may represent overestimations of the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation after an acute exacerbation.</P>
<P>Indeed, the largest trial, which included 320 participants, showed no benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Greening-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 2014</LINK>). However, this trial has been criticized for not offering an extensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkinson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkinson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2014</LINK>). Participants in the intervention group followed, on average, 2.6 supervised sessions during hospital admission, then received largely unsupervised training after discharge. Some may argue that we should not have included this trial in this systematic review because the intervention was not designed or implemented as a rehabilitation programme that is extensive enough to have an effect on hospital readmissions, mortality and other outcomes. It is difficult to draw a line to show when a programme qualifies as a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in accordance with international standards (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>), so we decided to use rather inclusive trial eligibility criteria. Such an approach offers the opportunity to explore reasons for heterogeneity across trials, which may be highly informative for practice. For this purpose, we applied a scoring approach to assess the extensiveness of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme (using addition and subtraction of points in a way that is similar to the GRADE approach). When developing this approach, we recognised that multiple criteria should be used rather than a single criterion, such as the number of completed training sessions or the combination of endurance and strength exercise. A single criterion is not sufficient for evaluation of complex interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation, wherein multiple components act synergistically and introduce the risk of mis-classifying studies. Therefore, we considered the number of exercise training sessions, the frequency of exercise training and type and supervision of training, as well as self-management education, in assessing how extensive pulmonary rehabilitation programmes were (<LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>). As much as possible, we aligned the cut-offs for upgrading and downgrading the extensiveness of rehabilitation programmes with the recent European Respiratory Society (ERS)-American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines on pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2013</LINK>). Although two independent review authors assessed programmes and sought consensus, we cannot exclude that others may classify some programmes differently. However, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> presents all reasons for downgrading or upgrading of evidence for each study.</P>
<P>Results of this systematic review suggest that it may matter how pulmonary rehabilitation is delivered. The eight trials that offered and implemented an extensive programme showed mostly large and consistent effects on readmissions, health-related quality of life and exercise capacity while also suggesting an effect on mortality. Although the programmes of these eight trials differed (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), all offered many training sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Behnke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Behnke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nava-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nava 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Troosters-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Troosters 2002</LINK>) or programmes long in duration (<LINK REF="STD-Behnke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Behnke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Troosters-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Troosters 2002</LINK>), or they added extensive self-management education to the exercise programme (<LINK REF="STD-Ko-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Ko 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Man-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Man 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2010</LINK>). The results of less extensive programmes are also important because some reflect barriers for implementation and uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation after acute exacerbations of COPD. For example, today's hospital admission for a COPD exacerbation is often too short in duration to permit initiation of a programme. Also, patients who are admitted are often old and have multiple conditions, which may render the uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation difficult. The transition from the inpatient to the outpatient setting and the organisation required along the continuum of care are challenging, and patients may not continue with rehabilitation or may not start at all. In some countries, reimbursement schemes do not allow for extensive rehabilitation programmes. All of these challenges have been recently summarised and discussed (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The applicability of current evidence also requires consideration that the group of patients willing or motivated by their healthcare professionals to participate in rehabilitation is probably quite a select one. This does not preclude that patients with COPD in general would benefit from rehabilitation after an exacerbation, but one should be cautious in judging the applicability of the results of this systematic review and should consider local circumstances and barriers. Conducting trials on pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation is challenging. First, recruitment of participants is difficult because many may not wish to be randomly allocated to different types of post exacerbation management in a situation of poor health status (<LINK REF="STD-Benzo-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Benzo 2015</LINK>). One trial on pulmonary rehabilitation after an exacerbation was stopped because only a few participants could be recruited (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2015</LINK>). Recruitment was very slow in one trial comparing rehabilitation after exacerbation with rehabilitation in a stable pulmonary state (<LINK REF="STD-Puhan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Puhan 2012</LINK>), and another trial had to be stopped before the recruitment target was reached (<LINK REF="REF-Spaar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spaar 2009</LINK>). Second, individuals willing to participate in a trial are likely to have a preference for pulmonary rehabilitation. If they are randomised to the control group or to rehabilitation after a period of time, they might ask for pulmonary rehabilitation at any time during follow-up. Given the clear benefits of this intervention for patients in a stable condition as confirmed in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>), patients who experience an exacerbation can hardly be refused access to rehabilitative strategies. Whatever design investigators choose, a careful discussion of ethical and methodological issues is necessary before large trials are under way.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence was moderate for hospital readmissions, low for mortality and high for health-related quality of life and exercise capacity. The main reason for downgrading the quality of evidence for hospital readmissions and mortality is the heterogeneity of results, with some trials showing positive effects of rehabilitation, some no effects and one even revealing a negative impact of rehabilitation on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Greening-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 2014</LINK>). In addition, none of the trials included mortality as a primary outcome, and most reported durations of follow-up that were too short for an effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on mortality to be detected.

<P>Compared with pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD in stable condition, the effect size of rehabilitation on health-related quality of life is similar among patients who have recently had an exacerbation of COPD. Mean differences between rehabilitation and control groups for CRQ dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery domains in this Cochrane review were close to those observed in the Cochrane review on pulmonary rehabilitation for people with stable COPD (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>). Compared with the earlier version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>), the current evidence base is more diverse because different pulmonary rehabilitation programmes have been tested across a wide range of participants and settings around the world.

Together with large improvements in exercise capacity and, in particular, substantial risk reduction for hospital admissions, pulmonary rehabilitation appears to be a particularly attractive addition to the treatment of patients after an exacerbation if an extensive rehabilitation programme can be implemented. Several possible explanations have been proposed for these large effects. First, as mentioned above, exacerbations lead to significant reductions in muscle function (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2003</LINK>) and physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Pitta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitta 2006</LINK>). This initial deterioration may render patients more likely to improve following pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a particularly potent intervention for reverting physical inactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Troosters-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troosters 2010a</LINK>), and it has been shown that patients whose physical activity levels improve have less chance of being readmitted (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aymerich-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aymerich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pitta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitta 2006</LINK>). Second, because eligible participants had been hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation, a deficiency in self-management or education may be evident among this group. This deficiency may be targeted in part by the rehabilitation intervention, and patient education may be of particular benefit for modifying behaviour in these patients. Indeed, a major study of a patient management programme that included home exercise for patients with COPD after an acute exacerbation reported impressive results (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>). In this study, the mean number of hospital admissions per participant was reduced from 1.6 to 0.9 during the year following hospital admission for an acute exacerbation. It is well known from earlier studies that the recovery period is long, even for patients who have no further exacerbations, and that another exacerbation within six months can markedly limit recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2003</LINK>). A final explanation for the attractiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes may be the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on depressive symptoms after exacerbations. Depression is a significant risk factor for readmission, and pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve depressive symptoms among depressed patients (<LINK REF="REF-Coventry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coventry 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trappenburg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trappenburg 2005</LINK>). Our meta-analyses show that pulmonary rehabilitation during the recovery period is superior to usual care in terms of prognosis and health-related quality of life.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Do we need more trials on pulmonary rehabilitation after COPD exacerbations?</HEADING>
<P>A large body of available evidence from the systematic review on stable patients with COPD and from this systematic review shows large effects of pulmonary rehabilitation among patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>). Recently available trial findings show that many different exercise protocols are feasible and effective for patients with COPD, even if patients have poor health status, as is often the case during and after rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>). Exercise modalities include various forms of endurance and strength training, specific resistance training during hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Troosters-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troosters 2010a</LINK>), neuromuscular electrical stimulation and interval training, among others (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-ATS-Statement-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS ATS Statement 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sillen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Questions now may be focused less on the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation after a COPD exacerbation in principle and more on how rehabilitation programmes should be designed and implemented, and how practitioners can foster patient uptake (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-ERS-Policy-statement-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS ERS Policy statement 2015</LINK>). Uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation by patients is often low. In the Eaton trial, for example, 97 of 288 participants agreed to enrol in the trial; 47 were randomised to pulmonary rehabilitation, but only 19 of these 47 participants adhered to the rehabilitation programme (<LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2009</LINK>). Those who adhered to the programme had substantially lower risk of readmission than participants who did not adhere to the rehabilitation programme, which corroborates the results of this Cochrane review showing that extensive rehabilitation programmes may be effective. Researchers should explore new ways of motivating patients to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation. For example, practitioners can explore the preferences of patients in terms of setting and type of exercise training, so the programme can be individualised according to both medical criteria and patient preferences. Also, the best timing for rehabilitation remains uncertain. Should rehabilitation start during an admission or shortly thereafter, or should it start when a patient's condition is stable again? An advantage of immediate rehabilitation after exacerbation is that it may provide a window of opportunity for patient education because patients may be more willing to change their health behaviour after an exacerbation. Also, continuity of care is possible if patients are immediately referred to pulmonary rehabilitation. A disadvantage of rehabilitation after exacerbation is that patients often re-exacerbate within weeks, so that the rehabilitation process is interrupted or even discontinued. Also, initiation of physical exercise is challenging for patients after an exacerbation, and more time may be needed to find the appropriate exercise protocol for an individual patient (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2005a</LINK>). One trial addressed the comparison of early versus late rehabilitation after an exacerbation but failed to recruit enough participants (<LINK REF="STD-Puhan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Puhan 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies included in this Cochrane review had a median follow-up of three months. Given that physical exercise and self-management should be based on a long-term perspective, it is important for researchers to gather more data on health outcomes and costs over longer periods. Large and long-term randomised trials would be ideal for addressing these important questions, but they may not be feasible because of lack of funding, slow participant recruitment and other reasons, as explained above. Therefore, advanced observational study methods and analyses may be employed. Finally, more evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation in the post exacerbation setting is needed to inform policy decisions about pulmonary rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Evidence of moderate quality (on average) from 20 studies (1477 participants) suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective intervention for post exacerbation treatment of patients with COPD. Effects leading to improved health-related quality of life and exercise capacity are large. Effects on hospital readmission were statistically significant in the meta-analysis but heterogenous across trials, and investigators need to explore whether the extensiveness of rehabilitation programmes explains such heterogeneity.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-05 11:26:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The decision to begin new trials of pulmonary rehabilitation should be made against the background of perceived ethics about the benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbation and against the methodological and logistical challenges of such trials if comparisons include a no-exercise intervention. Studies should investigate how care providers can design and implement extensive rehabilitation programmes with a long-term perspective that are feasible, reimbursable and attractive enough for patients and healthcare providers. Trials should assess the best timing of pulmonary rehabilitation. Finally, formal cost-effectiveness analyses should be conducted to estimate the financial benefit derived from rehabilitation after COPD exacerbations.</P>

<P>Review authors added risk of bias tables for the 2010 update of this review. We added a 'Summary of findings' table, along with specified subgroup analyses on extensiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, length of follow-up and three indicators of methodological quality.</P>
<P>We added clarification regarding types of studies: We did not include studies on pulmonary rehabilitation programmes that included only neuromuscular stimulation or inspiratory muscle training but no physical exercise programme.</P>
<P>In the original protocol, we planned to attempt to obtain data from intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations, and to perform a sensitivity analysis to see whether this made a difference in meta-analysis results; however, the number of trials and the quality of their reporting did not allow us to compare ITT and per-protocol analyses.</P>

<P>Thanks for a very helpful review. I am interested in using for my patients, but am puzzled by which program of "rehabilitation" to adopt. The table of characteristics shows considerable variation, with several combinations, although most seem to be endurance exercise only rather than a more complex "rehabilitation" program. I was interested in any advice on what program I should implement with my patients. Could this (and a sample program) be included with the updated review?</P>

<P>Thank you for this comment. Based on our review, we cannot make any statements about which rehabilitation programmes work best. However, there are systematic reviews on trials comparing different exercise programs that may help you defining your rehabilitation programme (e.g. Puhan et al. Comparison of exercise modalities and intensities to treat skeletal muscle dysfunction during respiratory rehabilitation in COPD patients - a systematic review. Thorax 2005;60(5):367-75).</P>

<P>We performed literature searches in the following electronic databases:<BR/>MEDLINE<BR/>Embase<BR/>PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database)<BR/>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2008, Issue 2)</P>
<P>We performed a very broad literature search to identify any randomised controlled studies on pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD. The search strategy for MEDLINE and Embase can be found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. In addition, we used the PubMed "related articles" function for included studies to identify further studies. Also, we performed a Science Citation Index search for studies that cite included studies, as well as for studies that are cited by included studies.</P>
<P>In addition, we carried out a search of the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register of COPD trials, using the following terms:</P>
<P>(rehabilitat* or fitness or exercis* or physical* or train* or kinesio* or endurance*) and (acute* or exacerb* or emerg* or hospital* or admit* or admis* or discharg*)</P>
