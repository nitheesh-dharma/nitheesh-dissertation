<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Surgical operations are undertaken within a clean environment and with members of the surgical team wearing sterile gloves. Sterile surgical gloves aim to protect the patient from contamination with bacteria from members of the surgical team and protect the surgical team from the body fluids of the patient. Double-gloving (wearing two sets of gloves) is becoming more common, especially for surgery where sharp surfaces are formed (such as orthopaedic or dental surgery). The review found that a second pair of gloves does protect the inner pair, without apparently affecting surgical performance. A glove liner between the two pairs of gloves reduces breaks to the inner glove even further, and extra-thick gloves seem to be as good as two pairs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The invasive nature of surgery, with its increased exposure to blood, means that during surgery there is a high risk of transfer of pathogens. Pathogens can be transferred through contact between surgical patients and the surgical team, resulting in post-operative or blood borne infections in patients or blood borne infections in the surgical team. Both patients and the surgical team need to be protected from this risk. This risk can be reduced by implementing protective barriers such as wearing surgical gloves. Wearing two pairs of surgical gloves, triple gloves, glove liners or cloth outer gloves, as opposed to one pair, is considered to provide an additional barrier and further reduce the risk of contamination. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine if additional glove protection reduces the number of surgical site or blood borne infections in patients or the surgical team. The secondary objective was to determine if additional glove protection reduces the number of perforations to the innermost pair of surgical gloves. The innermost gloves (next to skin) compared with the outermost gloves are considered to be the last barrier between the patient and the surgical team.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-07 09:27:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials were found which addressed the primary outcome, namely, surgical site infections in patients. Both trials reported no infections.</P>
<P>Thirty one randomised controlled trials measuring glove perforations were identified and included in the review. </P>
<P>Fourteen trials of double gloving (wearing two pairs of surgical latex gloves) were pooled and showed that there were significantly more perforations to the single glove than the innermost of the double gloves (OR 4.10, 95% CI 3.30 to 5.09).</P>
<P>Eight trials of indicator gloves (coloured latex gloves worn underneath latex gloves to more rapidly alert the team to perforations) showed that significantly fewer perforations were detected with single gloves compared with indicator gloves (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16) or with standard double glove compared with indicator gloves (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17).</P>
<P>Two trials of glove liners (a glove knitted with cloth or polymers worn between two pairs of latex gloves)(OR 26.36, 95% CI 7.91 to 87.82), three trials of knitted gloves (knitted glove worn on top of latex surgical gloves)(OR 5.76, 95% CI 3.25 to 10.20) and one trial of triple gloving (three pairs of latex surgical gloves)(OR 69.41, 95% CI 3.89 to 1239.18) all compared with standard double gloves, showed there were significantly more perforations to the innermost glove of a standard double glove in all comparisons.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no direct evidence that additional glove protection worn by the surgical team reduces surgical site infections in patients, however the review has insufficient power for this outcome.</P>
<P>The addition of a second pair of surgical gloves significantly reduces perforations to innermost gloves. Triple gloving, knitted outer gloves and glove liners also significantly reduce perforations to the innermost glove. Perforation indicator systems results in significantly more innermost glove perforations being detected during surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-28 16:26:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The invasive nature of surgery means that during surgery there is a high risk of transfer of pathogens. Pathogens can be transferred from the surgical team to their patients and from patients to their surgical teams. This transfer may occur through a number of routes including contact with skin or blood. For the patient, this transfer of pathogens can result in a surgical wound infection which may compromise the success of their surgery, prolong their hospital stay or may become life threatening. A national audit of 149,745 surgical patients in England from 1997 to 2003 found a total of 5,457 surgical site infections (<LINK REF="REF-SSISS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SSISS 2004</LINK>).The surgical team are also at risk with surgeons, for example, having three times the incidence rate of Hepatitis B compared with the general public (<LINK REF="REF-Rabussay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabussay 1997</LINK>). In an attempt to prevent contamination from hand contact during surgery the surgical team wear sterile gloves (<LINK REF="REF-Jagger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panlilo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panlilo 1991</LINK>). However, gloves can become perforated and their protective function is then compromised. Perforations usually occur as a result of injuries from sharps, such as sutures, instruments, bone fragments and also through natural wear and tear.</P>
<P>A number of products are available which are meant to offer additional protection to single gloving. These include double gloving (wearing two pairs of surgical latex gloves), perforation indicator systems, glove liners and cloth outer gloves (<LINK REF="STD-Kovavisarach-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kovavisarach 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Underwood-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Underwood 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The decision to use additional glove protection is influenced by a variety of factors such as the surgical procedure involved, prior knowledge of the 'risk' status of the surgical patient, abrasions on the hands of the surgical team and personal preference. For example, orthopaedic surgery is considered to have a high risk of glove perforation due to the nature of the surgery which usually involves sawing, drilling and contact with sharp objects such as bone. Therefore the practice of double gloving is more common among the orthopaedic surgical team. The risk status of a surgical patient is also influential; if a patient is known or considered to be a high risk for pathogens then double gloving is one of the precautionary practices instituted.</P>
<P>Gloving practice varies between different countries and different surgical specialities. In the UK, Europe and the USA single gloving appears to be standard practice in all specialities except for orthopaedics and maxillofacial surgery where double gloving is employed. Glove liners and cloth outer gloves are rare in the UK and Europe. In the USA, most orthopaedic surgeons wear additional protection, which also includes triple gloving, glove liners and cloth outer gloves. Other surgical specialities in the USA do not routinely double glove (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-St-Germaine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">St Germaine 2003</LINK>). Some surgeons have resisted double gloving, citing a reduction in dexterity and sensation (<LINK REF="STD-Matta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Matta 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-St-Germaine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">St Germaine 2003</LINK>). However, the use of double gloving for specialities outside of orthopaedics is increasing (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following the publication of the original Cochrane review of double gloving (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 2002</LINK>), a number of professional organisations have issued guidelines or statements supporting or incorporating the Cochrane recommendations for practice. These include The Royal College of Surgeons of England (<LINK REF="REF-Rainsworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rainsworth 2005</LINK>), The National Association of Theatre Nurses (<LINK REF="REF-NATN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NATN 2005</LINK>), The Association of PeriOperative Nurses (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2005</LINK>) and the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses (<LINK REF="REF-ACORN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACORN 2004</LINK>). This review is an update of the previous review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Single latex gloves compared with double latex gloves</HEADING>
<P>This category compares single gloving with double gloving. It includes two types of single gloves; standard gloves (standard thickness) and orthopaedic gloves (thicker than standard). Two double gloving products are also included in this category; standard double gloving and perforation indicator systems. Standard double gloving is the practice of wearing one pair of standard latex surgical gloves on top of another. A perforation indicator system is a system intended to enable the glove wearer to detect perforations to their gloves more easily. It involves wearing a standard latex glove on top of a coloured (usually green) standard latex glove. In the event of a perforation to the outermost glove, moisture from the operating site seeps into the layer between the two pairs of gloves. The moisture then becomes highly visible as a bright green spot.</P>
<P>In double gloving, the gloves worn next to the skin are known as the innermost gloves and the gloves worn on top are the outermost gloves. In this category the number of perforations is compared in (a) the single glove compared with the innermost glove and (b) the single glove compared with the outermost glove. Overall data is presented first followed by data for each of the four subgroups contributing to this comparison. In (c) the number of perforations detected by the glove wearer during surgery as a proportion of the total number of perforations are compared in single gloves and indicator gloves.</P>

The data from Laine 2004 were not sufficiently clear to be included in the meta-analysis. The Duron 1996 study was carried out in low risk general surgery and Nicolai 1997 in high risk orthopaedic surgery, however both trials show similar results. The gloves used in both studies are similar and though <LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 1997</LINK> stated that sealed envelopes were used neither trial provided sufficient detail of the randomisation or the blinding of the glove testers. Due to their similarity, these two trials representing a total of 396 gloves were pooled in a meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used due to possible heterogeneity resulting from different types of surgery. There is no statistically significant difference in the number of perforations to innermost gloves when wearing double gloves or double indicator gloves (10% versus 7.5% of inner gloves respectively) (OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.90)(<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>This category compared the number of perforations detected by glove wearers during surgery as a proportion of the total number of perforations.

The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 1997</LINK>) found that out of 16 actual perforations in the innermost indicator glove, 3 were detected compared with 0 out of 16 actual perforations in the inner double glove group.

<P>A random effects model was used in recognition that there were differences in the type of surgery.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Although the primary aim of wearing additional glove barriers during surgery is to provide extra protection against infections no trials set out to measure the relationship between gloves and infections in patients or staff. The aim of all 31 trials included in this review was to determine glove perforations. Two small trials did report that no infections had been found in their patients, but it is not possible to draw any conclusions from this as no information was given regarding the measurement of this outcome. While there is evidence of transferred pathogens between the surgical team and patients (<LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harpez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harpez 1996</LINK>) there are no studies which show a direct link between glove perforations and transferred pathogens. It is assumed that glove perforations allow the transfer of infections and therefore increase the risk of infection. Very large RCTs of infection rates when wearing different gloving methods would be necessary to identify the real impact of wearing additional glove protection and the unit of randomisation should be the surgeon or surgical team.<BR/>
<BR/>Double gloving with either two pairs of standard latex gloves or a perforation indicator system is significantly more effective than single gloving in reducing glove perforations. In a meta-analysis of just under 9,000 gloves (Analysis 01), perforations in single gloves were reduced from 9% to 2% for double innermost gloves. It is interesting to note that all of the studies included in this comparison were conducted in specialities which are considered to be low risk for perforation, this means specialities which did not include drilling, sawing or wiring. One of the subgroups in the single versus double gloving analysis involved single orthopaedic gloves. Though overall double gloving is more effective than single gloving, single orthopaedic gloves appear to offer the same level of protection as double gloving. The glove wearer also had fewer perforations in the orthopaedic glove than the double outermost glove which suggests that a single pair of orthopaedic gloves may not be as cumbersome.</P>
<P>There has been some resistance to double gloving by surgeons who feel their dexterity is compromised (<LINK REF="REF-St-Germaine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">St Germaine 2003</LINK>). However double gloving did not result in significantly more outer glove perforations than single gloves, suggesting that the dexterity of the glove wearer is not sufficiently compromised leading to additional perforations.</P>
<P>Perforation indicator systems are effective in enabling glove wearers to detect perforations more easily. Two meta-analyses, one comparing single gloves with a perforations indicator system (582 gloves) and one comparing double gloves with a perforation indicator system (417 gloves) both showed that glove wearers detected significantly more perforations when using a perforation indicator system.</P>
<P>Almost all of the additional glove measures evaluated in this review - glove liners, knitted cloth gloves and triple gloving all provide significantly more protection than standard double gloving. The only exception is steel weave gloves which appeared to provide the same level of protection, with respect to the number of perforations, as standard double gloving.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison with other reviews</HEADING>
<P>This review updates the previous Cochrane review published in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 2002</LINK>). One trial which was under assessment has been included (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1996</LINK>) and an additional 13 trials have been added giving a total of 31 included trials. Despite the large amount of new data the findings for each of the comparisons are similar. This review presents the same findings and conclusions as the previous review. The only new comparison is triple gloving.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-one eligible RCTs were included in this review. The methodological quality and reporting of methods of most of these trials was poor. Three trials were identified as being high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnquest-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Turnquest 1996</LINK>). Around half of the trials did not provide sufficient details of their process of randomisation or allocation to allow us to judge their validity. Only 5 out of 31 trials described sufficient randomisation and seven trials used inadequate methods of randomisation - patient number, admission date and patient birth dates. Just over half the trials randomised the glove wearer with the remaining trials randomising the patient. Only four trials stated that the testers were unaware of the allocation status of the gloves and only two trials carried out sample size calculations during the study design.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Sample sizes were either given as the number of gloves tested or the number of operations included in the study. In some studies the number of gloves tested was confusing as authors did not specify if the figures represented individual gloves, pairs of gloves - or in the case of double gloving, sets of gloves (that is, four individual gloves). Judging the size of the sample was difficult due to the following variables - number of staff scrubbed for each operation and number of gloves worn by each person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>The confidence with which we can draw firm conclusions from these trials is influenced by weaknesses in their methods of testing for perforations. The standard perforation test recognised by the American Society for Testing and Materials and the European Standards Committee was used in only nine trials. However, there is some consistency among the remaining trials in that most used similar amounts of water, allowing comparisons to be made. Only three trials, all with the same author and conducted in Thailand, tested for perforations by filling the gloves with air and then submerging them in water.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Surgical specialities</HEADING>
<P>It was intended in the protocol to group trials by surgical speciality. However, it transpired that the trials had already separated themselves by surgical speciality and method of intervention. For example, trials involving the highest levels of protection (double and triple gloving options) were exclusively conducted in orthopaedic and maxillofacial surgery. This conforms with the current perception of specialities as being low or high risk for perforations. For example, double gloving is routine practice in orthopaedic surgery and rare in general surgery. However, rather than labelling entire surgical specialities as high or low risk it might be more appropriate to identify the risk for individual procedures. It might appear that the risk of glove perforation increases with procedures which involve bone and metal work, deep cavities or confined spaces.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>Almost all of the trials included in this review were limited in some way. Reporting of the trial design was usually poor in that most authors did not provide details of the randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding. Though the testing methods were comparable, future trials should use the standard test for measuring glove perforations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We addressed attempts to overcome potential publication bias in the search strategy. One article was found which required translation. We contacted manufacturers and professional organisations for information. None of the companies and organisations which replied provided information which had not already been identified. We contacted nine trial authors for further information. Seven responded and all these trials are included in the review.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-22 18:43:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to determine the effect of wearing additional gloves on transferred infections. </P>
<P>Wearing two pairs of latex surgical gloves is associated with significantly fewer inner glove perforations. This evidence comes from trials undertaken in 'low risk' surgical specialties (there were none in orthopaedic joint surgery for example). There does not appear to be an increase in the number of perforations to outermost gloves when two pairs of gloves are worn, suggesting that wearing two pairs of gloves does not reduce dexterity to the extent that the glove wearer sustains more perforations. Wearing one pair of orthopaedic gloves (thicker than standard latex) is as effective as wearing two pairs of standard latex gloves in reducing the number of perforations to innermost gloves. Wearing glove perforation indicator systems enables the glove wearer to detect perforations to gloves more easily than when wearing standard double latex gloves. Wearing a perforation indicator system does not affect the number of perforations sustained. </P>
<P>Wearing a glove liner between two pairs of latex surgical gloves when undertaking joint replacement surgery is not associated with more perforations to the outermost glove and significantly reduces the number of perforations to the innermost glove. Wearing knitted outer gloves when undertaking joint replacement surgery significantly reduces the number of perforations to the innermost glove. Wearing steel weave outer gloves when undertaking joint replacement surgery does not appear to reduce the number of perforations to innermost gloves. Triple gloving offers more protection than double gloving. </P>
<P>When choosing a method of glove protection, triple gloving, knitted outer gloves and glove liners offer more protection than standard latex double gloving, Standard double gloving and perforation indicator systems offer more protection than single gloving.</P>

<P>Studies to be considered for the review were sought from Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register. This database was searched on CD ROM 2002 Issue 1 using the following strategy:<BR/>1. GLOVES-SURGICAL*:ME<BR/>2. PROTECTIVE-CLOTHING*:ME<BR/>3. (GLOVE or GLOVES)<BR/>4. (GLOVE and LINER)<BR/>5. (PUNCTURE and INDICATOR*)<BR/>6. ((((#1 or #2) or #3) or #4) or #5)<BR/>7. OPERATING-ROOMS*ME<BR/>8. INFECTION-CONTROL*:ME<BR/>9. (#7 or #8)<BR/>10. (#6 and #9)<BR/>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register has been compiled through searching the major health databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE and is regularly updated through hand searching of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The American Journal of Infection Control (from 1990) was handsearched.</P>
<P>Reference lists of located trials and review articles were searched. Citation lists of obtained articles were scrutinised to identify additional studies. Details of published and unpublished studies were sought from the following glove manufacturing companies; SSL International, Regent Medical, Semper-med, Vernacare, BM Polyco Ltd, Ansell Medical, Safeskin and Allegiance. The language of publication of an article was not a barrier. The professional associations, National Association of Theatre Nurses (UK), European Operating Room Nurse Association, Association of Operating Room Nurses (USA), Infection Control Nurses Association (UK), Royal College of Surgeons (UK) and The British Association of Operating Department Assistants were approached for information. The conference proceedings of The National Association of Theatre Nurses were hand searched and an electronic search of the ZETOC database of conference proceedings was undertaken.</P>
<P>Of the glove manufacturers contacted, SSL International, Regent Medical and Allegiance Healthcare responded. Allegiance Healthcare provided the results of a literature search on double gloving. The National Association of Theatre Nurses gave details of a conference paper on double gloving. All of the trials identified by the glove manufacturers and professional associations were identified through the conventional search strategy.</P>

<P>For this first update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (January 2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>Issue 4, 2005), using the following strategy:</P>
<P>1. GLOVES-SURGICAL explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>2. PROTECTIVE-CLOTHING explode tree 1 (MeSH)<BR/>3. (glove or gloves or gloving)<BR/>4. (puncture and indicator*)<BR/>5. (#1 or #2 or #3 or #4)<BR/>6. SURGICAL WOUND INFECTION explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>7. WOUND INFECTION single term (MeSH)<BR/>8. INFECTION CONTROL explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>9. (wound* near infect*)<BR/>10. (surg* near infect*)<BR/>11. (surg* near wound*)<BR/>12. (surg* near complication*)<BR/>13. OPERATING ROOMS single term (MeSH)<BR/>14.

<P>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register has been compiled through searching the major health databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE and is regularly updated through hand searching of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).</P>
<P>We searched reference lists of located trials and review articles and scrutinised citation lists of obtained articles to identify additional studies. We also sought details of published and unpublished studies from the following glove manufacturing companies; Regent Medical, Semper-med, Vernacare, BM Polyco Ltd, Ansell Medical, Safeskin and Allegiance. We contacted the following professional associations: Association for Perioperative Practice (UK), European Operating Room Nurse Association, Association of Operating Room Nurses (USA), Infection Control Nurses Association (UK), Royal College of Surgeons (UK) and The British Association of Operating Department Assistants for information. In addition, we hand searched the conference proceedings of The Association for Perioperative Practice and undertook an electronic search of the ZETOC database of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Of the glove manufacturers contacted, Regent Medical and Allegiance Healthcare responded. Allegiance Healthcare provided the results of a literature search on double gloving. The Association for Perioperative Practice gave details of a conference paper on double gloving. All of the trials identified by the glove manufacturers and professional associations were identified through the conventional search strategy.</P>
<P>For the original version of this review, we hand searched The American Journal of Infection Control 1990 to 2000. As no additional trials were found we did not repeat this process for this updated version.</P>
