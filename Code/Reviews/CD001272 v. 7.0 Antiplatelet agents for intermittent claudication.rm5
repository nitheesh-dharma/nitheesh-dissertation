<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-04 13:20:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to the blocking of large arteries. Patients with peripheral arterial disease as a result of narrowing of the arteries in the legs may present with cramping pain in the legs or buttocks on walking; this is also known as intermittent claudication (IC). This group of patients are at high risk of a heart attack, stroke and death. Treatment often involves stopping cigarette smoking and the optimising of other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Another treatment often used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with IC is antiplatelet treatment. Antiplatelets make the blood less sticky and therefore block the formation of blood clots, thereby preventing blockages in arteries which can cause heart attacks and strokes. Antiplatelet treatments include drugs such as aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole, but there is limited evidence to date on the benefits of antiplatelet therapy in patients with IC. Twelve studies with a total of 12,168 patients were included in this review. The analyses show that, in patients with IC, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of death from all causes, and from heart attack and stroke combined when compared with placebo. When aspirin was compared with other antiplatelet agents, there was some evidence that the alternative antiplatelet had a more beneficial effect in reducing all cause mortality or of suffering a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke. However, this was based on only two trials. Antiplatelet usage, however, does increase the risk of indigestion and may also increase risk of major bleeding events. Despite its widespread use, the evidence for first line use of aspirin in patients with IC is weak and further research is required to determine whether aspirin would be better replaced by a different class of antiplatelet agent which has a greater beneficial effect with fewer side-effects.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:17:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes including all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, adverse events, pain free walking distance, need for revascularisation, limb amputation and ankle brachial pressure indices were collected. For each outcome, the pooled risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-04 13:26:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 12 studies with a combined total of 12,168 patients were included in this review. Antiplatelet agents reduced all cause (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.93) in patients with IC compared with placebo. A reduction in total cardiovascular events was not statistically significant (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01). Data from two trials (which tested clopidogrel and picotamide respectively against aspirin) showed a significantly lower risk of all cause mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) with antiplatelets other than aspirin compared with aspirin. Antiplatelet therapy was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms (dyspepsia) (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.61) and adverse events leading to cessation of therapy (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.75) compared with placebo; data on major bleeding (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.51, 5.83) and on adverse events in trials of aspirin versus alternative antiplatelet were limited. Risk of limb deterioration leading to revascularisation was significantly reduced by antiplatelet treatment compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-04 12:16:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiplatelet agents have a beneficial effect in reducing all cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular events in patients with IC. Treatment with antiplatelet agents in this patient group however is associated with an increase in adverse effects, including GI symptoms, and healthcare professionals and patients need to be aware of the potential harm as well as the benefit of therapy; more data are required on the effect of antiplatelets on major bleeding. Evidence on the effectiveness of aspirin versus either placebo or an alternative antiplatelet agent is lacking. Evidence for thienopyridine antiplatelet agents was particularly compelling and there is an urgent need for multicentre trials to compare the effects of aspirin against thienopyridines.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 14:37:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb is common. In the Edinburgh Artery Study of men and women aged 55 to 74 years, 4.5% had symptomatic PAD. A further 8% had evidence of major asymptomatic disease and 16.6% had abnormal haemodynamic parameters suggesting minor PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of PAD increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvin 2004</LINK>) and is more common in men (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2008</LINK>). One of the commonest non-invasive methods of diagnosing PAD is the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI). An ABPI &lt; 0.9 is 95% sensitive and 100% specific for detecting angiogram positive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Norgren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgren 2007</LINK>). Peripheral arterial disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity. In its early stages, PAD may be asymptomatic. The most common symptom, intermittent claudication (IC), occurs in approximately 0.5 to 14% of the population depending on age, sex and geographical location (<LINK REF="REF-Balkau-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkau 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). People with IC experience pain in the calves, thighs or buttocks when they are walking and the pain subsides with rest. At the other extreme of the disease, PAD may manifest as rest pain, ulceration or gangrene.</P>
<P>Many patients with IC have relatively mild complaints, but up to 20% of patients will go on to require reconstructive surgery, and 1 to 2% will eventually undergo amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>). Patients with symptomatic IC can have reduced levels of mobility and quality of life which equate to that associated with some cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Belch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belch 2003</LINK>). Peripheral arterial disease is also a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, and is associated with both concomitant and subsequent coronary and cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Aronow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1993</LINK>). Compared with age-matched controls, patients with IC have a three to six-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1996</LINK>). In the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) multi-national registry of patients with known cardiovascular disease or increased cardiovascular risk, the highest cardiovascular event rate was in patients with PAD. At one year follow-up, 18.2% of PAD patients had suffered a cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, or had been hospitalised for a cardiovascular event compared with 13.3% of the coronary artery disease group and 10% of the cerebrovascular disease group (<LINK REF="REF-Steg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steg 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of patients with IC are treated conservatively, including smoking cessation and regular exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>) to improve the collateral blood vessels supplying the lower limbs. Smoking is a particularly important modifiable risk factor for PAD: smokers with PAD are more likely to progress to critical limb ischaemia and to require an amputation or vascular intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Jonason-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonason 1985</LINK>) and smoking cessation can reduce overall cardiovascular risk to the level of non-smokers within two to four years (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1990</LINK>). Diabetes mellitus is also an important risk factor for the development of PAD. People with diabetes have a 1.5 to 2.5 fold increased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic PAD compared with non-diabetics, and the life-time risk of a lower limb amputation is increased 10 to 16 times (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Delaimy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Delaimy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacGregor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacGregor 1999</LINK>). To date, antihypertensive agents (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>) and lipid-lowering therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Aung-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aung 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HPSCG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPSCG 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meade-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 2002</LINK>) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with PAD.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-02 08:05:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Platelets play a key role in haemostasis and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. Circulating platelets are quiescent and do not bind to the intact endothelium. However, endothelial damage following injury leads to exposure of circulating platelets to the subendothelial extracellular matrix and triggers platelet recruitment and adhesion (<LINK REF="REF-Varga_x002d_Szabo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varga-Szabo 2008</LINK>). Platelet adhesion occurs when the von Willebrand factor binds to various glycoprotein (GP) receptors (GP Ib-IX-V complex); receptors for collagen and fibronectin also participate in platelet adhesion. Adherent platelets secrete preformed adenosine diphosphate (ADP), fibrinogen, thromboxane A<SUB>2</SUB> (TXA<SUB>2</SUB>), and other chemotaxins; clotting factors; and vasoconstrictors from granules, which activate the platelets (<LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 2002b</LINK>). Activated platelets change their shape and secrete ADP and platelet-derived growth factor, fibrinogen and TXA<SUB>2</SUB>. Platelet aggregation involves recruitment of additional platelets and is mediated by the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. This forms a prothrombotic surface that promotes clot formation, contributing to the fibrous plaque development and the consequent thromboembolic complications. The latter can lead to myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral vascular occlusions (<LINK REF="REF-Davi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davi 2007</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest that PAD is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Blood viscosity, for example, is increased in with patients with claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Fagher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagher 1993</LINK>). Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, dipyridamole, picotamide, ticlodipine and clopidogrel act at specific sites of platelet activation and affect multiple pathways. Aspirin (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) interferes with the biosynthesis of TXA<SUB>2</SUB>, prostacyclin and other prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Awtry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awtry 2000</LINK>). Dipyridamole (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) is a platelet adhesion inhibitor that exerts its effects by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase and blocking the uptake of adenosine (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 2004</LINK>). Picotamide on the other hand interferes with arachidonic acid cascade of platelets by inhibiting TXA<SUB>2 </SUB>synthase and antagonising TXA<SUB>2 </SUB>receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Ratti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratti 1998</LINK>). Unlike aspirin, picotamide does not affect cyclo-oxygenase. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel (thienopyridines) interfere with ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation and cause an irreversible non-competitive inhibition of platelet function (<LINK REF="REF-Schror-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schror 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-04 12:16:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current use of antiplatelet treatment to reduce the risk of cerebrovascular and coronary events in high risk patients subgroups is based to a great extent on evidence inferred from a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials involving patients with coronary and cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). The benefit of antiplatelet agents specifically in patients with IC is unknown. In addition, use of antiplatelet agents can be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer and haemorrhage and other adverse events, such as blood dyscrasias (neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia). There is currently no clear evidence on the risk-benefit ratio of antiplatelet therapy in people with IC. Novel antiplatelet agents with potentially increased effectiveness and fewer side-effects compared with aspirin and other older antiplatelet agents are being developed (<LINK REF="REF-Ueno-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueno 2011</LINK>), however, there is a paucity of evidence comparing the effectiveness of one antiplatelet agent over another.     </P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-10-02 08:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of antiplatelet agents in reducing mortality (all cause and cardiovascular), and cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) in patients with stable intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage II) (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the efficacy of antiplatelet agents in reducing the need for revascularisation of the lower limbs and preventing amputation; improving treadmill walking distance; and improving ankle brachial pressure index was assessed. Adverse effects (in particular, major bleeding, gastrointestinal side-effects and side-effects leading to cessation of treatment) were also assessed. The efficacy of one or more antiplatelet agent(s) versus placebo or versus an alternative antiplatelet agent was considered.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched April 2011) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 2) at <A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">www.thecochranelibrary.com</A>. See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of the search strategy used to search CENTRAL. The Specialised Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) and is constructed from weekly electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED; and through handsearching relevant journals. The full list of the databases, journals and conference proceedings which have been searched, as well as the search strategies used, are described in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html">Specialised Register</A> section of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases (PVD) Group module in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(<A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">www.thecochranelibrary.com</A>).</P>

Where heterogeneity was identified (P &lt; 0.1 or I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%), we investigated the reason for heterogeneity. If no apparent reason was found, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to incorporate heterogeneity among studies. In the absence of heterogeneity, we used a fixed-effect model.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-02 18:07:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, antiplatelet treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all cause mortality compared with placebo in patients suffering from intermittent claudication (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98). When compared with aspirin, antiplatelet agent(s) other than aspirin were associated with a significantly lower risk of all cause mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93).</P>
<P>Cardiovascular mortality was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with antiplatelet compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94), but data were only reported on this outcome by trials which used ticlopidine as the drug of intervention. When compared with aspirin, antiplatelet agent(s) other than aspirin were not associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.15).</P>
<P>Composite cardiovascular events (combined fatal and non-fatal MI or stroke) appeared lower with antiplatelet treatment compared with placebo (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01) but this difference did not reach statistical significance.and there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of individual cardiovascular events i.e. total MI (fatal and non-fatal), fatal MI, non-fatal MI, total stroke (fatal and non-fatal), fatal stroke or non-fatal stroke, when antiplatelet was compared with placebo. Antiplatelet agent(s) other than aspirin were associated with a significantly lower risk of total cardiovascular events compared with aspirin (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98). This was mainly accounted for by the significantly lower risk of MI events (fatal and non-fatal) (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86) and specifically non-fatal MI (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.89).</P>
<P>Adverse events (GI symptoms, specifically dyspepsia, and adverse events leading to cessation of therapy) were significantly more common in participants who were treated with antiplatelet agent compared with placebo. The risk of major bleeding was not significantly different between groups treated with antiplatelet and placebo, although data on this outcome were limited. Meta-analysis for adverse events in trials comparing aspirin with antiplatelet agents other than aspirin was not performed due to lack of data.</P>
<P>Antiplatelet therapy significantly improved pain free walking distance when compared with placebo (MD 78.09, 95% CI 12.24 to 143.95). The risk of revascularisation was also significantly reduced by antiplatelet treatment compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97). The risk of amputation was not significantly different between antiplatelet treatment and placebo. Data were only available from one trial comparing antiplatelet agents other than aspirin with aspirin for risk of amputation and this did not show a statistically significant difference.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:37:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 12 trials on patients with IC (Fontaine Stage II). Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effects of varying classes of antiplatelets.</P>
<P>All cause and cardiovascular mortality reporting varied between trials. Composite outcomes, for example "vascular deaths" were used in many studies. Although this has the benefit of reducing the size of the trial required to detect a statistically significant difference, it can reduce our ability to understand the precise impact of antiplatelet use in reducing mortality and morbidity. In addition, not all components within these composite outcomes are of equal importance (<LINK REF="REF-Cordoba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordoba 2010</LINK>). For the purpose of this review, cardiovascular mortality was defined as death as a result of MI or stroke, and cardiovascular events was defined as fatal and non-fatal MI and stroke, these definitions were employed by most of the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-ADEP-1993" TYPE="STUDY">ADEP 1993</LINK> did not report fatal and non-fatal events separately and could therefore not be included in meta-analyses for these individual outcomes.</P>
<P>All cause and cardiovascular mortality reporting was further complicated by the variable lengths of follow-up. This review was therefore unable to determine a relative risk reduction specifically in relation to treatment length. The majority of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arcan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arcan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aukland-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Aukland 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Auteri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Auteri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coto-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coto 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EMATAP-1993" TYPE="STUDY">EMATAP 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Signorini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Signorini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonnesen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tonnesen 1993</LINK>) involved follow-up for up to a year. For the purpose of this review, cardiovascular mortality was defined as death as a result of myocardial infarction or stroke within 30 days of the event, and this definition was employed by most of the studies. The evidence for cardiovascular mortality should be interpreted as 30-day risk ratio or relative risk ratio (RRR).</P>
<P>The evidence for aspirin despite its widespread use remains unsubstantiated due to the lack of trials which fulfilled the inclusion criteria specifically for this review. The majority of evidence was derived from historical trials incorporating ticlopidine, which has since been supplanted by another thienopyridine (clopidogrel) due to the increased risk of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenic purpura (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moloney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moloney 1993</LINK>). As a result, ticlopidine is no longer widely used in Europe, the United States of America and Australasia. As thienopyridines, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine are prodrugs that are converted <I>in vivo</I> to pharmacologically active metabolites that inhibit platelet function after irreversibly binding to the platelet ADP P2Y<SUB>12</SUB> receptors. Clopidogrel has been shown to be at least as efficacious as ticlopidine but with better tolerability and fewer side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casella-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casella 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>). For this reason it is now used in preference to ticlopidine in most countries. We have extrapolated the results of ticlopidine to encompass the thienopyridine group of antiplatelets due to their similar efficacy and mechanism of action. The results of this review and its applicability must therefore be interpreted with this context in mind.</P>
<P>Four large RCTs were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-CLIPS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">CLIPS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHARISMA-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CHARISMA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowkes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fowkes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-POPADAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">POPADAD 2008</LINK>) as they recruited participants with asymptomatic PAD. Both <LINK REF="STD-Fowkes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fowkes 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-POPADAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">POPADAD 2008</LINK> only included asymptomatic participants.</P>
<P>Further trials were excluded because the study populations included a mixture of Fontaine stage patients and the data by the different Fontaine stages were not available. The review authors propose therefore that for future updates of this review, the review is broadened to include all stages of PAD including stage I (asymptomatic patients).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-03 11:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides a critical, quantitative review of antiplatelet agents in patients with IC. This review examined 12 different trials with 12,168 participants with varying methodology and outcome reporting. Apart from newer studies, most have unclear methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. There is a high rate of early discontinuation of treatment in both arms of the included trials which may potentially affect the final results. These cases were often not clearly reported and it was uncertain whether they were accounted for in studies published in the 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-10-03 11:31:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was limited to RCTs and excluded controlled clinical trials to limit the potential for bias. Most studies were described by their authors as randomised without details being given about the randomisation sequence generation or the type of precautions taken in relation to concealment of allocation. Incomplete outcome data was addressed in the majority of trials.</P>
<P>The main risk of bias from the review process was contributed by the lack of clear definition or variations in the definition of outcomes in the studies reviewed. One example of inconsistencies is that some trials incorporated deaths due to pulmonary embolism and "any deaths that were not clearly non-vascular" as "vascular deaths". For the purpose of this review, the review authors have strictly employed deaths due to MI and ischaemic stroke to define cardiovascular deaths. Other definitions vary between studies, for example, the definition for major bleeding was not always provided in the studies. Some studies only reported "bleeding", without any further details, while others provided a list of different types of bleeding. For the purpose of this review, a pragmatic approach was taken; the review authors included data which were labelled as "major bleeding", or when there was an attempt to distinguish more serious bleeding events from the minor ones. If data on individual components were available, these were also extracted and added up for the major bleeding outcomes.</P>
<P>In addition, a number of studies were excluded because patients with different stages of PAD (either Fontaine stage I participants or Fontaine stage III and IV patients) were included in the study populations and the results for the different stages were not presented separately.</P>
<P>The risk of data collection bias was reduced by independent data extractions by two review authors, and the use of predefined outcomes in our review protocol. Where there were inconsistencies in the data extracted, these were discussed between the review authors to reach an agreement.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-10-03 11:31:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review demonstrated statistically significant risk reductions in terms of all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality with antiplatelet treatment in patients with IC. This was consistent with the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>) report, which similarly showed a proportional reduction of 23% in serious vascular events in patients with PAD who were treated with antiplatelet agents compared with placebo. This review only included patients who had received at least three months of therapy as opposed to four weeks of treatment described in the ATC trial (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>) therefore reducing the potential of bias from under-reporting from a short period of treatment, and also allowing real assessment of antiplatelet agents and their longer term impact on mortality.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Basili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basili 2010</LINK> reviewed the effects of antiplatelets on the composite outcome of vascular events (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke of ischaemic or unknown aetiology or vascular death) in patients with IC (surgical series excluded) and found an odds ratio of 0.839 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.97) in favour of antiplatelet treatment compared with placebo. This meta-analysis from Basili and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Basili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basili 2010</LINK>) also found that even though aspirin reduced vascular events, this was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Another meta-analysis of aspirin in PAD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2009</LINK>) also showed no significant benefit of aspirin on cardiovascular events when compared with placebo or control. This review, however, showed that aspirin did accord a significant reduction in the risk of non-fatal stroke.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-10-03 11:38:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiplatelet agents have proven efficacy in patients with IC in terms of reduction in all cause and cardiovascular mortality. The review was limited to patients with stage II Fontaine and cannot be extrapolated to patients with stage I, III or IV Fontaine, or patients requiring surgical intervention (endovascular treatment, surgical bypass or amputation). The results were highly influenced by trials which used ticlopidine (a thienopyridine) as the intervention antiplatelet, but this agent is no longer available in many countries due to the availability of clopidogrel which has an improved safety profile. When aspirin was compared with other antiplatelet agent(s), there was no evidence that aspirin has any benefit over picotamide or clopidogrel. In fact, there was a reduction in risk of all cause mortality in patients treated with an alternative antiplatelet compared with those in the aspirin group. There is a need to reconsider the use of aspirin as the drug of choice in most clinical practice guidelines in view of the lack of evidence on aspirin compared with the evidence for the thienopyridine class of antiplatelet agents.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, antiplatelet agents have a significant risk of adverse events (GI side-effects, specifically dyspepsia and adverse events leading to cessation of therapy) and both healthcare professionals and patients need to be aware of this potential harm. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of major bleeding between antiplatelet treatment and placebo, but the latter outcome has to be interpreted with caution as it was only reported in only two trials with a relatively small number of participants and the result demonstrated wide 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:38:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodology of RCTs in this area of research needs to be better standardised in order to allow for future meta-analysis. Power calculations should be performed to ensure sufficient patient recruitment. The authors recommend that future trialists should consistently report on all cause and cardiovascular mortality. For the latter outcome, this should be defined as death within 30 days of either MI or ischaemic stroke. Follow-up length should be increased to at least one year to allow a consistent reporting of risk reduction which would be clinically meaningful. Risk from cancer deaths have always been defined in relation to time i.e. either one-year, three-year or five-year, and it is time similar reporting in patients with IC is performed. Separate reporting of fatal and non-fatal MI and stroke would be helpful to allow clear distinction of the effects of antiplatelet agents on these morbidities, even when a composite outcome is used as the primary outcome.</P>
<P>There was no consistent definition of major bleeding and the review authors would strongly recommend using the following for future trials:</P>
<UL>
<LI>death due to major bleeding,</LI>
<LI>a decrease in haemoglobin concentration of 2g/dL or more,</LI>
<LI>transfusion of at least 2 units of blood,</LI>
<LI>bleeding from a retroperitoneal, intracranial, or intraocular site,</LI>
<LI>a serious or life-threatening clinical event,</LI>
<LI>requiring surgical or medical intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Due to the paucity of data on use of aspirin and its widespread use in the western world, there is an urgent need for multicentre trials to examine the effects of aspirin in patients with IC.</P>

<P>The interpretation of the types of participants, the interventions and outcomes as described in protocol of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Robless-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2003</LINK>) were in some instances unclear and the reviewers have therefore provided clarification by providing definitions of patients with PAD, antiplatelet agents and cardiovascular events and adverse events.</P>
<P>The initial published protocol proposed to perform analysis on quality of life (QoL) and cost effectiveness. However, none of the studies included in this review reported these data, and it was not possible to perform these analyses. The types of studies included in the review were narrowed down compared with the protocol by excluding quasi-randomised and cross-over trials to reduce the risk of biases from non-random sequence generation and difficulty in attributing the events to the intervention in question, respectively. The required length of the intervention was increased from 4 weeks to 3 months in order to reduce the potential of bias from under-reporting from a short period of treatment, and also to allow real assessment of antiplatelet agents and their longer term impact on mortality.</P>
