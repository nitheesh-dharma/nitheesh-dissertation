<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Omega-3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This systematic review investigated the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. Five randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the review. Only one trial provided data that could be analysed, investigating ethyl-EPA as an adjunctive treatment in a mixed outpatient population. Some positive benefits were found for depressive symptoms but not for mania, and no adverse events were reported. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base any clear recommendations concerning omega-3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. However, given the general health benefits and safety of omega-3, the preliminary evidence from this review provides a strong case for well-powered, high-quality trials in specific index populations.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bipolar disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder and is amongst the top thirty causes of worldwide disability. Mood stabilisers are the primary pharmacological intervention, both in the treatment of acute episodes and in prophylaxis. There is, however, mounting evidence that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in psychiatric conditions, particularly those involving disturbances of mood. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as either a monotherapy or an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches of the following databases were performed: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/2/2008, Supplementary searches were carried out on Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, CCDAN Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. The search strategy also included cited reference searching, personal contact with all authors of studies initially included and contact with the omega-3 producing pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Studies involving males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder qualified for inclusion. Studies using any type or dose of omega-3 fatty acid treatment as monotherapy or in addition to standard pharmacotherapy were eligible. The primary outcome was symptom severity; and secondary outcomes were adverse effects, dropout and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. All relevant data were extracted. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcome data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies met inclusion criteria for the review, however, methodological quality was highly variable. Only one study, involving 75 participants, provided data for analysis, and showed a benefit of active treatment over control for depression symptom levels (WMD -3.93, 95% CI -7.00 to -0.86)and Clinical Global Impression scores (WMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.17) but not for mania (WMD -2.81, 95% CI -7.68 to 1.90). No serious adverse effects were reported in the five studies. The pattern of dropout was highly variable between studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Results from one study showed positive effects of omega-3 as an adjunctive treatment for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. These findings must be regarded with caution owing to the limited data available. There is an acute need for well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials in this field.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>Description of the condition</B>
<BR/>Bipolar disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder and is amongst the top thirty causes of worldwide disability (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). It represents a major health problem due to the high rate of disability and increased mortality. The recurring, episodic nature of the mood disturbances involved can cause long-term damage to the psychological, occupational and social functioning of those affected. </P>
<P>
<B>Description of the intervention</B>
<BR/>Successful management of bipolar disorder requires treatment of both manic and depressive episodes. Mood stabilisers and atypical antipsychotics are thus the primary pharmacological interventions, both in the treatment of acute episodes and in prophylaxis. These have been defined as medications which 'alleviate the frequency and/or intensity of manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder and further, do not increase the frequency or severity of any of the subtypes or course variables of bipolar disorder' (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use and after five decades remains a first choice in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Sachs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachs 2000</LINK>). In the long term it has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide and normalise cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ahrens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrens 1995</LINK>). However, in addition to its narrow therapeutic window and unwanted side effects, the beneficial effects of lithium can be slow to appear and it frequently fails to stabilise mood completely (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>). It is also thought to be less effective in some subgroups, particularly patients with mixed affective states (<LINK REF="REF-McElroy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The leading adjunctive and alternative treatments to lithium in bipolar disorder are anticonvulsants such as valproate and carbamazepine. In Europe, valproate has been used in the treatment of acute mania since 1966 (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 1966</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2003</LINK>). Although there is evidence of the efficacy of these treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2003</LINK>), they also have adverse effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms, neurological symptoms, alopecia, lethargy, dizziness and haematological dysfunction. Pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity are rare but potentially serious, and sometimes fatal, complications (<LINK REF="REF-McElroy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 1989</LINK>). Other notable adverse effects are weight gain and encephalopathy symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Perucca-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perucca 2002</LINK>). Teratogenicity has also been reported in association with first trimester use (<LINK REF="REF-Jeavons-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeavons 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Battino-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battino 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>How the intervention might work</B>
<BR/>Given some of the limitations of both lithium and the anti-convulsants, attention has been turning to other possible treatments for bipolar disorder, both alternative and adjunctive to current treatments. One such candidate is the use of certain highly unsaturated fatty acids which play key roles in brain structure and function but must be derived from dietary sources (<LINK REF="REF-Yehuda-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yehuda 1999</LINK>). There are two types of such essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6. The omega-3 are found principally in oily fish and seafood although some can be derived from green vegetables. Those of the omega-6 type are found in soft margarine, most vegetable oils and animal fats. Omega-6 tend to be plentiful in most modern western diets while omega-3 are often relatively lacking. A high dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 has been linked with vulnerability to many disorders of physical and mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Why it is important to do this review</B>
<BR/>There is mounting evidence that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in psychiatric conditions (see <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK> for a review of these). This evidence includes RCTs in conditions such as schizophrenia, depression and borderline personality disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Peet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nemets-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemets 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanarini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanarini 2003</LINK>). Biochemical evidence of fatty acid abnormalities in cell membranes helps support this theory (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadik-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadik 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 1998a</LINK>). Furthermore, epidemiological studies have indicated that across countries, rates of bipolar disorder are negatively associated with the consumption of fish and seafood (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbeln-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbeln 2003</LINK>) suggesting that omega-3 deficiency may also be a factor in this condition. This combined evidence has raised the question of whether omega-3 fatty acids may be a useful adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. A comprehensive and up to date systematic review is timely to summarise the current evidence base on the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of bipolar disorder.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as either a monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>To investigate the effects of pure preparations of specific omega-3 fatty acids such as Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or mixtures. ALA is found in some vegetable oils such as flax oil, while EPA and DHA are found together in fish oils as sold over the counter in pharmacies, health food stores or drug stores</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', the authors were contacted for confirmation that the study was truly randomised in design. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>
<B>Patient characteristics and diagnosis</B>
<BR/>Males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder meeting International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) Code F31* (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) 296* (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) qualified. All subtypes of bipolar disorder (rapid cycling- i.e. those suffering from four or more affective episodes per year, types I and II and other) were included; cyclothymia was excluded. </P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>The studies included in this review examined bipolar patients only. Any trials that involved heterogeneous groups of participants, including schizo-affective disorder or unipolar depressive disorder (diagnoses approximating to ICD 10 F25 and DSM 295.70, and ICD 10 F33 and DSM IV 296.3, respectively) did not qualify.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>Any type of omega-3 fatty acid treatment as monotherapy or additional to standard pharmacotherapy; any dose. There are broadly two types of omega-3 treatment of relevance.<BR/>1. Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (containing more than four double-bonds): these include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)(20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6 n-3) either individually or in combination; and either in the more common triglyceride forms (as found in ordinary fish oils) or in ethyl-ester forms such as ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA). <BR/>2. Less highly unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (containing 3 or 4 double-bonds) usually from vegetarian sources (e.g. flax oil), such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3 n-3)</P>
<P>
<B>Control comparisons</B>
<BR/>Standard care, defined as the normal level of psychiatric care and medication provided in the area where the trial was conducted.</P>
<P>
<B>Main comparisons</B>
<BR/>Comparisons were performed between omega-3 fatty acids of whatever type and standard care.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B> <BR/>Two reviewers (PM, AJR) independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved, with the assistance of JL. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction and management <BR/>
</B>Data extraction was performed independently by two review authors (PM, AJR) and, where further clarification was needed, the authors of trials were contacted by email to provide missing data. All relevant data concerning trial design, patient characteristics, comparisons and outcomes were compiled using data extraction sheets. Data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist, if the study was single-blind). Unpublished instruments are more likely to report statistically significant findings than those that have been peer reviewed and published (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). On this basis studies were given a quality rating of A (adequate), B (unclear), and C (inadequate). If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus. In addition, aspects of quality such as whether the trial was of a double blind design and reporting of withdrawals and dropouts was described. Where adequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were not provided, the authors have been contacted in order to obtain further information. We also reported on the objectives of each study, source and demographics of the participants and other exclusion criteria (in order to assess generalisability) and the source of funding of the study and possible conflicts of interest. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Measures of treatment effect<BR/>
</B>It was planned to conduct meta-analyses to combine comparable outcome measures across studies, with all overall effects calculated using inverse variance methods. Dichotomous outcome measures were to be combined by calculating an overall risk ratio (RR), together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcome measures (including scale data) were to be combined by calculating the overall standardised mean difference, with 95% CIs, using Hedges g (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Where possible, it was planned to present endpoint data in this review. Where both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then only the former would be reported. </P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cluster randomisation</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Where trials used clustered randomisation, we expected that results would be presented with proper controls for clustering (robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If unclear whether a cluster-randomised trial had used appropriate controls for clustering (autocorrelated data), the primary author would be contacted for additional information. Where appropriate controls were not used, individual participant data sets would be requested, and these data sets would be re-analysed using multilevel models which control for clustering; effect estimates and standard errors would then be meta-analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse variance method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). If appropriate controls were not used and it was impossible to obtain the full set of individual participant data, it was planned to control for clustering using the procedures outlined in Adams (2004) and <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>. That is, when outcome measures are dichotomous, the number of events and number of participants per trial arm is divided by the design effect [1 + (1 - m) * r], where m is the average cluster size and r is the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). When outcome measures are continuous, the number of participants per trial arm is divided by the design effect, while leaving the mean values unchanged. The average cluster size (m) is calculated using the details provided by each study (total N and number of clusters). To determine the ICC, the reviewers would first seek estimates in the primary trials on a study-by-study basis. However, if these values were not reported, the reviewers would seek external estimates of the ICC that are appropriate to each trial context and average cluster size (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>; Ukoumunne 1999). In this case, statistical guidance would be sought from the Cochrane Methods Group and external experts. If there was insufficient information to control for clustering, outcome data from cluster-randomised trials would be entered in RevMan using individuals as the units of analysis and then sensitivity analysis would be used to assess the potential biasing effects of clustered trials that did not provide adequate controls for clustering. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Crossover trials</I>
</B>
<BR/>All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms are reported in this review. If crossover studies were found, it was planned to include these up to the crossover only. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Multiple treatment arms</I>
</B>
<BR/>When two or more eligible intervention groups were compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers form a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, it was planned to combine the eligible intervention groups for statistical analysis. If a single eligible intervention group had been compared to multiple eligible control groups, no-treatment or treatment-as-usual controls would have been chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. </P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
<BR/>It was planned to use intention to treat analysis for all studies in this review. Authors of trials were contacted by email to provide missing data. </P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>It was planned to use random-effects models, because it was anticipated that studies may have included somewhat different treatments or populations.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity </B>
<BR/>Where sufficient studies were included in the review, it was planned to assess heterogeneity by inspecting a graphical display of the results and by quantifying inconsistency using the I<SUP>2</SUP>, which describes the amount of variability resulting from heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases</B>
<BR/>It was planned to enter data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). As there were very few studies currently satisfying all criteria for this review, this analysis would not currently be very informative, although it may become more so as additional studies become available. </P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis</B>
<BR/>Where sufficient studies become available for inclusion in future updates of the review, sub-group analyses will be conducted, depending on advances in this area of work. Obvious candidate sub-groups include:<BR/>1. Type of omega-3 fatty acid<BR/>2. Dosage of omega-3 fatty acid<BR/>3. Patient characteristics .</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis </B>
<BR/>Where sufficient studies become available for inclusion in future updates of the review, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which the effect of including studies with high attrition rates (&gt;25%) will be investigated. The impact of allocation concealment will also be assessed through excluding studies rated 'C', and then excluding studies rated 'B'. </P>

</B>
<BR/>Of the five studies identified as eligible for the review, all were randomised controlled trials, and were conducted in the UK, Taiwan and USA. Four studies were conducted in outpatient settings with patients meeting criteria for either bipolar I or bipolar II. The other study involved acute patients hospitalised for bipolar disorder and manic episode (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK>). All were adjunctive trials, but the other treatments varied considerably between studies. A description of the design, sample size, participants and interventions are presented for each trial individually below.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK> <BR/>This four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial explored the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. Eligible patients were those newly hospitalised in the acute manic phase of bipolar disorder who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder and manic episode and had a minimum score of 20 on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Participants who had the mixed type of bipolar disorder, substance dependence, physical illnesses or other Axis I psychiatric disorders or who were at serious risk of violence or suicide were excluded. Participants were allowed no psychoactive drugs and were required to suspend all prescribed medications, with the exception of lorazepam (which alleviates insomnia, agitation and restlessness). </P>
<P>All participants received 2000mg/day of valproate. In addition, treatment group patients received 5 capsules twice daily of a supplement providing a total per day of 4.4g EPA and 2.4g DHA from fish oils (i.e. in triglyceride form), while control group members received 5 capsules of olive oil (identical in appearance to the treatment supplement) twice daily. Due to the strict rules in the study design against concomitant medication during the trial, only 15 participants were enrolled in the study. One subject withdrew consent within the first week, leaving a total of 14 participants who completed the trial. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK>
<BR/>The aim of this study was to explore the effects of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA as an adjunctive treatment for out-patients with bipolar disorder. The 12-week study, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, included adult males and females (aged 18-70) who satisfied DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder I or II and scored at least 10 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). All participants were allowed to continue all associated psychotropic medication during the trial. Participants were recruited on the referral of their treating physicians or through advertisements in patient groups' newsletters. Of the 93 eligible participants screened by the researchers, 75 met all requirements and consented to participation in the study. At baseline, all participants underwent assessment using the HRSD, the YMRS and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale. </P>
<P>Participants were randomised into one of three groups, each taking 4 pills daily: 1) active treatment, receiving a total of 1g/day of EPA, 2) active treatment, receiving a total of 2g/day of EPA, or control treatment, receiving a total of 2g/day of a placebo (liquid paraffin). The two different active treatment doses, both involving pure ethyl-EPA, were included as a result of previous studies, which had found '2g/day of ethyl-EPA to be the optimal dose for schizophrenia and 1g/day for unipolar depression' (p.46). The initial exploration of results showed that there was no significant difference in effect between the two active doses; the researchers combined these two groups in the final data analysis. Therefore, these groups were combined in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK>
<BR/>This study consisted of a 4-month placebo-controlled, randomised trial of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression and rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Participants were male and female adults (aged 20-73) who satisfied DSM-IV criteria for types I or II (or not otherwise specified) bipolar disorder. Participants also had to meet DSM-IV requirements for a major depressive episode or for rapid cycling and either mania/hypomania or major depression to qualify for the study. This study examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunctive treatment only, and thus all participants were 'required to receive at least one mood-stabilizing medication at therapeutic doses or plasma concentrations' (p.1020). After all screening procedures were complete, 121 participants were randomised into treatment and control groups. 5 participants, assessed only at baseline, were excluded from the analysis, leaving a total of 116 participants for the final analysis.</P>
<P>Participants randomised into the treatment group received 6g of pure ethyl EPA daily; control group participants were administered a matching placebo of liquid paraffin, indistinguishable from the treatment capsules by 'size, shape, color, odor and after taste' (p. 1021). The treatment dose of EPA, as well as many other characteristics of the study design, was based on that used by <LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK> in their 1999 study (although as noted below, <LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK> used supplements containing fish oils, providing 3.4g of DHA in addition to just over 6g of EPA).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2006</LINK>
<BR/>This small pilot study explored the potential effects of omega-3 (DHA), coupled with a psychosocial therapy program, in women suffering from bipolar disorder (I or II). Participants were aged between 27 and 42 and had a clinical status of 'recovered', i.e. 'no more than two moderate mood symptoms, for six months before study entry' (p.318). The study focused particularly on bipolar women looking to discontinue psychiatric medications while attempting to conceive, which limited the pool of eligible participants, although the results could be relevant to any female bipolar patient looking to discontinue psychiatric medications. </P>
<P>Ten eligible women agreed to participate in the study and were randomised into active treatment (2g/day DHA from an algal source) or control (matched placebo). All participants were also encouraged to participate in a 'collaborative care program for pregnancy' (CCP-P), a psychosocial therapy program focused on psychoeducation and self-help strategies to maintain wellness and prevent relapse. The 52-week trial began with patients commencing omega-3/placebo treatment in addition to their baseline medications. Starting at the sixth week, participants' medications were tapered 25% per week for four weeks before stopping all baseline medications. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This 4-month parallel-group pilot study implemented a placebo-controlled, double-blind design in which bipolar disorder outpatients were randomised into treatment (receiving omega-3 supplements) or control (receiving a placebo). Men and women between 18 and 65 years of age who satisfied DSM-IV criteria for types I or II of bipolar disorder, had experienced at least one manic or hypomanic episode in the past year, and had no significant medical and psychiatric comorbidity were invited to participate in the study. Patients were allowed to continue other medical and psychiatric treatment they had been receiving in conjunction with the disorder. </P>
<P>A total of 44 participants were selected for participation and were randomised into groups, but only 30 were retained for the duration of the trial. Four of the participants dropped out before the end of the first month because of noncompliance and ten participants had not completed four months in the trial when it was ended. Participants in the treatment group were administered 7 capsules of omega-3 fatty acid concentrate from fish oils (each containing 440mg EPA, 240mg DHA, and trace amounts of antioxidants) twice daily. This high dose (6.2g EPA and 3.4g DHA daily) was chosen 'to avoid a potentially ineffective low dose' (p.408), which the researchers were concerned could confound the results. Control group participants received seven capsules of olive oil (identical to treatment group supplements) twice daily. </P>

<B>
<BR/>Overall methodological quality of studies</B>
<BR/>Allocation concealment was variable across studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK> did not report on this, while <LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK> were both rated as A, and <LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK> were rated as B. Blinding was adequate in the trials conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK> but unclear in the <LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2006</LINK> study and not reported by <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK> used adequate methods in order to blind trialists, but found that some participants were able to guess their allocation from aftertaste as explained below. Dropout ranged considerably across trials, from <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK> at 12.5% (2/16) through <LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK>, 17% (13/75), <LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK> 32% (14/44), and <LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2006</LINK> 50% (5/10), to <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK> 54% (65/121). Sources of funding for the five trials were mixed, but most were collaborations of government, charity and/or nutraceutical companies. The methods of analysis used were mixed, but intention to treat was used in three of the five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK>). </P>

<BR/>Compliance in this study was very high, but this study showed a number of limitations, including its small population size, as well as the strict participation requirements, which could limit generalisability. The short duration of four weeks is another limitation, as the turnover of fatty acids in the brain is slow. Full repletion of omega-3 in neuronal membranes takes up to three months (<LINK REF="REF-Bourre-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourre 1989</LINK>), although more recent studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy do suggest that some improvement in membrane fluidity may be apparent within a month (Hirashima 2004). The authors did not report mean scores or standard deviations on any outcome measure. The primary author was contacted for full data on all study participants in order for an intention-to-treat analysis to be performed but has not yet forwarded the required information. This research was supported by grants from the Taiwan National Science Council, the Taiwan Department of Health and China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK>
<BR/>This was one of the best conducted studies included in this review. Its greatest limitation was that very stringent exclusion criteria were imposed on the participants (such as evidence of alcohol or illicit substance dependence, risk of imminent suicide; history of poor adherence to treatment; and poor attendance at appointments). This may mean that the study population is not representative of most bipolar patients presenting in general psychiatric settings. The dropout rate for this study was however commendably low (17%). Compliance was assessed by pill count but findings were not reported. The study was supported by Laxdale Ltd, who supplied the ethyl-EPA used in the trial, although methods of blinding and allocation appeared adequate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Keck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2006</LINK>
<BR/>While this study utilised an Intention-to-treat analysis design, it suffered from significant attrition (65 participants, 54% of total study population). This suggests either some impracticality of the study design (which involved nine study visits over four months) or other factors that reduced motivation. Reported reasons for dropout were 'poor treatment response (77%), side effects (9%), and noncompliance (8%)' (p.1021). The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Version (IDS-C) (<LINK REF="REF-Trivedi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivedi 2004</LINK>) was the primary outcome measure, but the authors did not report mean scores or standard deviations on any outcome measure. The primary author was contacted for full data on all study participants in order for an intention-to-treat analysis to be performed, but has not yet forwarded the required information. The study was supported by the Stanley Medical research Institute, an American Psychiatric Association (APA)/Lilly Psychiatry Research Fellowship, a National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression Young Investigator Award and Laxdale Ltd, who supplied the ethyl-eicosapentanoate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2006</LINK>
<BR/>The obvious limitations of this pilot study include the very small population size (n=10), length of study (52 weeks), inclusion criteria (women trying to conceive and become medication-free) and supplementary psycho-social treatment options. Only five of the ten women enrolled into this trial completed the full duration (two active, 3 placebo). Participants who showed significant mood worsening were prematurely excused from the trial so as to avoid full relapse (three active, one placebo). The final active group member discontinued due to non-compliance. Funding for this study was provided in part with Federal funds from the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health. Martek Biosciences provided the DHA and matching placebo.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stoll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoll 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This pilot study also had a number of significant limitations, the most notable of which was the lack of an intention to treat analysis. Data were not included from nearly a third of the study population owing to the a priori design, and the imposition of a stopping rule. Participants were required to complete at least one month of treatment in order to be included in the analysis (for absorption reasons). The protocol also included a pre-planned, blinded interim analysis when 20 participants had either failed or completed four months of treatment. When this interim analysis showed significant group differences, the trial was ended prematurely for ethical reasons. Four participants had already dropped out (two for non-compliance, 1 for gastro-intestinal side-effects and one for concern over the possibility of receiving the placebo) and 10 participants had not yet reached the four month point. Another limitation flagged by the authors was that the fish oil and placebo supplements were not matched for after-taste, which led 86% of treatment group and 63% of control group participants to correctly guess their group allocation. The primary author was contacted for full data on all study participants in order for an intention-to-treat analysis to be performed but these data have not yet been received. This study was supported by a grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Depression. Treatment capsules (active and placebo) were provided by the Fish Oil Test Materials Program, a joint research program of the National Institutes of Health and the Southeastern Fisheries Science Center.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>To date, only one eligible study has provided full data from intention to treat analysis on the main outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK>). Therefore, this was the only trial with data for meta-analyses. In view of the limited data currently available in this field, however, the results of each study as reported by the trialists may provide some useful information to guide future research.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition with very serious health implications as well as cost burdens for both the patient and society. Standard treatments have been shown to have benefits but do not achieve a complete remission of symptoms in most cases and also carry undesirable side-effects. For these reasons, any treatment that could improve the clinical management of this condition are worth serious consideration. Findings from this review indicate that omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils (EPA and DHA) appear to be capable of ameliorating at least some symptoms of bipolar disorder in at least some patients. Furthermore, there is no evidence of adverse side effects from this intervention. Indeed dietary supplementation with these omega-3 fatty acids is already recommended for a range of other (mainly physical) health conditions including cardiovascular disease and some immune disorders. For these reasons, the APA has already made treatment recommendations of at least 1gm per day of EPA plus DHA for patients with mood disorders or major psychotic illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>) even though, as this review shows, the RCTs required to show clear benefits for psychiatric symptoms have not yet been forthcoming. </P>
<P>The studies reviewed here suggest that omega-3 may be most effective at alleviating depression symptoms as measured by the HDRS and broader everyday symptomatology as measured by the CGI. It is noteworthy that no trials have shown any benefits for manic symptoms as assessed by the YMRS. The possible efficacy of omega-3 for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder is consistent with preliminary findings emerging from similar trials in unipolar depression (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Possible mechanisms for any antidepressant effects of omega-3s are not known, but many candidates exist given that omega-3s are essential nutrients that affect almost every physiological and biochemical system. They can influence a wide range of neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin and norepenephrine, either directly or via their effects on membrane fluidity. They also influence both cardiovascular and immune system functioning as noted above, which may well help to explain some of their effects on the brain. </P>
<P>Firm conclusions from this review are inevitably limited for a number of reasons, primarily the fact that there were only a few small studies eligible for inclusion, with only 292 participants in all. Existing trials have involved different populations ranging from hospitalised acute patients with mania through mixed outpatients with bipolar I or II to women wanting to conceive who were seeking to become medication-free. Furthermore, no two studies administered an active treatment of the same composition and dose. Two studies used EPA and DHA in combination as provided by fish oils, two others used pure ethyl EPA while one used pure DHA from an algal source. Similarly, doses ranged from 1g/day to 9.6g/day. The current balance of evidence suggests more positive effects for mood disorders from supplements combining both EPA and DHA, or containing EPA alone (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>) in a dose of at least 1g/day. Clearly further work is required to explore optimal treatment compositions and dosages.<BR/> <BR/>Duration of trials ranged from one month (probably too short given the slow absorption of fatty acids into neuronal membranes) (<LINK REF="REF-Bourre-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourre 2003</LINK>) to one year (probably too long for good patient compliance with a trial) . Currently, there is simply not enough existing evidence, and what evidence is currently available is of such a varied and often-times questionable nature that no reliable conclusions may be drawn. The <LINK REF="STD-Frangou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frangou 2006</LINK> study, which is of the highest quality yet published, showed encouraging results for omega-3 treatment as an adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment. The composition of the omega-3 treatment (pure ethyl-EPA) and the dose (1-2 g/day) are both comparable to those of other positive studies using omega-3 supplementation in treatment of psychological disorders. Researchers must perform additional trials with similar omega-3 formulations and attempt to replicate these results. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Results from one study showed positive effects of omega-3 as an adjunctive treatment for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder, however, these findings must be regarded with caution owing to the limited data available. Furthermore, on current evidence it could only be considered as an adjunctive treatment, not as an alternative to standard pharmacological treatment. Importantly, this type of intervention does not appear to have any significant adverse effects and may have benefits for general health. Practitioners should consider these findings and discuss them with patients who may be considering standard treatment additions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials in this field are clearly lacking and the need for such high-quality primary research is acute. Study populations need to be more pragmatic reflecting those found in outpatient settings. Study duration should be long enough to ensure that the omega-3 fatty acids can be fully absorbed into brain cell membranes, and therefore should ideally be three months at a minimum. Finally, the dose and composition of the omega-3 supplement should be modelled on current evidence, which suggests that 1-2 g/day of a an all-EPA or majority EPA supplement may be the most effective form of the treatment, although further research into the efficacy of varied compositions and doses of omega-3 treatment is also necessary.</P>
