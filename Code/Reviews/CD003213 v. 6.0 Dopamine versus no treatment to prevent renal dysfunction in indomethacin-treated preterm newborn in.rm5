<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-15 13:34:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dopamine has not been shown to prevent adverse effects of indomethacin on the kidneys of preterm babies. Indomethacin is a drug used in preterm babies to prevent brain hemorrhage or to help close off PDA (patent ductus arteriosus - when a channel between the lungs and heart does not close off after birth as it should). Indomethacin often causes fluid retention and reduced flow of urine, which can sometimes cause deterioration in kidney (renal) function. The drug dopamine is sometimes used along with indomethacin to try and prevent negative impact on the kidneys. The review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show there is any value in giving dopamine to babies being treated with indomethacin.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-06 21:53:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indomethacin therapy for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) frequently causes oliguria and occasionally more serious renal dysfunction. Low dose dopamine has been suggested as a means for preventing this side effect.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-08-13 14:13:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether dopamine therapy prevents indomethacin-mediated deterioration in renal function in the preterm newborn infant without serious adverse effects. Subgroup analyses were planned to assess the effects of dopamine on patients given indomethacin as prophylaxis of intraventricular hemorrhage, and patients given indomethacin as treatment of PDA.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-05 15:32:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) were used. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1974 to 2009) and CINAHL (2001 to 2009). In addition, we contacted the principal investigators if necessary to ascertain required information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized studies of the effects of dopamine on urine output, glomerular filtration rate, fluid balance or incidence of renal failure, in preterm newborn infants receiving indomethacin. The comparison group should have received no dopamine.</P>

<P>We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and those of the CNRG. For categorical outcomes, we calculated typical estimates for relative risk and risk difference. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. Fixed effect models were assumed for meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-13 12:59:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were found (total number randomized patients 75) that fulfilled the entry criteria for this review. All were single center trials that enrolled NICU patients receiving indomethacin for symptomatic PDA. There are no (or only partial) results for effects of dopamine on several of the primary outcomes, including death before discharge, serious intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or renal failure. There has been inadequate investigation of the effects of dopamine on cerebral perfusion or cardiac output, or GI complications, or endocrine toxicity. Dopamine improved urine output [WMD 0.68 ml/kg/hour (95% CI 0.22, 1.44)], but there was no evidence of effect on serum creatinine (WMD 2.04 micromoles/liter, CI -17.90, 21.97) or the incidence of oliguria (urine output &lt; 1 ml/kg/hour) (RR 0.73, CI 0.35, 1.54). There was no evidence of effect of dopamine on the frequency of failure to close the ductus arteriosus (RR 1.11, CI 0.56, 2.19).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from randomized trials to support the use of dopamine to prevent renal dysfunction in indomethacin-treated preterm infants.</P>

<P>
<B>Use and side effects of indomethacin in neonates:</B>
</P>
<P>Indomethacin has been used in preterm infants for two main indications:</P>
<OL>
<LI>treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (<LINK REF="REF-Nehgme-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nehgme 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>prophylaxis of intraventricular hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 1997</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The two most frequent side effects of indomethacin therapy are oliguria (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1994</LINK>) and decrease in cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Mosca-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 1997</LINK>). More uncommon, but serious potential side effects of indomethacin include renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Cifuentes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifuentes 1979</LINK>), hyperkalemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Alpan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alpan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuhl-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhl 1985</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-13 13:01:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Rationale for using dopamine in association with indomethacin, putative benefits and risks:</B> <BR/>If oliguria can be prevented and overall fluid status improved, then other outcomes could also be affected. Dopamine is often administered in the hope that its actions on specific dopaminergic receptors in the renal vasculature will increase renal perfusion by selectively mediating renal vasodilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1972</LINK>), thus leading to increased renal blood flow, increased glomerular filtration rate and increased urine output. However, there is no reliable evidence that dopaminergic vasodilatation occurs in the neonatal mammalian or human renal circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1996</LINK>). Potential interactions of dopamine with indomethacin also exist. One study showed that in healthy human adults the renal vasodilation of low dose dopamine was prevented by indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Manoogian-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manoogian 1988</LINK>). It may be that the usual physiologic cascade which follows dopaminergic stimulation in renal vascular muscle involves release of prostacyclin and, therefore, might be affected by indomethacin treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-13 13:02:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the potential serious side effects of indomethacin on kidney, gut and brain, indomethacin is frequently used for the medical treatment of PDA. Furosemide has been used in an attempt to prevent oliguria in indomethacin-treated preterm infants, but in a systematic review Brion 2001 found no evidence of benefit. A systematic review of the effects of dopamine in indomethacin-treated infants has not been reported, and is needed.</P>
<P>The effects of indomethacin on renal and gut blood flow might well differ depending on the blood flow to these areas prior to indomethacin, and therefore might exacerbate the reduction in renal and gastrointestinal blood flow which is related to the PDA. Therefore, we plan a subgroup analysis in patients receiving indomethacin as prophylaxis and in those receiving indomethacin as treatment of PDA.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 10:35:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite there having been three randomized controlled trials, only 75 babies have been randomized in total. The power of the individual studies, or of this systematic review, to detect effects on clinical outcomes is therefore limited.</P>
<P>The mechanism of oliguria caused by indomethacin is not well understood. Other cyclooxygenase inhibitors appear to cause less oliguria (<LINK REF="REF-Bergamo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergamo 1989</LINK>), and in newborn infants these other agents have less effect on renal blood flow than does indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Pezzati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzati 1999</LINK>). Differential effects of various cyclooxygenase inhibitors on the kidney may depend on the ratio of their activity on the two cyclooxygenase isozymes, COX-1, which preferentially mediates renal side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1998</LINK>), and COX-2, which preferentially mediates the antiinflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>). Indomethacin is more active against COX-1 than ibuprofen, which may explain the increased frequency and severity of renal side effects. In newborn piglets indomethacin administration affects a number of regional circulations (renal, gastrointestinal and cerebral) more than other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Chemtob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chemtob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speziale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speziale 1999</LINK>); actions of indomethacin other than cyclo-oxygenase inhibition may be in part responsible, such as the propensity for causing an increase in concentrations for lipoxygenase products. The majority of infants who receive indomethacin have some decrease in urine flow, and the best predictor of severe oliguria is the pre-indomethacin urine output (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1994</LINK>). Most often oliguria is self limited and of little significance. However major complications do occasionally occur (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1994</LINK>), and hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and fluid retention requiring adjustments of fluid therapy are fairly common. Rarely, renal failure may occur. Fluid retention could possibly lead to worse pulmonary outcomes. Studies of agents to prevent oliguria are thus warranted. Although dopamine in this review did cause a slight increase in urine output, this result was largely due to one study with very small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Seri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seri 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>As noted above there is little evidence that dopamine improves either renal perfusion or renal function in the newborn. Indeed the role of dopamine for this indication has recently been called into question for adult patients (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCrory-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrory 1997</LINK>), and recent systematic reviews of the effects of low dose dopamine on renal function in the critically ill adult (<LINK REF="REF-Kellum-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellum 2001</LINK>) and the critically ill infant and child (<LINK REF="REF-Prins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 2001</LINK>) also show no evidence of effect .</P>
<P>Changes in intestinal blood flow parallel those in renal blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Mosca-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 1997</LINK>); they may mediate an increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhl-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhl 1985</LINK>), and necrotizing enterocolitis which has been demonstrated in some studies. Indomethacin may reduce both cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants with PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Mosca-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 1997</LINK>). Indomethacin also increase bleeding time (<LINK REF="REF-Corazza-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corazza 1984</LINK>). All of these side effects should be taken into account when considering indomethacin therapy in the preterm infant with a PDA.</P>
<P>Dopamine has uncertain effects on the cerebral circulation. Thus, the effects of combined dopamine and indomethacin therapy on cerebral perfusion in newborn infants warrants study. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter. Although systemic infusion of dopamine largely does not cross the blood brain barrier and does not affect the majority of CNS dopamine receptors, such therapy has been shown to have other effects. Dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary and the hypothalamus are functionally outside of the blood brain barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 1996</LINK>). It appears that systemic dopamine infusion suppresses pituitary function and administration of dopamine therefore might worsen the apparent hypothyroid state that is common in preterm infants and is statistically associated with poorer developmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Wassenaer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wassenaer 1999</LINK>). Dopamine may also decrease growth hormone and prolactin secretion. Dopamine receptors in the carotid body are also affected by systemic dopamine infusion, and respiratory depression may result. Thus, adequate evaluation of the efficacy and of the potential toxicities of dopamine in clinical usage is necessary.</P>
<P>The currently available data do not support the use of dopamine at any dose to protect renal function during indomethacin therapy. The use of dopamine for this indication in preterm infants is not supported by the published studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomized trials to support the use of dopamine to prevent renal dysfunction in indomethacin-treated preterm infants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>If further studies are to be performed, major clinical outcomes should be addressed and enough patients should be enrolled to ensure that serious complications of therapy can be detected. </P>
