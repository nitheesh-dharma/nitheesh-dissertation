<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is not enough evidence to show that lowering body temperature can reduce nerve damage during coronary artery bypass surgery.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>For people with severe coronary artery (heart) disease, bypass surgery can be life saving. However, bypass surgery is sometimes associated with neurological complications, where very occasionally patients may suffer a stroke, or more commonly memory or personality may be affected. The temperature used during bypass surgery may influence these adverse effects. Reducing the temperature during surgery (hypothermia) may protect the brain and reduce the risk of complications. The review of trials found that there was not enough evidence to show the protective effects of hypothermia. More research is needed. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be life saving, but known side effects include neurological damage and cognitive impairment. The temperature used during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may be important with regard to these adverse outcomes, where hypothermia is used as a means of neuroprotection. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of hypothermia during CABG in reducing neurological damage and subsequent cognitive deficits. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) and this was updated by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE to December 1999 using database specific RCT filters. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched and experts in the field were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only RCTs were considered. All patients undergoing CABG, either first time or revisions, elective or emergency procedures, were included. Any hypothermia protocol was considered. Only trials reporting neurological outcomes were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were selected independently and data were extracted from the source papers independently by two reviewers. Authors were contacted for further information. Studies were combined with meta-analysis where appropriate, and meta-regression was used to explore heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There was a trend towards a reduction in the incidence of non fatal strokes in the hypothermic group (OR 0.68 (0.43, 1.05)). Conversely, there was a trend for the number of non stroke related perioperative deaths to be higher in the hypothermic group (OR 1.46 (0.9, 2.37)). There was no evidence to suggest that hypothermia had an effect on the incidence of non fatal myocardial infarction (OR 1.05 (0.81, 1.37)), but the incidence of another marker of myocardial damage, low output syndrome, was higher in the hypothermic group (OR 1.21 (0.99, 1.48). When pooling all "bad" outcomes (stroke, perioperative death, myocardial infarction, low output syndrome, intra aortic balloon pump use) there was no significant advantage of either hypothermia or normothermia (OR 1.07 (0.92, 1.24)). Only 4 of 17 trials reported neuropsychological function as an outcome. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review could find no definite advantage of hypothermia over normothermia in the incidence of clinical events. Hypothermia was associated with a reduced stroke rate, but this is off set by a trend towards an increase in non stroke related perioperative mortality and myocardial damage. There is insufficient data to date to draw any conclusions about the use of mild hypothermia. Similarly, there is insufficient data to date to comment on the effect of temperature during CPB on subtle neurological deficits, and further trials are needed in these areas. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Coronary artery by-pass surgery or grafting (CABG) may be life-saving in patients with severe coronary artery disease, but may also result in neurological damage and cognitive impairment. Although the incidence of gross neurological events following CABG is fairly low, with the incidence of stroke between 0.5-2% (<LINK REF="REF-Javid-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javid 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gilman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilman 1990</LINK>), more subtle neuropsychological impairment after CABG has been reported in between 15-80% patients and as high as 100% in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Hammeke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammeke 1988</LINK>). Whilst survival is of obvious value, neurological damage and subsequent cognitive impairment may have devastating consequences on patients' emotional, occupational and social life. Relatively little attention has been paid to these sequelae, and the British Cardiac Patients Association have indicated that a review in this area is a priority. </P>
<P>Early reports suggested that clinical brain damage following CABG was relatively rare (<LINK REF="REF-Gersh-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersh 1983</LINK>). Recently, more subtle neurological deficits have been reported following CABG, where measurable deficits are present in almost half of patients at one week, with a third of patients showing deficits at 2 months post surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Toner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toner 1998</LINK>). Most studies report an improvement in cognitive deficits with increasing time post surgery, possibly due to reversibility of injury, although the possibility of familiarization with the tests has been debated (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1990</LINK>). Although neurological deficits are often transient, affected individuals are more likely to show signs of early dementia at 5 years post surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sotaniemi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sotaniemi 1986</LINK>). Small cerebral ischemic lesions have been detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following CABG, but the clinical significance of these is debated (<LINK REF="REF-Vanninen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanninen 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Neurological damage associated with CABG may occur through a number of different mechanisms. First, many patients with coronary artery disease may also have cerebrovascular disease and CABG may trigger an acute cerebrovascular accident or stroke. Second, the method and duration of mechanical by-pass may cause micro-emboli to develop which may result in cerebral emboli, insufficient cerebral blood flow, focal ischemia and neurological damage sufficient to cause cognitive impairment. Third, cognitive impairment may be due to depressive illness associated with coronary artery disease, or following CABG. This review however is not concerned with the psychiatric sequelae of CABG.</P>
<P>Specific interventions to reduce the risk of neurological damage and cognitive impairment following CABG have been developed and fall into 4 major groups:</P>
<P>1) Degree of hypothermia and warming during CABG (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craver 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>2) Mechanical interventions to reduce micro-emboli in by-pass machines (<LINK REF="REF-Hessel-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hessel 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henze-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henze 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sellman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taggart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taggart 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toner 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>3) Anaesthetic and pharmacological strategies to maintain cerebral perfusion and neuroprotection (<LINK REF="REF-Fish-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fish 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bashein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaidan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaidan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gold-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>4) Maintenance of physiological homeostasis during surgery through control of acid-base balance, substrate load and glucose management (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engelhardt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelhardt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review will focus on the degree of hypothermia and warming during CABG on neurological outcome and cognitive function. Normothermia during coronary bypass surgery has been shown to be an important risk factor for stroke (Odds Ratio 4.85) (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1995</LINK>). Hypothermia may provide cerebral protection by reducing cerebral oxygen consumption, and decreasing the risk of cerebral ischaemia due to cerebral emboli as a result of lower cerebral blood flow requirements. </P>
<P>Whilst we are primarily interested in the effects of systemic temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurological protection, the mode of delivery of cardioplegia to the heart during surgery may also affect embolic load (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>). Several myocardial protection strategies have been developed using cardioplegia of different temperatures, composition, and different modes of delivery to the heart, either retrograde or antegrade, continuous or intermittent. We will also examine markers of myocardial damage, as there may be a trade off between myocardial protection and neurological protection. </P>
<P>A previous review of neurological outcomes and cardiopulmonary temperature has been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Christakis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christakis 1995</LINK>). The authors could not find any advantage of hypothermia versus normothermia during CABG in terms of both the incidence of strokes and deficits in neuropsychological function. However, this review was not formally systematic in its coverage, included some non-randomized studies, and several randomized controlled trials have been published since this time. Consequently, an up to date systematic review is indicated.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>From the searches, the title and abstract of each paper was reviewed by one reviewer and potentially relevant references retrieved. Following this initial screening, two reviewers independently selected trials to be included in this review using predetermined inclusion criteria. In all cases disagreements about any study inclusions were resolved by consensus. Study outcome data were extracted independently by two reviewers, and chief investigators of trials were contacted to provide additional relevant information where necessary. In addition to study outcome data, trial quality was assessed independently in terms of concealment of allocation, losses to follow up, blind assessment of outcomes, and adequacy of control. Data concerning patient characteristics; age, sex, urgent versus elective CABG, and details of the CABG procedure, the mode of cardioplegia delivery, and bypass time, were also collected as stated a priori to perform stratified analysis of the data using meta-regression.<BR/>Dichotomous outcomes for each study have been expressed as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous variables have been expressed as the mean change from baseline to follow up, and the standard deviation difference from baseline to follow up for each comparison group. Where standard deviation differences have not been reported in the source papers, allowance has been made for within patient correlation from baseline to follow up measurements by using the correlation coefficient between the two (see Cochrane Heart Group web site for details and, <LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). A weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI have been calculated for each study. Data from each study were pooled as appropriate using a fixed effect model, except where substantial heterogeneity existed according to the Z statistic, and a random effects model was used (where a random effects model was used this is indicated in parentheses). </P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>See also included studies table.<BR/>A clear and adequate method of randomization was reported in 11/19 studies. Three of 19 studies reported inadequate randomization in that group allocation was alternate, or based on hospital numbers. Sensitivity analyses have been performed excluding these studies and the results are presented below. Blinding of outcome assessors was considered to be important for those studies with neurological examination or psychometric testing as an outcome, rather than those just reporting clinical events. Four of 6 studies reported blinding of outcome assessors. Losses to follow up did not occur in most studies which report clinical events in the short term. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Heyer" TYPE="STUDY">Heyer</LINK>) reported very high losses to follow up for late psychometric testing at 6-9 weeks post surgery, and these data have not been included in the review. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>From the searching, 19 studies reporting separate trials were identified which met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 studies reported hypothermia and normothermia as the primary comparison groups, 4 studies reported the effects of hypothermia, mild hypothermia or tepid temperature and normothermia, and 2 studies hypothermia and tepid temperature. Outcome variables were assessed for the comparison groups hypothermia and normothermia as per groupings in the individual trials, and separately for hypothermia and tepid temperature. <BR/>Individual trials recruited patients of very similar mean ages (mean 60.9 years, range across trials 57-65), and the majority of participants were men (84% men, range across trials 74-98%). Most trials excluded patients with neurological deficits. The case mix of patients across trials were relatively low risk patients with the exception of one trial that recruited only patients with left ventricular dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Rashid-B" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid B</LINK>). Most patients across trials underwent elective CABG (mean 14.3% urgent operations, range 0-59%), with the exception of one trial where the number of urgent cases exceeded the number of elective cases (<LINK REF="STD-Engleman-cold" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman cold</LINK>).<BR/>Clinical outcome variables were assessed only over the short term within 30 days of the operation. </P>
<P>Clinical events<BR/>Hypothermia vs normothermia<BR/>The pooled effect estimate showed a reduction in the incidence of non fatal perioperative strokes in the hypothermic group (OR 0.68 (0.43, 1.05)), although this failed to reach statistical significance. Conversely, there was a non significant trend for the number of non stroke related perioperative deaths to be higher in the hypothermic group (OR 1.46 (0.9, 2.37)). Hypothermia had no effect on the incidence of perioperative non fatal myocardial infarction (OR 1.05 (0.81, 1.37)). Data were also collected on another more sensitive marker of myocardial damage, low output syndrome (LOS), which is described as the occurrence of persistent clinically threatening hypotension, and defined as a requirement for intra-aortic balloon pump support, or prolonged use of inotropes postoperatively to maintain systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. The incidence of low output syndrome in the hypothermic group was higher than in the normothermic group (OR 1.21 (0.99, 1.48). Paradoxically, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was higher in the normothermic group (OR 0.67 (0.44, 1.03)). When pooling all "bad" outcomes (stroke, perioperative death, MI, LOS, IABP) there was no significant advantage of either hypothermia or normothermia (OR 1.07 (0.92, 1.24)).</P>
<P>Hypothermia vs tepid temperature<BR/>Only 5 studies reported non fatal stroke as an outcome. Moderate hypothermia had no effect on the incidence of perioperative non fatal stroke (OR 0.94 (0.33, 2.73)), perioperative death (OR 1.94 (0.39, 9.66)), or non fatal MI (OR 0.68 (0.26, 1.81)) compared to mild hypothermia or tepid temperature.</P>
<P>Psychometric testing to assess cognitive function<BR/>Hypothermia vs normothermia<BR/>Of the 17 studies in this comparison group, only 4 reported neuropsychological function as an outcome measure. Each trial used a number of different psychometric tests. Tests have been broadly divided into those measuring intellectual IQ function, memory, motor skill or dexterity, and executive function. Those trials which have used the same tests have been pooled to determine effect size. Subsets of tests have not been pooled as they often measure different things and respond differently across different age groups. This is particularly true for the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak</LINK>). A qualitative overview of all of the psychometric tests used in these trials are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Results for both the quantitative and qualitative analysis have been divided into early tests (within 1 week of the operation) and late tests (1-3 months post operatively) as reported in the source papers. <BR/>For tests of intellectual IQ function and memory, higher scores indicate improved performance, so where mean changes from baseline to follow up are negative, this indicates a deterioration in performance. The opposite is true for all tests of motor skill/dexterity and executive function where higher scores show a deterioration in performance, therefore a mean change from baseline to follow up which is negative should be interpreted as an improvement in performance. For these reasons, the sign of the mean change in intellectual IQ function and memory has been changed for the pooled analysis so the direction of effect is in the appropriate direction.<BR/>No significant neuroprotective effects of hypothermia were seen for any of the early psychometric tests (within 1 week post op) in the quantitative analysis, although the numbers of trials in each comparison group were small. Similarly, no significant effects of hypothermia were seen for the late psychometric tests (1-3 months post op). The qualitative analysis shows variable responses to different tests for different trials (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for early and late tests respectively). Most tests of cognitive function show deterioration immediately post operatively which is present in either group, or both groups to a similar extent. Conversely, for the late tests, most trials show an improvement in cognitive function from baseline to follow up, again individual trials showing variable responses of hypothermia and normothermia. </P>
<P>Neurological examination<BR/>Five trials in the hypothermia vs normothermia group reported neurological examination outcomes using a number of different assessments. The results of these are presented qualitatively in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Deterioration in the Mathew score, and mini mental status score was seen to a similar extent post surgery in both comparison groups in the 2 trials that measured each of these as outcomes. </P>
<P>Psychometric testing and neurological examination in the hypothermia vs tepid temperature group<BR/>Two trials in this group reported psychometric testing, one for early tests within 1 week of surgery, and one for late tests at 6 weeks post surgery. Results are presented qualitatively in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Again, variable responses were seen between hypothermia and tepid temperature for each of the tests.<BR/>Neurological examination was reported in 3 trials in this group and results are presented qualitatively in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Deterioration in the Mathew score was seen 3-4 days post surgery in one trial to a similar extent in both groups. The mini mental status score was unchanged in either group in another trial from baseline to 6 days post surgery.</P>
<P>Health related quality of life<BR/>None of the trials reported health related quality of life as an outcome.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>Sensitivity analyses excluding trials of low methodological quality, where randomisation was inadequately performed by allocation of patients on the basis of odd and even hospital numbers, or alternating patients to treatment group, had no effect on the pooled effect estimate for non fatal strokes (OR 0.65 (0.41, 1.05). Sensitivity analysis excluding studies where the systemic temperature is similar in both treatment groups has no effect on the pooled effect estimate for non-fatal strokes (OR 0.66 (0.42, 1.02)).</P>
<P>Stratified analysis<BR/>Subgroup analysis was performed to examine the effects of the method of cardioplegia delivery (either retrograde or antegrade) on the incidence of non fatal stroke. No significant advantage was seen with either method, although there were relatively few studies in each comparison group (retrograde cardioplegia, random effects model OR 0.68 (0.28, 1.62), antegrade cardioplegia OR 0.84 (0.44, 1.61)). This subgroup analysis was also carried out for the outcome perioperative deaths where similarly there was no significant advantage seen with either method (retrograde cardioplegia OR 1.31 (0.56, 3.11), antegrade cardioplegia OR 1.6 (0.87, 2.95)).<BR/>Heterogeneity was further explored with the use of meta regression. Co-variates defined a priori included retrograde or antegrade delivery of cardioplegia as a dichotomous variable, bypass time and percentage of patients undergoing urgent rather than elective surgery. The method of delivery of cardioplegia, or the percentage of urgent cases within each trial did not significantly affect the number of non-fatal strokes. The odds ratio for non-fatal strokes was however significantly affected by the mean time on bypass. The odds ratio for non-fatal stroke is multiplied by a factor of 1.03 per minute increase in bypass time (coefficient log OR 0.0297, (CI 0.00387, 0.0555), p=0.024), thus the number of non-fatal stokes increases with increasing time on bypass.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The findings from this systematic review using the current trial evidence cannot demonstrate any clear advantage of either hypothermic or normothermic CPB in the occurrence of clinical events. There is a non significant trend towards fewer strokes in the hypothermic group, but this is counterbalanced by a trend towards higher perioperative mortality and myocardial damage as shown by the data on low output syndrome. Conversely, there were no differences between the groups in the occurrence of MI, possibly because this is regarded as a relatively crude marker for myocardial damage. When we examine the pooled "bad" outcomes (including stroke, perioperative death, MI, LOS and IABP use) there is no difference in the summary effect estimate between hypothermia and normothermia.</P>
<P>Individual trials differ in both systemic and cardioplegic temperatures, and the mode of delivery of cardioplegia. These differences, particularly the mode of cardioplegia delivery, either retrograde or antegrade, continuous or intermittent, may affect the embolic load (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>). Cold cardioplegia was originally used to maintain cardiac arrest during surgery, and to minimise ischaemic damage. More recently "warm heart surgery" proposed to be more beneficial in myocardial protection has been introduced whereby the temperature of the cardioplegia is maintained at 37 degrees and cardiac arrest during surgery is maintained by the potassium concentration in the cardioplegia rather than by hypothermia. Systemic temperatures reflect those of the CPB perfusate, and patients may be actively warmed, actively cooled or allowed to drift towards mild hypothermia, depending on the protocol. Retrograde delivery of the cardioplegia via the coronary sinus prevents distal embolization of coronary or graft debris, and is recommended for redo CABG, and for tight coronary stenoses (<LINK REF="REF-Loop-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loop 1992</LINK>). Cardioplegia can be distributed to the myocardium regardless of the state of the native vessels, and flooding of the operative field is reduced, allowing more continuous flow. Retrograde cardioplegia has also been reported to result in a higher incidence of emboli immediately after release of the aortic cross clamp compared with antegrade cardioplegia (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1995</LINK>). Antegrade delivery of cardioplegia is accomplished via the ascending aorta. Flow is necessarily limited in myocardial regions served by severely occluded coronary arteries.</P>
<P>In an attempt to determine the effects of retrograde or antegrade delivery of cardioplegia on the incidence of stroke, we have performed subgroup analyses, and meta regression. No significant advantage of either method was seen, although the number of trials in each group were small. Similarly, meta regression failed to show a relationship between effect size and mode of cardioplegia delivery. The systemic temperature rather than cardioplegia temperature is more important in terms of neuroprotection. The group allocation to hypothermia or normothermia in all but 2 trials reflected the systemic temperature rather than cardioplegia temperature. Sensitivity analyses excluding these trials had little effect on the summary effect estimate for non fatal strokes.</P>
<P>The clinical event data contributing to the current meta-analysis is dominated by 2 multi centre RCTs, the study from Emory (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-_x0028_Emory_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Martin (Emory)</LINK>) and the Warm Heart Investigators in Toronto (<LINK REF="STD-Warm-Heart" TYPE="STUDY">Warm Heart</LINK>). To date, these are the only RCTs of warm versus cold surgery of sufficient power to detect possible differences in the stroke rate. The warm heart investigators found no difference in the rate of strokes or MI, less frequent low output syndrome, and a trend towards reduced perioperative mortality in the normothermic versus hypothermic groups. Conversely, the Emory series found no relative advantages of normothermia, but a significantly increased stroke rate which lead to early termination of the study. A number of factors may explain these opposing results, particularly the operative technique and the patient population. The Emory trial used continuous retrograde warm blood cardioplegia versus intermittent cold oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia. Patients were actively warmed or cooled to maintain systemic normothermia or hypothermia respectively. The total number of adverse neurological events were 1.4% in the cold group, and 4.5% in the warm group. Multivariate analysis was used to determine predictors of stoke in this group of patients. Preoperative congestive heart failure, age, aortic cross clamp time and use of warm retrograde cardioplegia were all significantly associated with stroke. Differences in the stroke rate were non existent in patients under 60, twice as likely in the warm blood patients between the ages of 60-69, and five times as high in warm blood patients over the age of 70 (<LINK REF="REF-Guyton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyton 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the warm heart investigators trial there were fewer women (16% vs 25%), fewer patients over the age of 70 (16% vs 30%), and fewer higher risk patients for re operations (14% vs 4%). Differences in the patient populations alone may explain the higher incidence of strokes in the Emory series. However, cardioplegia in both the warm and cold blood groups was primarily antegrade (94% of patients) in the warm heart investigators trial, whereas in the Emory trial patients received warm retrograde continuous cardioplegia. Warm patients in the warm heart investigators trial were not actively warmed to maintain systemic normothermia as in the Emory series, but rather allowed to drift to 33 degrees, so it is possible that a significant proportion of patients in this group were mildly hypothermic. Small differences in systemic temperature may affect the susceptibility of the brain to cerebral emboli due to differences in metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow.</P>
<P>In response to the different results found with normothermic CPB, tepid or mild hypothermic CPB has been proposed as a possible compromise. Only 5 trials totaling nearly 500 patients reported stroke as an outcome in this group, so there was insufficient power to detect differences between groups. </P>
<P>Across all trials, meta regression was used to examine the effects of cardioplegia delivery as mentioned previously, but also the number of urgent rather than elective procedures, and bypass time on the incidence of strokes. The effect size was unrelated to the mode of cardioplegia delivery, or the number of urgent procedures. Mean bypass time was however associated with the incidence of strokes, where the number of strokes increases with increasing time on bypass. This finding is however based on mean trial data rather than individual patient data and should be interpreted with caution. Other potentially important co-variates include variability in co-interventions and operative techniques, volumes and flow rates of cardioplegia, individual patient systemic temperatures, and surgeon specific outcomes. </P>
<P>Subtle neurological deficits detected by neurological examination or psychometric testing, and quality of life measures, have been considered important outcomes of CABG with the reduction in stroke rates over the years. Unfortunately very few trials reported these as outcomes, and in those that did, several different measures/scales were used which makes interpretation of findings between trials difficult. None of the trials included in this review reported quality of life as an outcome. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review could find no definite advantage of hypothermia over normothermia in the incidence of clinical events. Hypothermia was associated with a reduced stroke rate, but this is off set by a trend towards an increase in perioperative mortality and myocardial damage. There is insufficient trial evidence to date to draw any conclusions about the use of tepid CPB. Similarly, no conclusions can be made concerning the effect of temperature on more subtle neurological deficits due to lack of data. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To date only 2 trials included within this review are of sufficient power to detect differences in the stroke rate between hypothermia and normothermia. Differences in operative techniques and patient population may explain the contradictions found between these 2 trials. Further trials are required of standard format to resolve some of these discrepancies, perhaps with the use of tepid CPB given the high stroke rate reported in the Emory series. There is insufficient data to date to comment on the effect of temperature during CPB on subtle neurological deficits and further trials are needed in this area. Similarly, health related quality of life which is an important outcome has not been reported in any trial to date, and future trials should address this. </P>
