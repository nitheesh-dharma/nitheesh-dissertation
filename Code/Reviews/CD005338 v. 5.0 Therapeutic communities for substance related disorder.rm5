</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Therapeutic communities (TCs) are a popular treatment for the rehabilitation of drug users in the USA and Europe. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of TC versus other treatments for substance dependents, and to investigate whether effectiveness is modified by client or treatment characteristics.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psycinfo, CINAHL, SIGLE from their inception to March 2004. Reference lists of studies were scanned.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing TC with other treatments, no treatment or another TC.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently inspected abstracts, the methodological quality was assessed using Drug and Alcohol CRG checklist. When possible, data were summarised using relative risks and differences in means, otherwise results are presented as reported by authors. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies were included. Differences between studies precluded any pooling of data, results are summarised for each trial individually: TC versus community residence: no significant differences for treatment completion; Residential versus day TC: attrition (first two weeks), and abstinence rates at six months significantly lower in the residential treatment group; Standard TC versus enhanced abbreviated TC: number of employed higher in standard TC RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.63, 0.96). Three months versus six months programme within modified TC, and six months versus 12 months programme within standard TC: completion rate higher in the three months programme and retention rate (40 days) significantly greater with the 12 months than 6 months programme. <BR/>Two trials evaluated TCs within a prison setting: one reported significantly fewer re incarcerated 12 months after release from prison in the TC group compared with no treatment, RR 0.68 (95% CI 057, 0.81). In the other, people treated in prison with TC compared with Mental Health Treatment Programmes showed significantly fewer re incarcerations RR 0.28 (95% CI 0.13, 0.63), criminal activity 0.69 (95% CI 0.52, 0.93) and alcohol and drug offences 0.62 (95% CI 0.43, 0.90) 12 months after release from prison. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is little evidence that TCs offer significant benefits in comparison with other residential treatment, or that one type of TC is better than another. Prison TC may be better than prison on it's own or Mental Health Treatment Programmes to prevent re-offending post-release for in-mates. However, methodological limitations of the studies may have introduced bias and firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to limitations of the existing evidence.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-27 17:05:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Drug and alcohol misuse and dependence has become a substantial world-wide public health problem. Drug misuse and addiction can put the individual at increased risk of a variety of illnesses, for example, there is a danger of infections such as HIV and hepatitis amongst injectors. In the UK from 1985 to 1995 there was marked increase in drug related deaths amongst young people 15 to 19 years (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>). Heroin addicts have a mortality risk almost 12 times greater than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 1994</LINK>), and mortality from self-poisoning with opiates has increased over nine-fold in the past two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Needleman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needleman 1997</LINK>). Many drug users support their drug taking with significant criminal activity which is costly and damaging to the individual and society as a whole. The high morbidity and mortality associated with drug misuse makes it important that people have contact with treatment services. </P>
<P>Treatment of drug addiction can roughly be divided into two steps: detoxification from addiction and maintenance of abstinence. One of the most serious limits to long-term maintenance of abstinence is relapse after successful detoxification. Harm reduction treatments, for those who are not yet able to achieve a drug free state, may help to reduce the risks associated with the use of street drugs. Relapse from the drug-free state to re-addiction is a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of dependent drug users. Treatment options for people who are addicted to illicit drugs include: a combination of behavioral therapies and medications such as methadone or buprenorphine, detoxification, intensive outpatient treatment and residential treatment. A number of Cochrane systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials reporting the effectiveness of treatments for opiate dependence exist: (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2003a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2003b</LINK>). These reviews highlight that methadone maintenance at proper doses is the most effective treatment in retaining patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use but shows weak evidence of effectiveness towards other relevant outcomes such as mortality, criminal activity and quality of life.</P>
<P>Therapeutic communities (TC) for the treatment of drug misuse and addiction were introduced in the 1960s. TCs are drug-free residential settings that use a hierarchical model of care. Treatment stages reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility. Peer influence is used to help individuals learn to assimilate social norms and develop more effective social skills. The way they differ from other treatment approaches is through the use of 'the community' as the key agent of change. The community here meaning both staff and others receiving treatment. Another fundamental principle of TCs is 'self-help', meaning that the individuals themselves are the main contributor to the process of change. TCs treat people with a range of substance misuse problems. People referred often have multiple drug addictions, mental health problems, inadequate family and social support and involvement with the criminal justice system.</P>
<P>While TCs are generally considered, particularly in the USA and parts of Europe, to be an effective method of rehabilitating abusers of drugs, the bulk of the research evidence is from poorly controlled studies (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Etheridge-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etheridge 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-F_x002d_Hermida-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">F-Hermida 2002</LINK>). In the last decade, a number of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of TCs have been conducted. Although there are a number of narrative reviews summarising the therapeutic community literature, they have a number of methodological shortcomings, and to date the evidence from RCTs has not been reviewed systematically.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) To summarise the evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic communities compared with other treatment options for reducing drug use for people with substance dependence<BR/>(2) To determine if effectiveness is modified by type of substance misused, reason for treatment attendance (voluntary or court order), prior treatment, treatment setting (in or out-patient) or by the duration of stay in a therapeutic community</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials with parallel group or cluster design. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included a comparison of one type of therapeutic community for substance misuse with a different type of therapeutic community, an alternative form of treatment or with placebo or no treatment. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People who sought treatment or were ordered by the court to obtain treatment with any substance misuse or dependency problem. These included people with a range of substance abuse problems, multiple drug addictions, co-morbidities e.g. mental health problems, and people with prior substance misuse treatment experience.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included RCTs evaluating the following interventions:</P>
<P>
<B>Experimental interventions: </B>therapeutic community <BR/>
<B>Control intervention: </B>pharmacological maintenance treatments, detoxification treatments, psychosocial treatments, placebo or no treatment group and another therapeutic community that differed in duration of treatment or programme of care offered</P>
<P>We excluded RCTs evaluating the effects of an adjunctive intervention given to one group of clients within a therapeutic community, that weren't evaluating the effects of TC directly.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) Illicit drug use measured by self-report or urinalysis during treatment or follow-up<BR/>(2) Alcohol use measured by self-report or urinalysis during treatment or follow-up<BR/>(3) Retention in treatment <BR/>(4) Reasons for withdrawal from treatment<BR/>(5) Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores during treatment or follow-up<BR/>(6) Imprisonment<BR/>(7) Employment<BR/>(8) Drug use arrests <BR/>(9) Overdoses<BR/>(10) Death due to all causes or drug related</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Study Selection</B>
<BR/>All study citations found were collated in a single database. Titles and abstracts were screened by one author (LS) and references potentially relevant to the review were selected and obtained. These included reviews and primary studies. Full reports of citations with inadequate information to definitively determine relevance were also obtained. Two authors (LS &amp; SG) independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded according to the eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by a third author (DF).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of the methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Studies selected for inclusion were appraised for methodological quality using recognised criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>), and quality assessments are discussed in the results. Quality assessment included:</P>
<P>Allocation concealment<BR/>(1) A. adequate allocation concealment; any procedure ensuring adequate concealment of allocation, such as: central randomizations(e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics), pre-numbered or coded identical bottles or containers which are administered serially to participants, drug prepared by the pharmacy, serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable; computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered or other description that contained elements convincing of concealment;<BR/>(2) B. unclear allocation concealment; when the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or report an approach that did not fall in the category A or C.<BR/>(3) C. inadequate allocation concealment; Any procedure not assuring adequate concealment of allocations such as: alternation or reference to case numbers, dates of birth, day of the week. Any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation, such as an open list of random numbers or other description that contained elements convincing of not concealment</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment<BR/>It was decided a priori that it was unlikely that participants and investigators would be blinded to treatment assignment. However, it was possible that the trial would include a blind outcome assessment, therefore, this was the only blinding criterion that was assessed and rated as:<BR/>(1) yes<BR/>(2) no<BR/>(3) unclear</P>
<P>Completeness of follow-up was evaluated by recording the following aspects:<BR/>(1) Method of analysis - Intention to treat or per-protocol<BR/>(2) Method of imputation used for missing data<BR/>(3) Proportion of participants completing the full follow-up period</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Data were extracted from included studies, using a ProForma designed for this review, by two authors (ALS &amp; SG) independently. Disparities were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>Data extracted included:<BR/>Details of participants including demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), primary drug used, duration of abuse and co-morbid conditions<BR/>Detailed description of therapy in active and control groups, duration, frequency and compliance<BR/>Outcome measures and results<BR/>Study design<BR/>Numbers randomised and analysed for each outcome<BR/>Withdrawals and dropouts</P>
<P>Data for intention-to-treat analyses were extracted if presented. If participants had not been analysed in their randomised groups they would be restored to the correct group for the review if sufficient information was reported to allow this. There were no reports of clients analysed in the wrong group. </P>
<P>The corresponding author of each study were contacted by e-mail for missing information about study methods and outcomes that were described inadequately in the published report. To date, two authors have responded and provided additional information.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>Meta-analyses and investigations of heterogeneity were not conducted as there were no two studies similar enough to combine. Treatment effects were expressed as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and differences in means (MD) for continuous outcomes, and reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) when sufficient data for their calculation were reported. When this was not possible, summary statistics as presented in the individual study reports are reported in this review.</P>

<P>Included studies<BR/>We included ten reports of seven RCTs in the review. The types of intervention and comparisons are listed below and detailed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1999</LINK> reported on an evaluation of the Amity prison TC for male inmates that volunteered for substance abuse treatment. Volunteers with at least nine to fourteen months until parole, were selected at random, as beds became available, to enter the prison TC. The waiting list control group consisted of sample in-mates with less than nine months left to serve. Also, about 10% of the control group consisted of in-mates that were ineligible to join the study sample due to technical reasons e.g. less than nine months left to serve. Treatment within the TC followed a three phase process: orientation lasting two to three months; treatment lasting five to six months; and re-entry lasting one to three months. In-mates randomly assigned to the prison TC were invited to join a community-based TC for up to a year following their release from prison. The control group were released directly into the community.</P>
<P>In the study described by <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2004a</LINK>, male inmates with a co-morbid serious mental illness and substance misuse were randomly assigned to a modified therapeutic community (MTC) or Mental Health Treatment Programmes (MH). Treatment in the MTC was attendance of formal activities five days a week for four to five hours a day, the rest of the time was spent on prison work. A cognitive-behavioural programme with a foundation of TC principles was followed. The aim was to change attitudes and lifestyles in relation to, substance abuse, mental illness and criminal behaviour and thinking. Treatment in the MH was based on intensified psychiatric services including medication, individual therapy, and counseling and specialised group sessions. On release from prison, MTC inmates could enter an MTC after-care programme.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Condelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Condelli 2000</LINK> reported on a study conducted on The New Jersey Substance Abuse Treatment Campus, USA. The campus provides services needed by underserved populations, the aim is to reduce costs by centralising services, sharing facilities and therefore serving large numbers of clients. Substance abusers were randomised to therapeutic community (long term 6-12 months) or chemical dependency (short term 28 days) programmes on the campus. Chemical dependency programmes followed 12-step with greater emphasis on discharge planning and aftercare arrangements. The therapeutic communities followed a traditional regimen, modified for women in the women only programmes and for Hispanics in the Spanish speaking programmes. Each client was eligible for treatment in a sub-set of programmes, and as a minimum was eligible for at least two programmes, one short term and one long term. Other programme features affecting eligibility were language spoken (English or Spanish) and whether the programme was for women only or co-gender.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guydish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guydish 1998</LINK> conducted a study where clients entering a TC-oriented drug treatment programme were randomly assigned to day or residential conditions. The TC was based on the family model. The structure of treatment started with an orientation phase in the first month, followed by a treatment phase lasting three to six months where the emphasis was on treatment of drug abuse and associated social and psychological problems. The re-entry phase, lasting three to six months, was focused on supporting the client in making independent employment and living arrangements. During the final phase, clients were no longer resident but participated in group and individual therapy on an outpatient schedule. The day treatment programme operated from a.m. to p.m., Monday to Friday, with reduced hours on weekends. Clients were required to attend seven days a week in the first month and five days per week thereafter. Whilst drug use while in treatment resulted in expulsion from the residential programme, a temporary relapse was tolerated for clients in the day programme. Following randomisation to treatment groups, there was a two week waiting period before entering the research protocol.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McCusker-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">McCusker 1997a</LINK> reported on two RCTs conducted concurrently in New England, USA. One compared a short planned duration of treatment (six months) with a longer planned duration of treatment (12 months) within a traditional therapeutic community, and the other compared a short planned duration of treatment (three months) with a longer planned duration of treatment (six months) within a modified therapeutic community incorporating a relapse prevention and health education programme.</P>
<P>In the study described by <LINK REF="STD-Nemes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nemes 1999</LINK>, drug abusing clients were assigned to one of two 12 month therapeutic community programmes which differed in their lengths of inpatient and outpatient treatment. The standard programme offered 10 months inpatient treatment followed by two months outpatient services, and the abbreviated programme offered six months inpatient treatment followed by six months outpatient services. The study was conducted in Washington DC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nuttbrok-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nuttbrok 1998</LINK> evaluated homeless, mentally ill chemical abusers assigned to a therapeutic community or a community residence (CR). Both treatment settings were enhanced to provide treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, whilst keeping the different treatment philosophies of the two settings intact. The TC was of the traditional type, the CRs were characterised as low demand environments where relapses are tolerated and therefore may be considered as less strict than the TC.</P>

<P>All included studies were stated as randomised, few gave further details about how the randomisation schedule was generated or if allocation to treatment groups was concealed. There were concerns about the adequacy of the randomisation procedures in several studies. <LINK REF="STD-Condelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Condelli 2000</LINK> used a computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by native language, gender and pregnancy, but at times some assignments may have been non-random due to limited bed availability. <LINK REF="STD-Guydish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guydish 1998</LINK> used a systematic method to allocate participants to treatment groups by the use of odd/even numbers sealed in envelopes. The use of odd/even numbers means that it is unlikely that the assignments were concealed. The randomisation method was not described by <LINK REF="STD-Nuttbrok-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nuttbrok 1998</LINK>, however, the treatment facilities had the final say over acceptance of assigned clients post-randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1999</LINK> selected people at random from a pool of eligible inmates, and assigned them to prison TC as beds became available. Non-randomly selected inmates joined a no treatment control group when the had less than nine months remaining from parole. About 10% of the control group were inmates with less than nine months to parole at the study beginning, therefore were ineligible for TC assignment. <LINK REF="STD-McCusker-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">McCusker 1997a</LINK> in the relapse prevention trial state that they used block sizes of 21 to assign clients to groups or an elapse of 30 days.

<P>Attrition of randomised clients was a particular problem in all trials. This occurred at two different stages: one was after randomisation but before actual start of treatment, particularly as there was often a delay before treatment started. <LINK REF="STD-Condelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Condelli 2000</LINK> defined their ITT population as people randomised and accepted for treatment, which excluded people who failed to show up to complete the admission appointment (27%), and people referred elsewhere or not accepted due to medical or legal reasons (3%). The authors justified their definition of this modified ITT population by stating that the losses between randomisation and a bed becoming available should be random, as assignment was concealed, and losses were similar between groups with no baseline imbalances created.<LINK REF="STD-Guydish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guydish 1998</LINK> excluded 5% due to protocol violations, and <LINK REF="STD-McCusker-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">McCusker 1997a</LINK> stated that they conducted an ITT analysis, but it was unclear if 61 clients excluded from analyses due to treatment refusal and not completing baseline assessment were originally randomised or were eligible but not randomised. For all three studies the groups to which the excluded clients were randomised was not reported, and these clients were excluded from analyses reported by the authors. <LINK REF="STD-Nuttbrok-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nuttbrok 1998</LINK> also reported severe early attrition, almost 50% either were rejected by the facility as being not suitable for treatment or failed to show up for treatment after randomisation. Therefore, clients remaining may be considered to be a select group. <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1999</LINK> followed up all clients 12 months after release.</P>
<P>Another stage of attrition was during the duration of the trial, after treatment had started. Most studies didn't conduct ITT analyses, but analysed those completing treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Nemes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nemes 1999</LINK> stated that 93% of their clients were followed up, but analyses are presented for clients able to provide the appropriate outcome data only, i.e. only clients not in prison were analysed for employment outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2004a</LINK> excluded 51 clients from all analyses due treatment crossover, 50 of which were randomised to MTC. They defined their ITT sample as completers and drop-outs minus crossovers, but all clients were not accounted for at follow-up and there were still exclusions. <LINK REF="STD-McCusker-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">McCusker 1997a</LINK>- states they conducted an ITT for primary analyses, survival analyses were conducted with losses censored and losses assumed to be treatment failures, but it is unclear how many were randomised to each group, 93% clients were followed up after study completion. <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1999</LINK> followed up all clients 12 months post-release.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is little evidence to show that TCs offer significant benefits in comparison with other residential treatment, or that one type of TC is better than another in terms of drug use related outcomes and retention in treatment. Prison TC may be better than prison on it's own or Mental Health Treatment Programmes to prevent re-offending post-release for male in-mates. However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to limitations of the existing evidence.</P>
<P>Overall, few comparisons showed significant differences between one treatment and another. And for each comparison, there was only one study, therefore these results should be interpreted in light of lack of replication. Nonetheless, some differences were shown. Homeless, MICA clients assigned to TC, were significantly more likely to have a negative urine screen than clients assigned to a community residence. There were no significant differences in retention in treatment. Significantly fewer inmates assigned to prison TC were re incarcerated at 12 months post release compared with prison inmates receiving no treatment or assigned to alternative services. One study reported significantly fewer people completing at least 25 days of treatment in a TC compared with chemical dependency. For residential TC versus day TC, attrition during the first two weeks was significantly lower, however there was little difference at longer follow up periods, abstinence at six months was also significantly higher, but no different at longer follow-up periods. There were no significant differences in ASI scores. The only outcome showing significant benefit for enhanced abbreviated TC versus standard TC was employment. For TCs of different durations of treatment, longer duration of treatment was associated with better outcomes, but few were significant differences. </P>
<P>The data were surprisingly sparse, given the popularity of TCs particularly in the USA. No studies were found that were conducted in Europe. Unfortunately, the one study we found that compared a TC with a methadone maintenance programme, did not meet our eligibility criteria as the randomisation procedure had been seriously compromised <LINK REF="STD-Bale-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Bale 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bale-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bale 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bale-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bale 1984</LINK>.</P>
<P>A potential source of bias in the studies was the high level of treatment refusals and drop-outs following randomisation that occurred before treatment started. These clients were lost from further analyses in almost all of the studies which seriously compromise the validity of the results of these trials. Particularly as the rate was often high, and differed between treatment groups. Surprisingly, demographic characteristics of clients at baseline in most studies were balanced. Authors cited the difficult population as the reason for the high drop-out and difficulty with randomisation. Further attrition, that wasn't always fully accounted for in the analyses, occurred during the duration of treatment. Most studies analysed data for treatment completers only. </P>
<P>Only a few studies reported results for follow-up after treatment exit, and this was often compromised by high levels of attrition. The effectiveness of these interventions after treatment completion is of interest. Drug use using a subjective outcome measure, ASI, was evaluated in some studies. A more reliable method of measuring drug use would be an objective measure such as urinalysis, however, this raises logistical problems and may contribute to missing data. Another problem with outcomes that were evaluated using symptom scores was the analysis of data only on treatment completers, and it was not clear how missing data were handled. It wasn't clear how many people were analysed in treatment groups for some measures, and in others only people remaining in the trial were analysed. </P>
<P>Generally, reporting of the included studies was poor and failed to meet the standards recommended in the CONSORT statement (www.consortstatement.org). Few studies reported how important aspects of study design were conducted, such as concealment of treatment allocation and handling of missing data, making it difficult to assess the risk of bias. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of therapeutic communities for treatment of drug misuse and dependency is not based on sound evidence of effectiveness. The evidence is not of high quality and is therefore not conclusive. The cost-effectiveness is unknown. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials are justified as there is insufficient evidence to establish whether TCs are more effective at reducing drug use and health and social outcomes associated with drug use in comparison with an alternative treatment. In particular comparison with methadone maintenance programmes. Future trials should be designed with the aim to minimise attrition at the early stages of trial, following randomisation and before treatment starts. A large pragmatic study would be helpful, evaluating objective outcomes that can be followed up for everyone randomised to minimise missing data. The use of time to event outcomes to retain all participants in the analyses at follow-up should be considered. A pragmatic study that retains everyone in the analysis would help to answer clinically relevant questions such as: if someone is assigned to a TC, what proportion are for example, drug free or crime free not just during treatment but also after discharge. Given the cost of a specialist treatment such as TC, evaluating cost-effectiveness is essential. Many hypotheses have been generated from the observational research in this area that warrants further exploration using more rigorous methodology. Future trial reports should be fully reported according to CONSORT guidelines.</P>
