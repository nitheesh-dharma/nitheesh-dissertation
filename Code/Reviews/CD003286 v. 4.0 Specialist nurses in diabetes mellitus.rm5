<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Specialist diabetes nurses provide education and support services to people with diabetes in many health care systems. A key goal is helping enable people to self-manage their diabetes. However, this review of trials found no strong evidence of benefit of care from specialist diabetes nurses for adolescents and adults with diabetes. Although short-term benefits may be possible, this has not been shown to result in long-term improvements. People receiving care from diabetes nurses do not appear to have improved health when compared with usual care in hospital clinics or primary care with no specialist nursing input. No data were shown on quality of life measures. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:21:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The patient with diabetes has many different learning needs relating to diet, monitoring, and treatments. In many health care systems specialist nurses provide much of these needs, usually aiming to empower patients to self-manage their diabetes. The present review aims to assess the effects of the involvement of specialist nurse care on outcomes for people with diabetes, compared to usual care in hospital clinics or primary care with no input from specialist nurses. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of diabetes specialist nurses / nurse case manager in diabetes on the metabolic control of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:21:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We carried out a comprehensive search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify trials. Bibliographies of relevant papers were searched, and hand searching of relevant publications was undertaken to identify additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of the effects of a specialist nurse practitioner on short and long term diabetic outcomes were included in the review. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three investigators performed data extraction and quality scoring independently; any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials including 1382 participants followed for six to 12 months were included. Two trials were in adolescents. Due to substantial heterogeneity between trials a meta-analysis was not performed. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the intervention groups was not found to be significantly different from the control groups over a 12 month follow up period. One study demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c in the presence of the diabetes specialist nurse/nurse case manager at 6 months. Significant differences in episodes of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia between intervention and control groups were found in one trial. Where reported, emergency admissions and quality of life were not found to be significantly different between groups. No information was found regarding BMI, mortality, long term diabetic complications, adverse effects, or costs. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The presence of a diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager may improve patients' diabetic control over short time periods, but from currently available trials the effects over longer periods of time are not evident. There were no significant differences overall in hypoglycaemic episodes, hyperglycaemic incidents, or hospital admissions. Quality of life was not shown to be affected by input from a diabetes specialist nurse/nurse case manager.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Education of the patient with diabetes</HEADING>
<P>Treatment goals of diabetes are avoidance of late diabetic complications, normalisation of blood glucose levels and to enable people with diabetes to achieve a good health related quality of life. The patient with diabetes has to cope with many issues regarding the chronic disease, its control and complications. Education is not only required in the first few months following diagnosis, but is also a necessary component of their care throughout, and should be adjusted to the patient's own individual needs. Therefore, behavioural modifications require long-term information, education and care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager</HEADING>
<P>Specialist nurses are defined as 'a registered nurse, who, after a significant period of experience in a specialised field of nursing and with additional nursing education, is authorised to practice as a specialist with advanced expertise in a clinical specialty to involve in clinical practice, consultation, teaching and research' (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1993</LINK>). Specialist nurses may or may not have a formal qualification in diabetes care. In addition, the specialist diabetes nurse will also be defined as a nurse who works wholly in diabetes care, based in either the hospital or community, including domiciliary visits, and crossing the boundaries between the two.</P>
<P>Nurse case managers will be defined as registered nurses who are certified diabetes educators and trained to follow a set of detailed management algorithms specific to diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many areas of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, specialist nurses provide much of the education and support given to patients with diabetes in both community and acute hospital settings. However, variations in health care, both within and between countries (<LINK REF="REF-Felton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felton 1997</LINK>) mean that whilst some patients gain access to the specialist nurses, others do not. This variation largely depends upon the accessibility of funds and the preference of individual clinicians. The present review aims to assess the effects of specialist nurse care; which includes education of people with diabetes, the provision of ongoing advice on controlling diabetes, advice on dealing with intercurrent illnesses, advice/supervision of initiation of treatment(s), and advice about learning to live with the diagnosis of diabetes, in comparison to no intervention from a specialist nurse. The review recognises that nurses act within complex health care systems and are often part of a broader package of care. The review attempts to identify other possible influencing variables within each included trial, and in addition included studies in which the service of a specialist nurse is added to an existing diabetes service which otherwise did not change. Only nurse interventions at individual patient level were included. Education in groups were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The role of the diabetes specialist nurse</HEADING>
<P>Diabetes is a complex condition, and has effects on many aspects of peoples lives. The specialist nurse is typically involved in co-ordinating the ongoing care of patients, educating and counselling, but also providing advice on medication and management of intercurrent illness.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Education</HEADING>
<P>Education is probably the most important role of the specialist nurse, with a large amount of information regarding the disease, its control and life style changes, needing to be imparted over a prolonged period of time. Increasing the patient's understanding of the disease through education can prevent or delay the onset of complications and reduce the number of hospitalisations, and as such is the key to improving the quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Diab-education-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diab education 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Counselling</HEADING>
<P>Alongside the role of educator, the specialist nurse also provides a counselling role (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1988</LINK>). In addition to learning new practical skills, the patients have to take on the implications of a life-long disease, and may need help in accepting the changes which are occurring in their lives. The specialist nurse is in a unique position in that a relationship between patient and nurse will be maintained over a long period of time, and can provide support and time for patients as part of their role.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disease management</HEADING>
<P>The specialist nurse may also make adjustments to a patient's treatment regimen, for example insulin dosage. Nurses may also advise patients on the management of intercurrent illnesses, in particular advising on diabetic treatments during other illnesses. This enables a broader approach to patient management.</P>
<P>The non-educational roles of the diabetes specialist nurse may increase the effectiveness of education.</P>
<P>Diabetes information given to patients at any time needs to be up-to-date and consistent to reduce possible confusion caused by conflicting advice. Throughout the course of the disease patients are likely to come into contact with a number of health professionals, such as dieticians, primary care physicians, nurses, chiropodists, and the specialist nurse has a role in maintaining the professional knowledge of these people. Similarly the specialist nurse has a responsibility to ensure that the position of other health care professionals are not undermined by the advent of specialist nurses. Other roles of the specialist nurse are in research, and advising on local policies (<LINK REF="REF-Grzebalski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grzebalski 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The role of the nurse case manager</HEADING>
<P>In the USA, diabetes self management education is performed by a range of health care professionals such as nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, exercise specialists, doctors and social workers who have become 'Certified Diabetes Educators', (<LINK REF="REF-Felton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felton 1997</LINK>). Their role in the care of patients with diabetes will reflect only some of those of the specialist nurse. In particular, they are much less likely to make adjustments to treatments regimens, or advise on intercurrent illnesses. Similarly, education of other health care professionals, and coordination of the patients care are not undertaken by the diabetes educator (<LINK REF="REF-AADE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AADE 2001</LINK>). However, some nurse diabetes educators, have also been trained to be nurse case managers. Their role is similar to that of the specialist nurse, for example they can make adjustments to treatments following a set of management algorithms (Aubert 1998). Therefore, nurse case managers are included in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Integration into health care systems</HEADING>
<P>In the UK, the British Diabetic Association report of 1985 recommended that each health district, serving 200,000 people, should have a minimum of two diabetes specialist nurses. This was increased to four per 250,000 people in 1991. Current practice levels have not always met this recommendation and an Audit Commission Study showed that only two of nine study sites audited met these recommended standards (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Comm.-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Comm. 2000</LINK>). Recommendations from the Royal College of Nurses in the UK are that specialists nurses are paid at least at a level of a ward sister (<LINK REF="REF-RCN-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 1991</LINK>), with many in more senior positions. Costs of these posts are potentially offset by savings made from reduced inpatient treatments for acute complications of diabetes, such as hypo- or hyperglycaemia, and treatment of chronic complications such as diabetic foot ulcers. Savings may also be made from increasing compliance in patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of specialist nurses</HEADING>
<P>Evidence of the effectiveness of diabetes specialist nurses is at present unclear. Patients in contact with specialist nurses are generally satisfied with the level of care that they receive (<LINK REF="REF-Gafvels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gafvels 1996</LINK>) and it is thought that patients often contact the specialist nurses in preference to their general practices. The impression is that this is because the specialist nurses can provide better information and advice than general practice staff. However, measurement of outcomes of receiving care from a specialist nurse has not been reviewed in a systematic way. Thus a review of the evidence of the benefits and effectiveness of the nurse specialist is required.</P>
<P>The primary purpose of this review was to assess the evidence base for specialist nurses in general. However, in recent years there has been some sub-specialisation, particularly in the UK, with separation of nursing care for children and adults. This is not universally accepted, and a secondary aim was to see if there is any evidence to support the splitting of specialist nursing care into adult and paediatric groups.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-01 19:39:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin deficiency leads to chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. There are various types of diabetes mellitus of differing etiology. The most common types are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (SRGs)').

<P>Two independent observers (EL, PR) reviewed titles, abstracts and keywords of all records retrieved. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment if the information given suggested that the study: 1. included patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2. compared specialist nurse intervention with no specialist nurse intervention, or paediatric nurse intervention to standard specialist nurse intervention, in which it was required that the intervention was evaluating the nurse alone (i.e. not a team approach), where education was individually based, and where nurses had responsibility for adjusting treatment regimens, 3. assessed one or more of the defined outcome measures. Full articles were also retrieved for clarification, when there was doubt about eligibility. Interrater agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>). In cases of disagreement a judgement was made based upon discussion with a third independent reviewer (NW).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-01 19:18:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Assessment of the quality of reporting of each trial was based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995b</LINK>).<BR/>In particular the following factors were studied:<BR/>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals properly described? b) was analysis by intention to treat?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (see Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A: All quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B: One or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C: One or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Each trial was assessed independently by two assessors (EL, NW). Interrater agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>). In cases of disagreement an assessment was made by a third independent assessor (PR) and then judgement was made based on consensus referring back to the original article.</P>
<P>As the number of trials identified was low, we included controlled clinical (non randomised) trials, and used the following quality criteria (<LINK REF="REF-CRD" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD</LINK>): Were the groups similar at baseline in terms of prognostic factors? Were the eligibility criteria specified? Were outcome assessors blinded to the treatment allocation? Were the point estimates and measure of variability presented for the primary outcome measure? Did the analyses include an intention to treat analysis? Were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? Were participants likely to be representative of the intended population?</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 1382 participants were included in the six trials. The individual study sample size ranged from 73 to 585. Participants gender was approximately distributed equally, except in the <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK> study which was of a group of veterans, the majority of whom were male. Gender was not reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2001</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Couper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Couper 1999</LINK>) were in adolescents, with mean ages of 13 and 14 years respectively. Mean ages in the adult trials ranged from between 45 and 61 years. Participants of one trial were members of American Indian and Alaskan Native ethnic groups (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2001</LINK>). The type of diabetes was noted in only one of the adult trials and was reported to be type 1 diabetes in approximately half of this population. Duration of diabetes was reported in only three trials, with the range of mean duration of diabetes in the adolescent trials being 4 - 8 years and in the adult trial from 14-19 years (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Couper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Couper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) was the diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager directly responsible for the alteration of treatment regimens, in others the nurse made a recommendation for treatment change. Whilst it cannot be clearly determined whether the physician has acted on these recommendations; this is often likely to be the case. For this reason these studies were included in the review.</P>
<P>In the two adolescent trials, a nurse case management approach was used, and in both cases some use was made of electronic communication such as telephone contact. In one of these trials nurses, together with the patients, set individual goals for frequency of blood glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment according to target blood glucose levels (<LINK REF="STD-Couper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Couper 1999</LINK>). These participants also received weekly phone calls from the nurse. In the <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK> trial the adolescents used a glucometer with a modem which transmitted data from self monitoring of blood glucose to the hospital every two weeks. The nurse practitioners then suggested follow up care by telephone using an algorithm for regimen adjustments, referrals and advice.</P>
<P>In two of the adult trials a nurse case management approach was combined with automated telephone calls in which structured messages were relayed to patients, and where patients could report blood glucose levels, symptoms and self-care (<LINK REF="STD-Piette-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK>). Telephone contact with the nurse was made following reports generated by the automated telephone calls, and nurses also made periodic calls. Patients in the intervention groups could also receive automated self-care calls. Nurses in these studies were unable to suggest alterations to treatments directly, rather recommended dosage adjustments to the primary care physician.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK> trial, the nurses also made use of telephone communication; patients were given individualised telephone contacts in which adjustments to treatments were recommended. The <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2001</LINK> trial supplemented diabetes care with a nurse care coordinator who provided direct alterations in the patients care, and suggested alterations in medication to the primary care physician. In all trials the control interventions was 'usual care' which included contact with the physician and other members of the multidisciplinary team as necessary.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review describes five randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial studying the effects of a diabetes specialist nurse or nurse case manager on people with diabetes. All of the trials examined glycated haemoglobin, a measure of long term blood glucose control, as an endpoint. Despite there being an improvement in glycaemic control in the intervention groups of many of the trials reviewed, HbA1c in the intervention groups was not found to be significantly different from the control groups over a 12 month follow up period. One study demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c in the intervention group when compared to the control group at six month. In sub-groups of patients with higher baseline levels of HbA1c, a significant difference was observed between the intervention and control groups at 12 months, with the intervention groups having better metabolic control. Similarly, the proportion of participants with a greater than 10% drop in HbA1c was statistically significantly different between groups. Other outcomes such as hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic episodes were not found to be different as a result of the intervention and were generally poorly reported.</P>
<P>From currently available trials the effects of a diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager does not appear to be strong over longer periods of time. Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish from the reporting in many of the trials how long the interventions were undertaken for. In general the quality of the trials included in this review was not good. Only two of the included trials described their method of allocation concealment, and despite the proportion of drop outs ranging from 5 to 35% across the trials, only two trials carried out an intention to treat analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological considerations and limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>The diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager is an example of a complex intervention (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2000</LINK>) in that their role involves several components, which makes it difficult to establish with any precision which is their active ingredient. This has presented us with a number of difficulties in their evaluation. In all included trials it was important to establish that as far as possible it was only the presence of the nurse that was different between the two groups. Despite this, it is difficult to establish with any degree of certainty that any effects shown were attributable to that presence alone.</P>
<P>The eligibility criteria of the studies were diverse. For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK> study all patients were on a hypoglycaemic agent whereas in the <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK> study all were on insulin. Similarly, of the two studies of adolescents, one included only those with a mean glycated haemoglobin of more than 9% (<LINK REF="STD-Couper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Couper 1999</LINK>). The entry levels of the outcomes were also different in all studies, with no trials reporting change scores, which leads to difficulties with standardisation. Pooling of data were therefore deemed to be inappropriate due to the profound heterogeneity between trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Of the six trials included, the interventions evaluated varied greatly, as can be seen in Table 1. Some evidence of an effect of the presence of a specialist nurse was evident at six months, but the findings were greatly reduced beyond this time. This is somewhat similar to observations made in reviews of patient education in other chronic diseases and may be due to few trials assessing outcomes beyond the 6 month period (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2001</LINK>). However, in all but one trial reported in this review, the follow up period was at least 12 months. The quality of the trials was generally low and this leads to difficulties in assessing the implications for practice. No implications for practice can be drawn from available data. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The present evidence base is unsatisfactory. Future research might firstly take the form of an observational study in several countries to identify the roles and time allocation of diabetes specialist nurses / nurse case managers, since roles vary even within countries. Secondly, qualitative research looking at the relative educational impact of educators alone versus educators (such as the diabetes specialist nurse) who are also involved in clinical care would be useful, that is do diabetes specialist nurses / nurse case managers have greater educational effect because of their wider role? Thirdly, a randomised controlled trial of specialist nurse intervention should be performed. Because of the rising prevalence of diabetes, many health care systems are under considerable financial pressures. Future research should include an economic component, perhaps in the form of cost per quality adjusted life year.</P>

<P>INTERVENTION: Glucometer with memory and modem used. All self monitoring of blood glucose data transmitted every data from home to hospital every 2 weeks. Data reviewed by paediatric nurse practitioners. Frequency of follow-up used an age-appropriate algorithm based on data. If mean blood glucose within normal range, a postcard sent. If not, then telephone contact made - discussed possible regimen adjustments, need for a clinic visit or referral to dietitian, social worker or physical therapist. All insulin adjustments made by nurse practitioners using dose-adjusted algorithms, designed to achieve mean weekly blood glucose levels &lt;141mg/dL and no more than 2 asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes per week. Also attended the clinic for routine care every 3 months.<BR/>CONTROL: Standard Care. Clinic visits every 3 months. Used the same monitoring but without modem.

<P>INTERVENTION: Automated telephone system : Structured messages of recorded statements and queries bi-weekly to determine patients health, with a 5-8 min. assessment. Patients reported self monitoring of blood glucose readings, self-care, perceived glycemic control and symptoms of poor glycemic control. Interacted with system using touch-tone keypad. Also given option to participate in interactive self-education. After several months offered additional automated self-care education calls. A Spanish language version of the automated calls provided.<BR/>- Telephone nurse follow-up: each week nurse used reports generated by automated telephone system to prioritise patient contacts with follow-up calls - nurse adressed problems reported during assessments and provided more self-care education. Nurse also made periodic calls to follow-up on issues discussed in a prior week, or check on those who rarely responded to calls. Depending on problem, nurse contacted the primary care physician. Nurse did not have ability to authorise medication changes, but recommended dosage adjustment to primary care physician.<BR/>CONTROL: Usual care: Patients had no systematic monitoring between clinic visits or reminders of upcoming clinic appointments. Follow-up visits at providers discretion. Additional visits at patients initiative. Nurse contact over the telephone, diabetes education clinic and interpreter service available.<BR/>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: 12 months</P>
