<TITLE>Garlic for peripheral arterial occlusive disease affecting the legs</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-15 09:44:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The most common symptom of peripheral arterial occlusive disease is intermittent claudication, discomfort in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest. The underlying cause is atherosclerosis. Risk factors associated with the development of peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, raised blood cholesterol and other fats (lipids), high blood pressure and diabetes. Garlic has been used as a medicinal therapy since ancient times. The main active ingredient is an unstable odorous sulphurous compound called allicin so that active ingredients may be lost in processing, and with different types of preparation. Commercially available preparations of garlic are reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors for vascular disease. With fresh garlic, at least seven cloves of garlic per day are needed. Apart from the odour, garlic has only minor gastrointestinal side effects.</P>
<P>The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature and found one controlled trial in which 78 participants with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were randomised to receive garlic or a placebo medication. The dose of garlic was two coated tablets of 200 mg oral standardised garlic powder twice daily. Both men and women, aged 40 to 75 years, were included although sixteen did not keep to their treatment.<BR/>
<BR/>After twelve weeks of treatment, pain-free walking distance increased similarly whether receiving garlic or placebo. Similarly there was no difference in the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and pressure differences between the ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed although more people taking garlic (28%) than placebo (12%) complained of a noticeable garlic smell. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a long-term (chronic) condition and any improvements in symptoms would require longer-term treatment and follow up than in this study.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-15 09:46:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:58:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Peripheral arterial occlusive disease primarily affects the major arteries of the lower limb. The most common symptom in early occlusive disease is intermittent claudication - discomfort in the legs induced by exercise and relieved by rest. Numerous risk factors have been associated with the development of peripheral arterial disease, including cigarette smoking, raised blood lipids, hypertension and diabetes.</P>
<P>The medicinal use of garlic can be traced back to Egyptian times. The primary active component of garlic is an unstable odorous sulphurous compound called allicin. Meta-analysis of commercially available preparations of garlic have been reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors associated with atherosclerosis such as serum cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Silagy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silagy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warshafsky-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warshafsky 1993</LINK>). With fresh garlic, the dosages needed to inhibit platelet aggregation or lower cholesterol levels are unacceptably high; at least seven cloves of garlic per day (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Garlic is an acceptable therapy to the general population and, apart from the odour, has only minor gastrointestinal side effects. Trials with endpoints more meaningful and relevant than laboratory endpoints, however, are necessary before claiming that garlic improves health. Many trials have been carried out to assess its efficacy in the treatment and risk reduction of coronary atherosclerosis, but few trials have been carried out in people with peripheral vascular disease.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to assess the efficacy of garlic therapy in improving the morbidity associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The relevant trials of garlic have been considered. As one of the difficulties in showing the effectiveness of garlic is that active ingredients may be lost in processing, the type of preparation (i.e. fresh, powdered or non-powdered) has been taken into consideration.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To establish the effectiveness of garlic in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive diseases. </P>
<P>We wished to test the following hypotheses:</P>
<P>a) That commercially prepared garlic preparations have a beneficial effect on the morbidity associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease;</P>
<P>b) That the magnitude of the effects observed with dried garlic is greater than with non-powder preparations in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:59:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>We assessed randomised controlled trials of garlic versus placebo for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. As there are currently only a few trials in this area, any trials identified in future that either use alternation (e.g. allocation by date of birth or days of the week) or that have not been analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (as long as all randomised patients were accounted for) will be included. Blinding of participants is a particular problem in garlic trials because of its characteristic smell.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 15:00:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>People with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were included. Most participants had intermittent claudication (diagnosed either by questionnaire or clinically), but those with critical limb ischaemia and asymptomatic disease identified by testing (angiography, ankle pressures, etc.) were also eligible.</P>
<P>People with aortic disease and no peripheral arterial disease were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any trial of garlic therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease was considered. Since one of the difficulties in showing the effectiveness of garlic is that active ingredients may be lost in processing, the type of preparation (i.e. fresh, powdered or non-powdered) was taken into consideration.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Two main outcome measures were considered: objective measures of progression of underlying atherosclerosis (e.g. ankle pressure measurements, treadmill testing, angiography); and subjective measures (e.g. symptom progression).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 15:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Keisewetter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Keisewetter 1993</LINK>) was randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled. There was no mention of the method of randomisation, nor the concealment of allocation (score B). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate, but the trial was of short duration (only 12 weeks). No intention-to-treat analysis was used for the sixteen patients who did not complete the study.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 15:08:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The weighted mean difference and a fixed-effect model were used to test the significance of the results. The mean difference between the two groups at the end of treatment was analysed rather than the mean change within the two groups before and after treatment. After twelve weeks of treatment, pain-free walking distance increased from 161 to 207 metres in the garlic group and from 172 to 203 metres in the placebo group. There was no difference in change of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed but nine patients taking garlic (28%) and four patients taking placebo complained of a noticeable garlic smell (12%). No studies were found comparing dried garlic with non-powder preparations.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The only included study was small and of short duration (12 weeks). Although no statistically significant improvement was found overall, the authors of the trial report that there was a significant increase in walking distance, but this only occurred in the last weeks of therapy. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a chronic condition, and any subjective or objective improvement in outcomes would require longer term therapy and follow up.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>One small trial of short duration found no statistically significant effect on walking distance. Thus, at this stage, garlic as a therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease cannot be recommended.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials of garlic therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease are required to determine its effectiveness. These trials should be large and of reasonable duration.</P>
