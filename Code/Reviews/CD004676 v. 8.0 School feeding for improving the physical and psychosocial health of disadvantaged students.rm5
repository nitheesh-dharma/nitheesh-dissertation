<P>Early malnutrition and/or micronutrient deficiencies can negatively affect many aspects of child health and development. School feeding programs are designed to provide food to hungry children and to improve their physical, mental and psychosocial health. This is the first systematic review on the topic of school feeding. Eighteen studies were included in this review; nine were performed in higher income countries and nine in lower income countries. In the highest quality studies (randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from low income countries, children who were fed at school gained an average of 0.39 kg more than controls over 19 months; in lower quality studies (controlled before and after trials (CBAs)), the difference in gain was 0.71 kg over 11.3 months. Children who were fed at school attended school more frequently than those in control groups; this finding translated to an average increase of 4 to 6 days a year per child. For educational and cognitive outcomes, children who were fed at school gained more than controls on math achievement, and on some short-term cognitive tasks.Results from higher income countries were mixed, but generally positive. For height, results from lower income countries were mixed; in RCTs, differences in gains were important only for younger children, but results from the CBAs were large and significant overall. Results for height from high Income countries were mixed, but generally positive. School meals may have small physical and psychosocial benefits for disadvantaged pupils. We recommend that further well-designed studies on the effectiveness of school meals be undertaken, that results should be reported according to the socio-economic status of the children who take part in them, and that researchers gather robust data on outcomes that directly reflect effects on physical, social, and psychological health.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Early malnutrition and/or micronutrient deficiencies can adversely affect physical, mental, and social aspects of child health. School feeding programs are designed to improve attendance, achievement, growth, and other health outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective was to determine the effectiveness of school feeding programs in improving physical and psychosocial health for disadvantaged school pupils .</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched a number of databases including CENTRAL (2006 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1980 to May 2006) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2006). Grey literature sources were also searched. Reference lists of included studies and key journals were handsearched and we also contacted selected experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) were included. Feeding had to be done in school; the majority of participants had to be socio-economically disadvantaged.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed all searches and retrieved studies. Data extraction was done by one of four reviewers and reviewed by a second. Two reviewers independently rated quality. If sufficient data were available, they were synthesized using random effects meta-analysis, adjusting for clustering if needed. Analyses were performed separately for RCTs and CBAs and for higher and lower income countries.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 18 studies. For weight, in the RCTs and CBAs from Lower Income Countries, experimental group children gained an average of 0.39 kg (95% C.I: 0.11 to 0.67) over an average of 19 months and 0.71 kg (95% C.I.: 0.48 to 0.95) over 11.3 months respectively. Results for weight were mixed in higher income countries. For height, results were mixed; height gain was greater for younger children. Attendance in lower income countries was higher in experimental groups than in controls; our results show an average increase of 4 to 6 days a year. Math gains were consistently higher for experimental groups in lower income countries; in CBAs, the Standardized Mean Difference was 0.66 (95% C.I. = 0.13 to 1.18). In short-term studies, small improvements in some cognitive tasks were found.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>School meals may have some small benefits for disadvantaged children. We recommend further well-designed studies on the effectiveness of school meals be undertaken, that results should be reported according to socio-economic status, and that researchers gather robust data on both processes and carefully chosen outcomes.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 20:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The world has entered the new millennium inheriting an impressive legacy in health from the 20th century. Life expectancy in most countries has reached a new high and infant mortality a new low (<LINK REF="REF-PHAC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHAC 1999</LINK>). However, these averages obscure the fact that health is unevenly and unfairly distributed according to socio-economic position; health and longevity are highest for the richest, and decrease steadily with decreasing income (<LINK REF="REF-PHAC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHAC 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1996</LINK>). These social gradients in health, or socio-economic inequalities in health, are pervasive in all countries of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Diderichsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diderichsen 2001</LINK>) and are evident in most diseases, injuries, and health behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Marchand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchand 1998</LINK>). Health inequalities have been defined as "the virtually universal phenomenon of variation in health indicators ... associated with socio-economic status" (<LINK REF="REF-Last-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Last 1995</LINK>); inequalities may also be seen between different sexes or geographic groups. Health inequalities require three components for calculation: a valid measure of health status, a measure of social position or status, and a statistical method for summarizing the magnitude of the health differences between people in different social positions. Health inequities 'are unfair and remediable inequalities' (<LINK REF="REF-Tan_x002d_Torres-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan-Torres 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2001</LINK>). Thus, health inequalities are measurable, while health inequities require a value judgment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The rationale for school feeding programs </HEADING>
<P>According to Wynn (<LINK REF="REF-Wynn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wynn 1987</LINK>) socio-economic differences in nutrition may be one of the most important factors causing socio-economic differences in health and mortality. Global estimates suggest that, in the period 2000-2002, over 852 million people across the world were undernourished (<LINK REF="REF-FAO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO 2004</LINK>). Many of these were children. Most of these were in developing countries, but even in the United States, more than 3 million children experienced 'food insecurity with hunger' in the period between 1998 and 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2002</LINK>). Early malnutrition and/or micronutrient deficiencies can adversely affect physical, mental, and social aspects of child health. Effects on physical health may include underweight, stunted growth, lowered immunity, and mortality. Early malnutrition and/or micronutrient deficiencies have been linked to poorer cognitive functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Scrimshaw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scrimshaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worobey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worobey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leslie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leslie 1990</LINK>). Short-term hunger can adversely affect attention and interest (Wilson 1983, cited in <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Read-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 1973</LINK>). Overnight and morning fasting (e.g. skipping breakfast) has been shown to adversely affect performance on cognitive tasks, particularly for children who are nutritionally at risk (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 20:53:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>School feeding programs may help to ameliorate some of these problems. The goals of school feeding programs differ, but often include relieving short-term hunger (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2001</LINK>), improving micronutrient status (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2001</LINK>), growth (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>), cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>) and academic performance (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>) in both higher and lower-income countries. Worldwide, 115 million primary school aged children were 'out of school' in 2001/2002; most were from developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNESCO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNESCO 2005</LINK>) Therefore, in developing countries, school feeding also aims to increase school attendance and enrolment (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>) and to encourage students to stay in school longer. Agricultural and community development may be secondary outcomes in developing countries if locally grown food is used (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, there is some controversy over the effectiveness of school feeding programs. According to the World Food Program "Research and experience show that when food is provided at school, hunger is immediately alleviated, and school attendance often doubles within one year" (<LINK REF="REF-WFB-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WFB 2005a</LINK>). However, experts at a School Feeding/Food for Education Stakeholders meeting in 2000 concluded that there is little evidence for nutritional benefits of school feeding and that school feeding only enhances learning when other improvements in school quality are made (World Bank n.d.). Macintyre argued that school feeding programs address a symptom, rather than the root causes of hunger and that they may be stigmatizing (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>One important concern in school feeding studies is that, in poor families, the home diet may be reduced for children who are receiving food at school: this is termed 'substitution'. For example, a survey on school feeding in Malawi showed that 77% of children reported that they get less food at home when they receive school meals. This is substantiated by caregivers; 82% of caregivers reported that substitution was occurring. When there is extra food, it is used to benefit other household members, particularly children (<LINK REF="REF-Galloway-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galloway 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rationale for this review</HEADING>
<P>Many countries have school feeding programs. For example, in 2004 the World Food Program alone had school feeding programs in 72 countries, covering 16.6 million school children (<LINK REF="REF-WFP-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WFP 2005b</LINK>). A great deal of money is invested in these programs. Yet, to date there has been no formal systematic review of the effectiveness of school feeding programs across the world. It is therefore important to learn whether or not this is an effective and cost-effective intervention for improving the health, nutritional status, school enrolment and school performance of disadvantaged children.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to assess the effectiveness of school meal programs for improving the health of socio-economically disadvantaged children. Another purpose is to study their effectiveness in terms of equity: are they benefiting those children who are more disadvantaged children at least as much as those who are more advantaged?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Previous non-systematic reviews </HEADING>
<P>We have thus far been unable to identify an existing systematic review on the effectiveness of school feeding programs. However, we have identified some non-systematic reviews of school feeding programs (<LINK REF="REF-Grantham_x002d_McGregor-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantham-McGregor 05</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papamandjaris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papamandjaris 2000</LINK>), and reviews of supplementary feeding programs for children (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickie-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickie 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some conclusions from these reviews are that: 1) the largest effects of feeding in early childhood on growth are likely to be found between the ages of 6 and 24 or 36 months, 2) growth may not be as important as other outcomes such as improved physical and psychological health (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK>), 3) the brain is sensitive to short-term lack of nutrients and that this may be particularly problematic for children who are undernourished (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>), 4) morning feeding might produce emotional benefits, enhance ability to work (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1978</LINK>), lead to 'transient' improvements in cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Grantham_x002d_McGregor-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantham-McGregor 05</LINK>) and improve classroom behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Papamandjaris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papamandjaris 2000</LINK>) if classrooms are well set up (<LINK REF="REF-Grantham_x002d_McGregor-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantham-McGregor 05</LINK>), 5) school-feeding programs may increase attendance (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>), particularly in rural low income schools in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>), 6) many studies covered in the early reviews were poorly done (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>), 7) outside factors such as home environment seemed to have at least as much effect as school feeding; greater improvement might be achieved if both diet and the environments in which children lived and learned were improved, (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>) and,8) evidence is mixed (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Although the above reviews provided valuable information, they fail to give us a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness of school feeding across the globe. All were limited in their scope: some to just a few countries, most to either developing or industrialized countries, others to one feeding time (e.g. morning), and others to just a few outcomes. Furthermore, none were systematic reviews. Thus, standard methods were not used; details on search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of studies found and considered, and quality of studies was not formally assessed. Importantly, little formal synthesis has been done.</P>

<P>Children and adolescents, in any country, aged 5 to 19, who attended primary or high school. Note that this age range represents a change from the published protocol, which was focused solely on elementary school children. In the review, elementary and high school children were both included due to the dearth of studies on high school students.<BR/>Based on the 2004 World Bank List of Economies (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2005</LINK>), countries were classified into two groups: 1) Low and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMIC) and 2) Higher income countries (Upper-Middle and Higher-income countries). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were somewhat different for these two groups. These criteria represent a modification of the published protocol; this was necessary in order to be more precise.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Lower Income countries</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Included: </HEADING>
<P>Those studies in which children were classified as 'predominantly disadvantaged' by one or more of the following criteria: 1) Living in a rural area or village; 2) Living in an urban area and described as socio-economically disadvantaged (e.g. poor or low-income) or from poor areas (e.g. slums); 3) if statistics were presented showing that 30% of more of the children in the sample were underweight, or stunted (nutritionist judgement) or that the average weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were low (nutritionist judgement) and 4) studies were implicitly or explicitly aimed at disadvantaged children, and indicators of disadvantage were provided in the paper.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2 Excluded: </HEADING>
<P>Studies were excluded if: 1) children were from urban areas only with a large proportion of high socio-economic status (SES) children and results could not be broken out by SES or other proxy variables; or 2) where information was insufficient to allow us to judge the extent of disadvantage.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Included: </HEADING>
<P>Those in which children were classified as disadvantaged by the following criteria: 1) they were from areas described as economically marginalized or disadvantaged (e.g. Low income area, ghetto, social housing projects, from mining communities); 2) they were described as low SES (e.g. working class) 3) more than half were from lower SES groups (including unemployed parents); 4) they were described as marginalized or "at-risk'' due to social circumstances.</P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Included: Meals (breakfast or lunch) or snacks (including milk) administered in a school setting. If a study included two or more experimental groups given different types of meals, we chose the meals with the highest energy and/or protein content for data extraction and analysis. </P>
<P>Excluded interventions: micronutrient supplementation or fortification of existing meals, stand-alone nutrition education in schools or at home, obesity prevention programs, breastfeeding programs, food stamps, modifications to school meals to change nutrient content, community kitchens, food banks, and feeding centres. </P>
<P>Because of the increasing emphasis on reducing obesity in higher-income countries, programs built around school meals in these countries increasingly aim to enhance the nutritional content of children's diets by increasing availability and access to low-fat choices, fruits, and vegetables (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luepker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luepker 1996</LINK>). However, the focus of this review is not on changing content of school meals, but rather on studying the effect of provision of food to children. Thus, these types of interventions are not part of this review.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We extracted data on changes in the intervention group relative to the control/comparison group. </P>
<P>Physical health outcomes included nutritional status (anthropometry, bone mineral density, bone mineral content, micronutrient status, and haemoglobin, and hematocrit). Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are indices of anaemia, a condition in which the blood cannot carry enough oxygen, and most often due to iron deficiency.</P>
<P>Psychological health outcomes included educational outcomes (e.g., school achievement in math, reading, or spelling, school enrolment, school attendance) and other tests of cognition such as intelligence test scores, psychomotor and mental development, attention, memory, reasoning, verbal fluency, vocabulary, on-task behaviour.</P>
<P>Behavioural outcomes included on-task behaviour, attention problems, and behaviour problems. </P>
<P>Adverse outcomes included stigmatisation, dependency, disruptive behaviour at school, and obesity or excessive weight loss. </P>
<P>Excluded outcomes: Reduction of dental caries, increased nutritional knowledge, and intermediate physical health outcomes such as reduction of hunger and nutrient intake.</P>

<P>The abstracts and titles of articles retrieved by the electronic and hand searches were independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (EK and VR) and/or one reviewer (EK) and one research assistant (CB), according to the inclusion criteria above.</P>
<P>Full copies of all those deemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers were retrieved for closer examination. Two reviewers (EK and VR) determined whether or not they met eligibility criteria. We sought the advice of BM, JK and TG when we needed input on whether or not the children were disadvantaged.

<P>We developed our data abstraction forms a priori based on the data collection forms from the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) review group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>). They were modified to capture specific items of data needed for this review. These forms were pilot-tested with four included studies to ensure clarity, completeness and ease of use. Data were extracted by one of four reviewers and checked by another reviewer who had not done the original extraction. We extracted data on study design, description of the intervention (including process), details on participants (including age, sex, number in each group), length of intervention, definition of poor/low income, other socio-demographic variables, including place of residence, race/ethnicity, age, and nutritional status, critical appraisal (see below), physical, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes. We had planned to extract data on cost-effectiveness, but found none. Where possible, we recorded effects by socio-economic position.

Quality/acceptability of food given<BR/>8. Duration of intervention<BR/>9. Substitution</P>
<P>
A 2.3. Detail on the Process evaluation
</P>
<P>Contemporary research practice recommends process evaluation alongside empirical trials of complex interventions so as to identify how the intervention was implemented in practice, the mechanism by which it achieved its impact, and any local contextual issues that may have influenced outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calnan 2003</LINK>). Process evaluation can also be undertaken as part of a systematic review, by extracting, analysing and synthesising any data from the included studies that may help explain mechanism(s) of action and/or heterogeneity of outcomes. Thus, when a complex social intervention appears to have had a significant effect in one trial but no effect (or a negative effect) in another, an analysis of the link between the context (as described in the paper), intervention and outcome aims to generate further hypotheses about the circumstances in which this intervention might be more or less successful. To this end, TG reviewed all papers included in the final review in order to identify information on process elements that may have helped to explain the process by which each intervention achieved (or failed to achieve) an impact in each primary study. Descriptive data were extracted from the papers on historical context, local political and economic climate, funding source, extent of involvement and partnership with local researchers, sampling (e.g. how 'disadvantage' was defined and measured), methodological detail of the implementation (e.g. level of supervision during the supplemented meal), context in which growth measurements and psychometric testing were undertaken, and so on. These data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet and used alongside the quantitative findings to help generate the various process hypotheses that are included in the methods, results, and discussion. The process evaluation was particularly helpful in the current review as we lacked sufficient data for meta-regression.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1. Energy content</HEADING>
<P>One important process element was energy content, which was assessed by the nutritionists (BM and JK). Only energy was considered as many studies only provided the average kilocalorie content of the meal/snack, but did not provide sufficient detail regarding the food to estimate other nutrients.<BR/>
<I>2.1.1 Rules used in calculating energy content:</I>
<BR/>1. When the total kilocalories or % Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of energy were provided in the text of the study, this figure was used. When the amount of kilocalories were not provided but the descriptions of food were sufficient (quantity and type of food), the kilocalorie content of the meal/snack was estimated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrient data file.<BR/>2. When meals/snacks with different kilocalorie contents were provided on different days (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK>), a weighted average was taken (e.g. if a meal with 400 kcals was provided 3 days a week and a meal with 600 kcals was provided 2 days a week, then the weighted average of 480 kilocalories was used.<BR/>3. When the number of days on which different meals/snacks were given on was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>) or when the energy content was different in year 1 than year 2 of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>), a straight average was used for the energy content.<BR/>
<I>2.2.2. Calculating % RDA for energy</I>
<BR/>The % RDA for energy was calculated by dividing the given or estimated average kilocalorie content of the meal/snack by the RDA for the age/sex specific target group in each study (SCN 1989). When the intervention group of a study was comprised of various age and sex groups, and outcomes were given for the entire group only, a weighted average for the RDA was used to calculate the % RDA. In addition, as a check, the % RDA was calculated for each age and sex group for which there was a corresponding RDA by dividing the total kilocalories provided by the meal/snack by the age and sex specific RDA. Energy intensity was considered as a continuous variable. However, for purposes of helping to interpret the data, interventions will also be characterized as having two levels of energy content: low (interventions providing &lt;15% of the RDA for energy) and higher (interventions providing 15% or more of the RDA for energy).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Due to lack of information, we were unable to calculate energy content for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shemilt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shemilt 2004</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Continuous data. RCTs, CCTs, and CBAs</HEADING>
<P>To perform meta-analyses of continuous data, we input data on means, standard deviations, and the number of participants for each outcome in the two groups. It is important to note that, in all cases, these means and standard deviations were unadjusted for confounders; however, they were adjusted for clustering when needed. We used mean and standard deviation for change in the meta-analyses in all but one case (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>). In this case, we used end-of-study results for intelligence because we could not find an appropriate Rho (correlations between beginning and end-of-study in the control group).<BR/>In cases where standard deviations and/or standard deviations for change were not published, and the study was published &lt; 30 years ago (after 1976), we wrote to the authors requesting this information. Susan Walker provided us with means and standard deviations for change, and with before and after correlations in the control group for the Powell 1998 study; data from the <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK> study was unavailable. For <LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>, Zhang Qian provided change data for weight and height, corrected for clustering (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>). We received no reply from Agarwal and Paige concerning their respective studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paige-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Paige 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Change data</I>
<BR/>Data on change was either taken directly or calculated from other information presented in the papers for the following studies: Bailey (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1962</LINK>), Baker (Baker 1980 ( boys)) , Corry-Mann (<LINK REF="STD-Corry_x002d_Mann-1926" TYPE="STUDY">Corry-Mann 1926</LINK>), and Devadas (<LINK REF="STD-Devadas1979_x003a_-5_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Devadas1979: 5-6</LINK>). Susan Walker provided data on change and on correlations between the beginning and end-of study for the Powell 1998 study (Walker 2004). These correlations were used in calculating standard deviations for change for the Agarwal (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK> studies, using standard deviation from baseline and end of study according to the methods described in section 8.5.2.10 of the Cochrane Handbook. In cases where data were not meta-analyzed, regression analyses, multilevel analyses, or Analyses of Variance were selected as providing the better estimate of effect, because: a) multilevel analyses accounted for clustering or because b) other ANOVAs and regressions provided results for change.</P>

For all papers except <LINK REF="STD-Corry_x002d_Mann-1926" TYPE="STUDY">Corry-Mann 1926</LINK>, summary statistics were provided rather than the original raw data and we were thus unable to check the raw data for skewness. Furthermore, because change scores were used in most analyses, we were unable to do the rough check described in Section 8.5.2.11 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.5 Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We conducted meta-analysis using a random effects model. Weighted mean differences were calculated unless otherwise stated. We conducted separate analyses for each outcome across: 1) Lower income countries vs. Higher-income country, and 2) Different study designs (i.e. ITS, RCT and CBA). A clinical psychologist (LJ) commented on the clinical relevance of the psychological outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.6 Methods of analysis for studies with potential unit of analysis errors</HEADING>
<P>Studies which allocated by school or class could have unit of analysis errors if they did not adjust for between-cluster correlation. Therefore, we reviewed each primary study to determine whether or not clustering was part of the study design. If it was, we then determined whether or not the analyses adjusted for clustering. If analyses were adjusted in the primary study, we used them.<BR/>
<I>3.6.1. Methods used to correct for design effect in clustered trials or CBAs that were not adjusted for clustering: </I>
<BR/>1. When the pooled estimate used was an SMD (because of varying metrics), the method outlined in section 8.11.2.4 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) was used exactly as described to inflate the standard error. First, we calculated the unadjusted SMD and 95% confidence interval. The unadjusted SMD was entered as the effect estimate in the generic inverse variance method, then we inflated the standard error of the effect estimate by multiplying by the square root of the variance inflation factor, calculated as: (1+ (m-1) multiplied by (ICC), where m is the average cluster size. The standard error was calculated at the confidence interval divided by 3.92.<BR/>2. When the pooled estimate was the WMD approach, we used the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to adjust the standard deviations in the treatment and control groups separately. These standard deviations were then used in the meta-analysis, and so are incorporated in the standard error of the mean difference and the weighting procedures. The result of this is equivalent to the method outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (following the SMD approach) when the variance inflation factors are the same in the treatment and control groups.<BR/>This approach was used because there is a real possibility that the cluster sizes differ between the treatment and control groups and therefore the VIF, which depends on cluster size, would be different. Therefore, the adjustment for variance inflation would differ between the treatment and control groups. As far as we know, the Cochrane Handbook does not provide for this eventuality. However it is necessary to take account of this difference in VIFs (see, for example, Agarwal in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>)).<BR/>
<I>3.6.2 Calculating the Variance Inflation factor</I>
<BR/>a. First we calculated cluster size. When numbers of participants in each analysis were provided, these numbers were divided by the number of clusters to calculate cluster size. Otherwise, we used the number of participants provided in the methods sections of the primary studies and divided that by the number of clusters.<BR/>b. Then, we found appropriate Intra-Cluster Correlations (ICCs). For weight and height for <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1962</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK>, we used the ICCs published in Du's 2005 letter to the editor; (<LINK REF="REF-Du-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 2005</LINK>). Thus we used ICCs of 0.025 and 0.016 for weight and height respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with ICCs of .01, .05, and .10 for both weight and height. We conducted further sensitivity analyses for each outcome to assess how large the ICC needed to be to change the results. Varying the ICC to these extreme values did not change the statistical significance of any of the pooled results.<BR/>For math, reading, spelling, attendance and intelligence outcomes in Agarwal (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989-_x002d_-boys" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989 - boys</LINK>) and/or the Powell (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK>) studies, we used ICCs of 0.15, with sensitivity analyses at 0.10 and 0.20. This was based on recommendations from the Schochet report (<LINK REF="REF-Schochet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schochet 2005</LINK>) for math and reading.<BR/>c. Then, for experimental and control groups separately, we calculated the VIF as follows:<BR/>(1+ (m-1) multiplied by (ICC), where m is the average cluster size (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). We then multiplied the original standard deviation by the square root of the VIF for experimental and control groups separately. These adjusted standard deviations were then entered into the RevMan data tables.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.7 Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>
<I>3.7.1 Equity question. </I>We had planned to perform subgroup analyses by socio-economic status as well as baseline nutritional status. However, none of the included studies presented tables stratified by SES (although two did briefly describe results by SES). Two studies presented results stratified by baseline nutritional status (Powell 1998 (A), <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>), this was used in a subgroup analysis as a proxy for SES. Meta-regression was used to test for an interaction between baseline nutritional status and height and weight.<BR/>
<I>3.7.2 Age</I>
<BR/>Because growth rates may vary by age, we conducted a subgroup analysis across age groups for weight and height. We also planned to do subgroup analyses by age for cognition, as it is possible that the effectiveness of school meals in changing cognitive outcomes may vary according to age. However, our data were not sufficient to do this.<BR/>
<I>3.7.3 Sex</I>
<BR/>We also conducted subgroup analyses by sex, and reviewed each study to determine whether or not they reported interactions between sex and outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.8. Potential effect modifiers</HEADING>
<P>We carefully examined several of the process elements listed above: high/low energy, compliance, substitution, and duration of the intervention. Study quality may also impact on findings; studies of lower quality often show higher effect sizes than those of higher quality. For example, biased outcome assessment is possible in situations where those who assess the outcome variables are not blinded to study group (i.e., intervention or control).<BR/>To better understand the influence of potential effect modifiers, we tabulated effects for each study sorting them by type of study, blinding versus unclear blinding, date of study, and high versus low energy ( <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.9 Presentation of raw and absolute differences</HEADING>
<P>Since absolute and relative differences convey different information, and both are needed to make an informed decision (<LINK REF="REF-Hembroff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hembroff 2004</LINK>) we calculated both absolute and relative differences between intervention and control conditions. The absolute difference in change from baseline was calculated by the Review Manager analysis as the difference in change from baseline between the school meal and control groups. We calculated the relative % change as the difference in change divided by the baseline of the control group of the most representative study. Because height and weight both increase over time, we also calculated the % change relative to the rate of change as the difference in change scores (over the study periods) divided by the control group rate of change over the same time period (using a weighted average of the rate of change in all studies, using the same weights as the Review Manager analysis).</P>

Sensitivity analyses with ICCs of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 made little difference.

They report significant treatment effects for verbal fluency (P value &lt; 0.02) and a significant treatment by nutritional status interaction (P value &lt; 0.05). Those children who were undernourished (defined as 1 or more than 1 standard deviation below National Centre for Health Statistics references) had scores (unadjusted for clustering) that were 1.5 points higher after receiving breakfast than when they received the placebo (P value &lt; 0.01). However, breakfast made no difference to the children who were classified as adequately nourished (above - 1 s.d. for weight- for-age). No significant effects of school feeding were found on information processing, visual search or digit span for either well-nourished or undernourished children.</P>
<P>Jacoby and his colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Jacoby-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacoby 1996</LINK>) studied the short-term effects on performance in a battery of psycho educational tests: 1) the coding subtest from the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children, 2) a test of reading comprehension from the Inter-American Series, 3) a test of vocabulary from the Inter-American Series, and 4) a test of functions and abilities related to the math curriculum. An Analysis of Covariance controlling for sex, height-for-age z-score, weight - residual (weight regressed on age and height), SES, home language, repetition of any grade, and age on entry to school; current enrolment in grade, school nested in treatment group, and interactions between height-for-age and treatment and weight-for-age and height was used. Significant effects were seen for vocabulary only; the main effect of breakfast overall was not significant, but there was a significant interaction between baseline weight-for-age and height and treatment (parameter estimate = 0.37, F = 4.97, P value &lt; 0.05). This interaction meant that the heavier children benefited most from school breakfast. The authors noted that the combination of smaller than average stature and normal weight for height are common among poor Peruvians, and that 'this phenomenon reflects a protracted deficit of critical nutrients due to poor diet and infection' (p. 62) (<LINK REF="STD-Jacoby-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacoby 1996</LINK>). Thus he hypothesized that those who were heavier than normal were likely to be of poorer health and less well nourished than the other children.</P>

<P>One cluster RCT in a high income country (<LINK REF="STD-Shemilt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shemilt 2004</LINK>) assessed concentration with the Trail Making Test three months after breakfast clubs were initiated in a number of schools where each school decided on meal content. For children in school years 2-11, the time taken to complete the Trail Making Test was significantly shorter in the intervention group at 3 months; the time taken by the intervention group was 3.70 seconds logged and the time taken by the control group was 3.71 seconds. The ratio of adjusted geometric means was 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 -1.00). It is important to note that contamination had occurred; by the time of first follow-up, 2 schools randomized to the control group were running breakfast clubs. Furthermore, not all of the 17 schools randomized to the experimental conditions ran breakfast clubs.</P>

<P>In a sub-study of the larger Chandler study (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1995</LINK>), Chang and colleagues reported that the behaviour of a sub-sample of children was observed during structured teaching and during work on an assigned task (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1996</LINK>). Behaviour only improved with school breakfast in one school, deteriorated in two schools, and was not affected in the other.

<P>Subgroup analysis of the Powell RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1998-_x0028_A_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1998 (A)</LINK> in RevMan demonstrate a significant gain of 0.30 cm in the undernourished group and a non-significant gain of 0.17 in the well-nourished group. However, formal analyses showed a non-significant interaction between baseline nutritional status and height gain (fixed and mixed effects Q/Z = 69.7, P = 0.404). Grillenberger (<LINK REF="REF-Grillenberger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grillenberger 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) presented a graph showing results by baseline height-for-age z-score.

<I>D2.1.3. </I>As previously described, Jacoby (<LINK REF="STD-Jacoby-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacoby 1996</LINK>) reported an interaction between weight-residual (based on regressing weight-on-height and age) and treatment; those children in the experimental group with higher initial weights showed significantly improved vocabulary scores. Chandler (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1995</LINK>) found that breakfast significantly improved verbal fluency only for children who were underweight (&lt;= -1 s.d. below reference values in weight-for-age).<BR/>Another way of looking at effectiveness by need is to compare lower-income countries and higher income countries. The assumption here is that if school meals are more effective for those in greatest need, they should show larger effects in lower-income countries where the need is presumably greatest. As <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> show, effect sizes for weight and height are generally higher in lower-income countries when comparing studies in lower-income countries to studies in higher income countries from the latter half of this century (Paige is the exception to this (<LINK REF="STD-Paige-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Paige 1976</LINK>)). However, if one examines studies done in the 1920s in higher income countries, effect sizes for weight and height are very similar (or higher) than those for later studies in lower-income countries. The study by Paige also resulted in significant effects on weight and height (<LINK REF="STD-Paige-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Paige 1976</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our meta-analyses of height and weight gain described above show there was a large difference between RCTs and CBAs in height gain (0.35 cm (n.s) in RCTs and 1.45 cm (sig) in the CBAs). For weight, differences between RCTs and CBAs in meta-analyses were smaller (0.39 kg in RCTS and 0.71 kg in CBAs); both showed significant overall effects.

They all found that the net increase in energy intake was far lower than the amount of energy provided by the meal. For example, Agarwal reported that the mid-day meal program provided 450-500 kcal and 25% of the RDA for energy, but that the average daily increase in the supplemented group was only 200 kcal while in the Peruvian breakfast study (<LINK REF="STD-Jacoby-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacoby 1996</LINK>), the meal contained an average of 600 kcal but the net increase in intake was 288 kcal.

In this study, non-significant results were found on cognitive tests. The Tisdall study (<LINK REF="STD-Tisdall-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Tisdall 1951</LINK>) sheds important light on the issue as they compared 'good attenders 'to 'poor attenders' (nearly 2/3 of the school lunch groups) in many analyses.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 22:02:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In performing this review, we found that many of the articles on school feeding did not use rigorous outcome assessment. Many articles simply provide descriptions of the nutritional quality of school meals and /or the dietary intake of participants, others describe program operation, management, or cost, others simply survey participants, parents, or providers. Another group of studies comprise cross-sectional comparisons of participants and non-participants; still others are longitudinal studies with no control. The 18 included and 12 excluded studies included in this review are the only studies we found which assessed effectiveness with a reasonable degree of rigour. Despite the practical difficulties involved in undertaking research on school meals, it is clear that more high quality research on school feeding programs needs to be undertaken in both higher and lower income countries.<BR/>We included a wide range of studies in this review; they were conducted over eight decades and in many different countries. Their heterogeneity in terms of setting, historical/policy context, sample, inclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes is striking. Sorting the studies into historical order gives a feel for the way the focus of the research has moved from en masse feeding of the disadvantaged and measuring growth plus 'general condition' of the children to a much tighter focus on selected samples of the socially excluded and measuring cognitive and educational performance as well as growth.</P>
<P>The quality of included studies improved over time. Some of the earlier studies (which go back to the 1920s) were probably excellent according to standards of their time, but were not described in enough detail to allow them to meet current quality criteria. Reports from studies in the 1960s and 1970s also lacked sufficient detail. Methodological quality was highest in the more recent studies from lower-income countries. Our process evaluation showed a great deal of variability in study implementation and in attention to important confounders. This is discussed more fully under potential confounders.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">A. Effects of school feeding on growth </HEADING>
<P>In this review, we found positive, significant effects of school feeding on weight in lower-income countries and mixed, but generally positive effects in higher income countries. Extrapolating from the average yearly gain seen in RCTS in our review, if meals were given throughout six years of primary school as suggested by Powell 1998 (A), total gains could be 1.3 kg. Extrapolating from the CBA results suggests gains of 4.5 kg over the six year period of primary school.</P>
<P>In terms of height, results from lower income countries were mixed, but in higher income countries, results were moderate and positive. Interestingly, evidence from our subgroup analyses in lower income countries shows that height gain was significantly greater for younger children than for mixed age groups. However, it is difficult to determine whether this trend is due to age, or to low energy content of the interventions that did not seperate out children by age.</P>
<P>It is difficult to determine clinical significance for growth, particularly in this review. There are a number of reasons for this: 1) lack of standards for weight and height gain in school age children, 2) few studies presented data on baseline nutritional status and the importance of change depends on this, and 3) growth velocity will differ among different ages of school age children, and in most studies, results were not presented by age group. It is important to note, however, that effects on weight were small.</P>
<P>As noted in the introduction, growth may not be the most important outcome of school feeding. Other outcomes may have an important impact on education and on later functioning. These outcomes include: decreased morbidity, increased muscle mass, improved attention and behaviour, improved academic achievement and improved cognitive functioning. Although these benefits are sometimes seen at the same time as improved growth, it is essential to study them separately rather than infer them from increased growth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">B. Other physical outcomes </HEADING>
<P>Results from one study suggested that school feeding with meat led to an increase in muscle mass. Grillenberger et al, when considering the Kenya study, hypothesized that the higher quality protein and more available micronutrients in the meat supplement may have been responsible for these differences. If this finding on increased muscle mass was replicated, it could be important, as increased muscle mass has important practical implications, including the potential for increased work and play capacity. However, it is important to note that, as this outcome was only assessed in one study, results can only be taken as preliminary (<LINK REF="REF-Grillenberger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grillenberger 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>) reported increased bone mineral content and bone mineral density in pre-adolescent Chinese girls who had been given milk fortified with calcium at school. The percentage change from baseline (3.1%) is comparable to a 2% change reported in a systematic review of the effectiveness of calcium in post-menopausal women and of 1.8% found in a systematic review of the effectiveness of exercise in post-menopausal women. Higher BMD means stronger bones through life, and lower possibility of fracture. Further study in this area is clearly warranted.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects on Biochemical outcomes </HEADING>
<P>It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of school feeding on biochemical outcomes, as only a few studies reported on them. In those that did, results for haemoglobin and hematocrit were mixed, and except for Vitamin B12 and Vitamin A, other biochemical outcomes were unaffected by feeding. In the case of Vitamin A, Tisdall noted that differences were not clinically meaningful (<LINK REF="STD-Tisdall-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Tisdall 1951</LINK>). However, Seikmann (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) noted that the high prevalence of disease and infections among the children in their study could have accounted for their null biochemical findings. Furthermore, studies in this review focused on feeding rather than micronutrient supplementation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">C. Psychological outcomes/ clinical relevance </HEADING>
<P>In general, there are two ways through which school feeding may impact on cognitive function; 1) long-term contributions of feeding to overall health and brain function and 2) short-term metabolic changes due to immediate energy supply (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus far in school feeding studies, only a few researchers have paid attention to the selection of appropriate cognitive outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). None of the studies administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, which would include intelligence, attention, processing speed, executive functioning, learning and memory, visual skills, motor and sensory performance, and academic achievement. With the exception of a few studies, test selection largely appeared arbitrary. The finding of affected cognitive functions is partially dependent on tests given. Most of the tasks administered in the reviewed studies emphasize processing speed, attention, working memory, semantic retrieval, and academic achievement. Very few studies focused on long-term memory retention, sensory or motor abilities.</P>
<P>In the majority of the studies included in this review, it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of the findings. Many of the reports fail to include the range, mean and standard deviation of the specific cognitive measures, fail to adequately describe the cognitive measures used or how conventional measures were adapted or modified, and how the reported scores were derived. Furthermore, there is no universally agreed-upon definition of clinical significance in this field. However, we were able to draw some inferences about clinical relevance.</P>
<P>Significant improvements in math performance were consistently found in studies from low income countries. Thus, we conclude that school feeding can result in improvements in math performance. The arithmetic measures used in these 4 studies vary and it is difficult to determine the clinical relevance of these statistically significant findings without further information about the psychometric properties of the tests. However, it seems as if the small effect found in the Kenya study (<LINK REF="REF-Whaley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whaley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>)is probably not clinically significant. In contrast, authors of the Powell RCT (Powell 1998 (A)) noted that although the improvement in arithmetic as a result of breakfast was small, the increase represents about 30% of the average yearly progress. Furthermore, the difference found in the two CBAs represents a gain in the experimental group that is 1/3 of a standard deviation greater thathe gain in controls.</P>
<P>Results from two studies suggest that school feeding may impact on intelligence type tests, but these results are far from conclusive. Results from the Agarwal study (a small CBA) are difficult to interpret because we had to use ICCs from achievement tests and significance differed according to whether subgroups or totals were used (this was due to differences in cluster size). If replicated, these results would be important. For example, the Performance IQ increase of 5 points represents a third of a standard deviation. The observed FSIQ increase of 4 points (one-fourth of a standard deviation) is comparable to that seen between breast-fed and formula fed infants, which is considered to be clinically significant and is used extensively to promote breast-feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>). For the Kenya study (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) on Raven's progressive Matrices, as the authors report that the range of scores on this test is 0-30, a 0.34-point per year advantage seems rather modest.</P>
<P>In the Chandler study those who received breakfast generated 1.5 more words on average on the semantic verbal fluency task than controls. Assuming that scores across two categories were summed, the undernourished children in the treatment group generated less than 1 additional word per category relative to controls. A review of norms for 1 minute semantic verbal fluency tasks (similar to those used by Chandler et al) for 8 and 9 year olds reveal standard deviations in the range of 2.7 to 3.9 words per category (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 1989</LINK>). Thus, a relative increase of less than one word per category is probably not clinically significant.</P>
<P>Although there are discrepancies, most of the psychosocial outcomes in this review that improved as a result with school feeding are related. These include: fluid intelligence, processing speed, and arithmetic. These functions require more concentration and attention; and application of skills and/or rules to novel situations. In contrast, outcomes such as spelling achievement are done by rote. It has been hypothesized that these cognitive functions are highly dependent on the functional integrity of the central nervous system (CNS) and may fluctuate from moment to moment due to physical or emotional factors (<LINK REF="REF-Belsky-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsky 1990</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects on School Attendance</HEADING>
<P>
<BR/>One of the most commonly cited benefits of school feeding is in improved attendance. The mechanisms for enhancing attendance may include not only the attraction of a free meal, but also possible effects on immune function that reduce illness and the effect on concentration that may make school more enjoyable.</P>
<P>The results of this review are consistent with other findings showing that school meals can improve school attendance in lower income countries. However, effects were small. Taking estimates from the two RCTs together, in a school year of 172 days a year (i.e. Peru), this would mean an increase of 4 to 6 days per year. The improvement in attendance noted in three CBAs in the United States was lower (and non-significant). This difference may be due to the fact that children in higher-income countries had more regular attendance at baseline than those from lower-income countries. It may also be due to the fact that families in lower-income countries were more motivated by the prospects of receiving food. This fits well with the high non-compliance rate we observed in many of the North American studies. These studies suggest that the impact of free school meals on school attendance may be greatest in areas of greatest poverty.</P>
<P>Improved attendance could mean greater opportunities for learning and mental stimulation and consequently, improved academic performance, more opportunities for social interaction with adults and peers, and possibly, a better attitude towards school. However, it is difficult to say whether the projected 4 to 6 days of increased attendance per year in lower and lower-middle income countries is sufficient to result in such changes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Playground activity. Results from one study in our review indicate that playground activity levels, particularly pro-social activity, are higher for those who received school meals; although absolute differences are small, relative differences are large.</P>
<P>Evidence from three of our included studies shows that school feeding may have positive effects on classroom behaviour in both high and low income countries. However, as discussed below, effects may depend on the quality of the educational environment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">D. Possible Confounders</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of factors that could have impacted on effectiveness; here we provide details on a few of them. It is important to note that although potential confounders are looked at individually, the reality is much more complex and confounders are likely highly intertwined.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D1. Substitution</HEADING>
<P>As mentioned in the introduction, one important concern in school feeding studies is substitution. In poor families, to spread limited resources, the home diet may be reduced for children who are receiving food at school. In two studies that assessed substitution (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacoby-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jacoby 1996</LINK>), the net increase in energy realized by the children was less than half of that provided by school feeding (breakfast and lunch). In the Kenyan study, the net increase was 140 out of 239 calories for the meat group (our experimental group). Children who were given the 'milk' and 'energy' supplements actually showed net decreases of more than 100 calories. This may reduce the effectiveness of school feeding programs on children's growth and cognitive performance. Therefore, experts recommend that the amount and composition of food should be sufficient to overcome this problem. It may be that a mid-morning meal could help prevent substitution since it would be seen as a snack, not a meal (personal communication, <LINK REF="REF-Galloway-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galloway 2006</LINK>). Our data do not allow us to explore this hypothesis since none of these three studies with data on substitution used mid-morning snacks.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the results from the Kenyan Study (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) suggest that parents of control children may compensate for the fact that their children don't get fed at school. Over the 24 month period of the study, energy increase for the children in the control group increased by nearly 200 calories. This finding may be peculiar to this particular study, but it is quite interesting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D2. Energy intensity of meal/snack</HEADING>
<P>It seems logical that the energy intensity provided by school meals would impact on outcome. Our review provides some support for this hypothesis. Three (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1962</LINK>; Baker 1980; <LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) that provided low energy levels (9, 5, and 13 percent, respectively) showed either small or null effects on weight and height, while two (Du 2003; <LINK REF="STD-Paige-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Paige 1976</LINK>) showed effectiveness for both, and another one (Leiberman 1976) did not report changes in weight relative to controls. However, in the two low energy studies that showed effectiveness (Du 2003; <LINK REF="STD-Paige-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Paige 1976</LINK>) fortified milk or drink was provided; this may have produced positive results in the absence of high energy. Furthermore, students in the Du study that did not drink the milk on &gt; 4 days were excluded from the analyses, indicating a high compliance rate for this study (<LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>). Therefore, although the energy content was higher in some studies, children may have been ingesting more calories and other nutrients due to higher compliance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D3. Pupil / student compliance</HEADING>
<P>Another factor that is almost certain to impact on effectiveness is compliance. While compliance rates were very high in the Kenya study (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>), two studies from higher income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tisdall-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Tisdall 1951</LINK>) reported very low compliance rates. It is therefore, not surprising that these studies showed little effect. Results from Tisdall (<LINK REF="STD-Tisdall-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Tisdall 1951</LINK>) substantiate the idea that children who attend regularly are more likely to benefit. In analyses comparing 'good attenders' to 'poor attenders' and controls, the 'good attenders' did better than the poor attenders. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK> eliminated non-compliant children (those not taking the milk supplement on &gt;4 days for any reason) from analyses and had large effects for both weight and height gain. Thus, it seems as if compliance can indeed affect outcomes of school feeding. Most studies in the review did not report on compliance. We suggest that in the future, compliance be carefully monitored and reported.</P>
<P>The lack of compliance shown in several studies in high income countries suggests that school feeding programs in higher income countries should take measures to increase compliance. Timing of the meal may be important in high income countries; it seems logical that students would be less likely to attend school breakfast (which means leaving home early) than they would be to attend lunch or a snack session.</P>
<P>The degree to which those who implement the intervention comply with the protocol (e.g. continuous provision of food, complying with group assignment) is very likely to impact on results. For example, in the Shemilt study, some experimental schools implemented breakfast clubs before baseline measurements could be taken; others (4 out of 17) did not have breakfast clubs at the time of first follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Shemilt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shemilt 2004</LINK>). Also, two of the control groups provided breakfast at the time of the first follow-up. This type of contamination could have influenced results, although the extent of this influence is not clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D4. Short-term reduction in hunger</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from this and other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>) shows that short-term relief of hunger through breakfast can improve performance on cognitive tasks carried out on the same morning. Thus, in long-term studies, it is quite important to control for this by giving a meal to all children on the day of testing. In that way, researchers can determine whether results are due to the long-term effects of providing food rather than simply to immediate improvements as a result of morning feeding. However, only one of the longer-term studies in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK>) did this. We would suggest that in the future, all studies assessing the impact of feeding on outcomes such as intelligence, neuropsychological functioning, and academic achievement should consider controlling for the effects of hunger by feeding children in both the intervention and control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D5. Study duration</HEADING>
<P>For growth, one would expect to see effects on weight with shorter study durations, and effects on height only with longer durations. In this review, studies that assessed growth were generally of long duration; the shortest was seven months. In reviewing the results, it is difficult to discern any clear pattern by duration of the study. The Du study (<LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>) was the longest at 24 months and showed large changes in height, but others with similar durations of 23 months (e.g. Grillenberger (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>) had smaller effects. It is possible that the very large changes shown in the Du study were due to factors other than study duration (e.g. compliance and addition of calcium).</P>
<P>For cognition, the importance of study length depends on the outcome measure. It is reasonable to expect to see improved attention and concentration following short-term interventions, while increased performance in other cognitive domains may be demonstrated only following longer feeding intervals. Two studies in this review have suggested that when performance is evaluated using a mechanical, stimulus-response format (for example, "put a ring round all the letter As on this page"), short-term feeding has little impact on performance, whereas if the test involves a greater degree of creativity and motivation and the expenditure of cognitive effort (for example, "name as many animals as you can in time limit Y"), feeding has a significant effect. For example, the Chandler study (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1995</LINK>) showed a small impact on verbal fluency for children who were at least one standard deviation below normal weight-for-age. However, this improvement was not seen in other tasks that are more rote such as digit span or information processing.</P>
<P>Within the longer-term interventions, it is difficult to discern whether or not a pattern exists according to length of the study. This is largely due to the fact that outcomes were so different, and few could be combined. For math, effects were strongest for the Agarwal study (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK> ), which lasted longest 24 months. The Kenya study (<LINK REF="STD-Neumann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neumann 2003</LINK>)) lasted 23 months, however, and effects were quite small.</P>
<P>The interval between feeding and cognitive testing may also prove to be an important variable. It is expected that feeding would have immediate, but short-lived effects on cognitive processes such as processing speed and attention. Measurement of these functions should occur within minutes or hours of the feeding in order to quantify these changes. In contrast, feeding programs of a longer duration, such as months to years would be required to effect improvements on language, learning or academic tests and the interval between feeding and testing is less important when measuring these functions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D6. Benevolent attention</HEADING>
<P>A mechanism of action, implicit in some later studies, is that provision of school breakfast makes children feel valued and increases the general attention given to them. According to Powell (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK>), benevolent attention may be possible confounding factor in school feeding studies. Thus it is important to ensure that children in the control group receive the same amount of attention as those in the experimental group. However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1983</LINK> study, benevolent attention didn't seem to make a difference. Despite this, we conclude that control groups in school-based feeding studies should receive benevolent attention in order to control for this potential confounder.<BR/>D7. Quality of the educational environment</P>
<P>The quality of the educational environment plays an important role in learning. For example, Levinger (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1996</LINK>) noted that quality of instruction, teacher quality, and quality of the learning materials can play an important role in improving children's capacity to learn. There is some evidence for this in a sub-study of the larger Chandler study. Here, improvements in behaviour were only seen in one school that was 'adequately equipped and organized'. Chang speculated that when classroom conditions were conducive to learning, the extra energy provided by breakfast could result in improved behaviour. However, when the atmosphere for learning was poor, this extra energy could not be channelled appropriately.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">E Effect modifiers</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">E1 Age </HEADING>
<P>Evidence from this review shows that younger children realize greater height benefits than older children. However, it is important to note that few studies on growth involved older children and that some of our studies did not separate out age groups.<BR/>Few studies in our review assessed the interaction between age and treatment effectiveness on cognition, although one study did show that younger children benefited more from feeding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">E4. Sex</HEADING>
<P>We found that there was generally little evidence for difference in effectiveness by sex.</P>
<P>In terms of cognition, developmental studies have shown that sex differences in cognition in children are evident as early as the age of five. For example, girls are more proficient than boys in verbal memory, (<LINK REF="REF-Maccoby-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maccoby 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1997</LINK>) verbal fluency and spelling (<LINK REF="REF-Gaddes-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaddes 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2003</LINK>) and one study suggested that in adolescence, females surpass males in information processing speed and working memory (<LINK REF="REF-Barr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2003</LINK>). Thus, we might expect to find sex differences in cognitive responsiveness to school feeding. However, none of the studies presented data on this topic. We also found no discussion of potential cultural and social differences (e.g. in food intake at home) according to sex.</P>
<P>Considering that the World Food Program strategic plan includes reduction of sex disparities as a goal of school-feeding, the relationship between sex and the effectiveness of school meals clearly warrants further investigation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">F. Equity question: Effectiveness by level of disadvantage</HEADING>
<P>
<BR/>Results from this review provide some preliminary evidence that school meals may be more effective for those who are more in need. Furthermore, relative to controls, undernourished children showed greater gains in short-term cognitive performance than did well nourished children. The findings on short-term cognition support Pollitt's (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1995</LINK>) conclusions that children who are undernourished seem to be more responsive cognitively to short-term increases in energy.</P>
<P>A further bit of evidence for greater effectiveness in poorer children is suggested by our findings that: 1) effects on attendance and cognition were greater in low income countries, 2) within more recent studies, effects on weight were higher in lower income countries, and 3) effects from very old studies in higher income countries were highest. The latter finding can be explained by that fact that children in the Corry-Mann study were from a home for destitute, or orphaned boys in 1920s England, and that the Orr study was performed in a mining village in 1920s Scotland in a time of recession and, unemployment. Thus these children were very disadvantaged.</P>
<P>However, it is very important to note that data on effectiveness by level of disadvantage was very limited.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>School meals may have a number of small benefits for children. In the studies reviewed, school meals resulted in small improvements in weight, height in younger children, attendance, math performance, and behaviour. Evidence suggests a possible impact on intelligence tests, but replication is needed. Evidence from single studies shows that school meals may also increase bone mineral density, arm muscle, and Vitamin B concentrations. The magnitude of benefits realized are probably dependent on the design of the program, amount of energy and other nutrients provided by the meal/snack, baseline nutritional status, conditions for learning in the classroom, timing of meal/snack, substitution and social environment at home, age of the child, and not surprisingly, on compliance. However, it is unrealistic to expect that school meals or any other single intervention can be a panacea for all of the deprivation of children living in poverty. </P>
<P>In considering the worth of school meals, it is also important to consider intangibles such as the worth and pleasure derived from having a full stomach and eating a good meal. This is something qualitative that it is difficult to measure adequately, but the relief of hunger alone is important.</P>
<P>School meal programs should be well-designed, and provide sufficient energy, protein, fat and micronutrient content for children's age and baseline nutritional status. Special attention should be paid to ensure that micronutrients important for growth, physical health, and cognition such as iodine, iron, zinc, Vitamin B-12, and calcium are provided. The amount and type of fat and cholesterol should also be taken into account given their role in structure and function of parts of the brain which continue to develop into adolescence and influence cognitive outcome. Since 1969, the pattern of nutritional status in high-income countries has shifted from under-nutrition to increasing obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Dubois-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubois 2006</LINK>). Thus, in higher income countries, it is important to provide well-balanced meals that are not overly energy or fat laden. </P>
<P>Palatability and special needs of the target population are also extremely important. Food should be appealing, acceptable, and locally available. Most of the researchers in included studies went to a great deal of trouble to ensure that foods were culturally acceptable and tempting to the palate. In terms of digestibility, Paige hypothesized that the African-American children in the population studied had a high prevalence of lactose deficiency (that is, they were intolerant of milk), as evidenced by the fact that in a pilot study, 25% of them had rejected a cow's milk supplement even when chocolate flavoured. The definitive intervention comprised a specially formulated low-lactose milk supplement tailored to the particular physiological make-up of the population and refined in response to the children's feedback on its palatability; a significant impact on growth was demonstrated. This study prompts the additional conclusion that piloting a school nutrition intervention is not just about confirming palatability, but about identifying specific nutritional issues / needs in the program's target population. Follow-up results from one study in the developing world reported that most effects of feeding with milk disappeared three years after feeding stopped; this would suggest that school feeding should be continued throughout school years (<LINK REF="STD-Du-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2004</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Considering the dearth of high quality evidence on school meals, as well as the complexity of our findings, we conclude that further well-designed research is needed in both lower and higher income countries. RCTs are needed in order to ensure that causality can be attributed. We suggest randomisation by school, and appropriate statistical methods to account for cluster randomization. In order to more clearly answer the question about effects by level of disadvantage, we would like to see all primary researchers provide breakdowns of effects by socio-economic status of parents as well as by sex and baseline nutritional status. Double blinding should also be considered in terms of providing, meals/snacks with similar appearance but high and negligible content of energy and other nutrients (e.g. high and low calorie milk shakes).</P>
<P>In conducting studies, attention needs to be paid to ensuring that the intervention is delivered as intended. Process evaluation is crucial. As shown in this review, it is very important to encourage full participation, and to measure participation, and consumption carefully.. We might tentatively conclude for future trials that measuring non-consumption of food is best done for each individual child. Substitution should also be monitored. We also conclude that studies on long-term effects of school feeding should feed children in both groups on the day of testing to control for the relief of short-term hunger. Other factors such as benevolent attention and quality of educational environment should also be considered. </P>
<P>We suggest that in terms of physical health, important outcomes are: changes in weight and height, muscle mass, body fat percentage, micronutrient status, physical activity, and bone mineral density. Weight is an important outcome, both in lower income countries where programs seek to increase growth of under-nourished children, and in high income countries where school feeding programs increasingly aim to reduce childhood obesity rather than increase growth. </P>
<P>For psychosocial outcomes, attendance, enrolment, and retention in school are all highly important for lower-income countries. This is particularly true for girls. As education of the populace is key to a country's improved development, school feeding should be combined with other interventions that aim to improve country educational attainment. It is essential to measure educational achievement and cognitive outcomes in all countries. We suggest that in the next generation of studies of school feeding on cognitive performance, the choice of tests should be explicitly hypothesis-driven so as to discriminate between different cognitive and motivational effects. It is important to measure a full range of brain function with neuropsychological testing: we suggest a comprehensive assessment of intelligence, processing speed, attention, executive functions, memory, language, visual-abilities and motor and sensory function. In order to disentangle the effects of short-term hunger relief from long-term physiological changes, we suggest that all children be fed before psychological testing. </P>
<P>School meal programs take place in a context which may significantly impact on their effectiveness. As noted by Levinger (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>), greater improvements can be expected if the environment in which children live and learn is also improved. Thus, in addition to school meals, schools should have the basic amenities necessary to good education: adequate materials, good teaching, and an emphasis on development of the whole child. Others such as Glew have emphasized the importance of improvements in water supply, health, and health education (<LINK REF="REF-Glew-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glew 1980</LINK>) while Del Rosso (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 1999</LINK>) emphasized micronutrient fortification or supplementation and health and nutrition education. As others have suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Levinger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 1999</LINK>) we conclude that school meals should be one of multiple interventions designed to improve the health and development of poor and marginalized children.</P>
