<P>The methods were updated according to version 5.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This involved changes of the outcomes so that they are now of relevance also to the patients and changes to the risk of bias domains. This resulted in a change in the findings and conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>The intervention 'primary closure with biliary stent' was considered to be very different from 'primary closure without biliary stent'. Hence the intervention 'primary closure with biliary stent' was excluded from the review. 'Primary closure with a biliary stent' should be the subject of another review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-05 10:27:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The liver has various functions. Production of bile is one of these functions. Bile is necessary for digestion of fat and removal of certain waste byproducts from the liver. The bile produced in the liver is stored temporarily in the gallbladder. On eating fatty food, the gallbladder releases the bile into the small bowel. The common bile duct is the tube through which bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel. Stones can obstruct the flow of bile from the gallbladder into the small bowel. Usually such stones are formed in the gallbladder and migrate into the common bile duct. Obstruction to the flow of bile can lead to jaundice. Such stones are usually removed by inserting an endoscope (introducing an instrument equipped with a camera through the mouth and into the small intestine) before keyhole removal of gallstones (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), or as a part of keyhole removal of gallstones (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration). Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can only be performed in highly specialised centres and so endoscopic removal of the common bile duct stone is the commonly used method to treat stones in the common bile duct. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration involves exploring the common bile duct using instruments or a camera, or both, which are introduced into the common bile duct usually through a cut in the common bile duct. After the stones are removed, the hole in the common bile duct has to be stitched. Traditionally, surgeons have used a T-tube through the cut in the common bile duct but they seal the cystic duct if the exploration is performed through the cystic duct. The T-tube is shaped like the English letter 'T' as the name indicates. The top part of the letter 'T' is inside the common bile duct while the long bottom part of the 'T' is brought out of the tummy through a small cut and connected to a bag. This tube is inserted with the intention of preventing the build-up of bile in the common bile duct due to temporary swelling, which is common after any cut in any part of the body. The build-up of bile along with the swelling can potentially prevent the healing of the bile duct resulting in a leakage of bile from the common bile duct into the tummy. Uncontrolled bile leak can be potentially life-threatening if this is not recognised and treated appropriately. In addition to acting as a drain, which drains the bile from the common bile duct to the exterior, dye can be injected into the T-tube and an X-ray used to demonstrate any residual stones. Once the absence of residual stones is confirmed, the T-tube is removed. However, surgeons are concerned about the tiny hole which the T-tube leaves on removal. This tiny hole in the common bile duct normally heals without a trace but, in some patients, bile can leak through this hole and cause the very problem that the T-tube was meant to prevent. Thus, the use of a T-tube after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is a very controversial issue. We have attempted to answer the question whether T-tube drainage is better than primary closure (stitching the cut in the bile duct without a T-tube) after laparoscopic exploration of common bile duct by reviewing all the available information from randomised clinical trials that is in the literature. Randomised clinical trials are a special type of clinical study which provides the most accurate answer if performed correctly.</P>
<P>We identified a total of three trials including 295 participants, of whom 148 were randomly chosen to receive primary closure and the remaining patients had T-tube drainage after laparoscopic exploration of common bile duct. All three trials were at high risk of bias (risk of underestimating or overestimating the benefits and harms of the intervention). There were no deaths in either group. There was no significant difference in the serious complication rate (approximately 97 complications per 1000 patients in the T-tube group versus 61 complications per 1000 participants in the primary closure group) or in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications (11.3% in the T-tube group versus 6.2% in the primary closure group). Although the complication rates in the T-tube group appear to be twice as high as those in the primary closure group, there is a possibility that this was not a true observation but rather a difference that occurred by chance (similar to there being one chance in eight of flipping a coin and having it come up heads or tails four times in a row). For this reason, we cannot be sufficiently confident scientifically that these differences were not just due to chance and that is the reason why we have stated that there was no 'significant' difference. Of course, if such a difference truly exists, it would be clinically important. None of the trials reported the quality of life of the participants. The average operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (by about 20 minutes). The average hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (by about three days). Participants returned to work significantly later in the T-tube group than primary closure group (by about eight days). Use of T-tube appears to increase the cost without providing any benefit to the patients. Further randomised trials with low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of prejudice by healthcare providers, researchers, or patients) with longer follow-up period are necessary. Until the results from such trials are available, we discourage the routine use of T-tube after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-18 15:18:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We included three trials randomising 295 participants: 147 to T-tube drainage versus 148 to primary closure. All trials had a high risk of bias. No one died during the follow-up period. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with serious morbidity (17/147 (weighted percentage 11.3%) in the T-tube drainage versus 9/148 (6.1%) in the primary closure group; RR 1.86; 95% CI 0.87 to 3.96; three trials), and no significant difference was found in the serious morbidity rates (weighted serious morbidity rate = 97 events per 1000 patients) in participants randomised to T-tube drainage versus serious morbidity rate = 61 events per 1000 patients in the primary closure group; RR 1.59; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.83; three trials). Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube drainage group compared with the primary closure group (MD 21.22 minutes; 95% CI 12.44 minutes to 30.00 minutes; three trials). The hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube drainage group compared with the primary closure group (MD 3.26 days; 95% CI 2.49 days to 4.04 days; three trials). According to one trial, the participants randomised to T-tube drainage returned to work approximately eight days later than the participants randomised to the primary closure group (P &lt; 0.005).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-10 17:41:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>T-tube drainage appears to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay as compared with primary closure without any evidence of benefit after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Based on currently available evidence, there is no justification for the routine use of T-tube drainage after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. More randomised trials comparing the effects of T-tube drainage versus primary closure after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration may be needed. Such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias, assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones.</P>

<P>About 5% to 25% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of gallstones is about 1 in 200 people (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Only 2% to 4% of people with gallstones become symptomatic with biliary colic (pain), acute cholecystitis (inflammation), obstructive jaundice, or gallstone pancreatitis in a year (<LINK REF="REF-Attili-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attili 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Cholecystectomy (removal of gallstones) is the preferred option in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Strasberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasberg 1993</LINK>) and every year, 1.5 million cholecystectomies are performed in the United States and 60,000 in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HES-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2011</LINK>). Approximately 80% of the cholecystectomies are performed laparoscopically (key-hole) (<LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>). The reported proportion of patients with common bile duct stones at the time of cholecystectomy varies between 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Kama-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kama 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemli 2004</LINK>) and 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Pitluk-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitluk 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duensing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duensing 2000</LINK>). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently preferred over open cholecystectomy for elective cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>). If stones are found in the common bile duct prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the options include pre-operative or intra-operative endoscopic sphincterotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2011</LINK>) or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. If stones are found in the common bile duct for the first time during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (because of the per-operative cholangiogram), the options include laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by endoscopic sphincterotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1999</LINK>), conversion to open procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Sarli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarli 2003</LINK>), or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (<LINK REF="REF-Hyser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyser 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Ortega-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Ortega 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waage-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waage 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebner 2004</LINK>). Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can be either transcystic (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Ortega-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Ortega 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waage-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waage 2003</LINK>) or performed through a choledochotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waage-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waage 2003</LINK>) depending upon the size and location of the stones (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Memon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Memon 2000</LINK>). Some surgeons use T-tube drainage routinely after choledochotomy and not after successful transcystic common bile duct exploration (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Ortega-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Ortega 2003</LINK>). Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can be performed successfully in the majority of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Ortega-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Ortega 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemli 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>After the common bile duct exploration is performed, the choice lies between T-tube drainage, primary duct closure with no drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Decker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decker 2003</LINK>), or primary duct closure with biliary stent insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Isla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isla 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griniatsos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griniatsos 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The authors assessed the risk of bias in the trials independently, without masking of the trial names, and following the instructions in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>), we assessed the influence of risk of bias on the trial results using the following domains.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation sequence generation</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not, or might not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients were inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations might have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used was likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>

</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the underlying reasons for missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods had been employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the crude estimate of effects (eg, complete case estimate) were clearly biased due to the underlying reasons for missing data, and the methods used to handle missing data were unsatisfactory.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on, or were not reported fully, or it was unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vested interest bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the trial was conducted by a party without any vested interest in the outcome of the trial.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: it was not clear if the trial was conducted by a party with a vested interest in the outcome of the trial.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the trial was conducted by a party with one or more vested interests in the outcome of the trial (such as a T-tube manufacturer).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We considered trials to be of low risk of bias if we assessed all the above domains being of low risk of bias. In all other cases, the trials were considered having high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>). We used the software package Review Manager 5 for all statistical analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) if there were two or more trials for an outcome. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different assessment scales were used with 95% confidence intervals. For serious morbidity, we calculated the proportion of patients with serious morbidity and the number of serious morbidities ('serious morbidity rate') in each group. While the proportion of patients with serious morbidity is a binary outcome, the serious morbidity rate is a count data outcome. For count data outcomes such as serious adverse events, the rate ratio was calculated using the methods shown in section 9.4.8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For such a calculation, one needs the time that the patients were exposed to the risk of serious morbidity in each of the groups. We considered that both groups were exposed to the risk of serious morbidity for the same time period, which is a reasonable assumption considering that the patients were followed up for the same time in both groups.</P>
<P>We used a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) for meta-analysis in the presence of two or more trials included under the outcomes. In case of discrepancy between the two models, we have reported both results; otherwise we have reported the results of the fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was explored by a chi-squared test with significance set at P value 0.10, and the quantity of heterogeneity was measured by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>) whenever possible. Otherwise, we adopted the 'available-patient analysis' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not impute any data for the post-randomisation drop-outs for any of the continuous outcomes. In the absence of summary information such as mean and standard deviation for continuous outcomes, we used the median for the meta-analysis when the mean was not available and imputed the standard deviation from P values according to the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (See Sensitivity analysis below). If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the confidence intervals, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation would decrease the weight of the study for calculation of mean differences and bias the effect estimate to no effect in case of standardised mean difference (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use a funnel plot to explore reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) in the presence of at least 10 trials. We planned to use asymmetry in funnel plot of study size against treatment effect to identify bias. We also planned to perform linear regression approach described by Egger (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) to determine the funnel plot asymmetry.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to perform the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Trials at low risk of bias compared to those at high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Trials in which routine antibiotic prophylaxis was used compared to those in which routine antibiotic prophylaxis was not used.</LI>
<LI>Trials in which patients underwent laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in the presence of acute cholecystitis compared to those in which patients underwent laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in the absence of acute cholecystitis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to use the test for subgroup differences available through RevMan.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis by imputing the outcomes for binary outcomes under different scenarios, namely best-best analysis, worst-worst analysis, best-worst analysis, and worst-best analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>) for any significant binary outcomes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding the trials in which median or standard deviation was imputed for continuous outcomes. Both these sensitivity analyses were planned a priori (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2007</LINK>). We also performed post-hoc sensitivity analyses by considering the complications for which the severity could not be determined as 'mild' complications (best-best scenario) and then we considered these 'mild' complications as severe complications (worst-worst scenario). For example, bile leaks are post-operative complications some of which resolve spontaneously without any prolongation of hospital stay and hence were categorised as 'mild' adverse events. Other bile leaks need radiological or endoscopic interventions and hence were classified as 'serious' adverse events. If the trial authors did not report the way the bile leaks were treated, it was not possible to determine their severity. So, we performed two analyses - one, excluding the bile leaks which resolved spontaneously and those, for which the treatment was not reported, and another analysis including the bile leaks for which the treatment was not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was applied because cumulative meta-analyses are at risk of producing random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of the accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). To minimise random errors, we calculated the required information size (ie, the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect). The required information size calculation should also account for the heterogeneity or diversity present in the meta-analysis. The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis. We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, the trials were added alphabetically according to the last name of the first author. On the basis of the required information size, trial sequential monitoring boundaries were constructed. These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size; if the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed before the required information size is reached, firm evidence may perhaps be established and further trials may turn out to be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundary is not surpassed, it is most probably necessary to continue doing trials in order to detect or reject a certain intervention effect.   </P>
<P>We performed trial sequential analysis for binary outcomes and continuous outcomes in which at least two trials were present to determine if further trials are necessary on the topic (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). We performed the trial sequential analysis using an alpha error of 5%, beta error of 20%, control event proportion obtained from the results, and a relative risk reduction of 20% for binary outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). For continuous outcomes, we conducted the trial sequential analysis using alpha error of 5%, beta error of 20%, the variance of the included trials, and a minimal clinically important difference of one day for hospital stay and 15 minutes for operating time.</P>

<P>All three trials reported this outcome. The mean value of the operating time was missing in one trial and was imputed from the median (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>).The standard deviation was not reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>). The standard deviation was calculated using the P value in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>) and from the inter-quartile range in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>). The meta-analysis showed that the operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (MD 21.22 minutes; 95% CI 12.44 to 30.00; P &lt; 0.00001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The results were not changed by excluding the trials in which means or standard deviations were imputed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>The trial sequential analysis of operating time shows that the accumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary after the second trial favouring primary closure. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 414 patients based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 2962, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%.

The mean was imputed from the median in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>). The hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (MD 3.26 days; 95% CI 2.49 to 4.04; P &lt; 0.00001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>The trial sequential analysis of hospital stay shows that the accumulative Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary after the second trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 724 patients based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of one day, a variance (VAR) of 23.04, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-25 13:42:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This systematic review shows that T-tube drainage might increase the operating time and hospital stay without any evidence of difference in serious complications. One of the reasons for considering the employment of T-tube drainage is to decompress the common bile duct if there is distal obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1994</LINK>). This is to avoid bile leak and bile peritonitis. In the three trials including 148 patients allocated to the primary closure group (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>), the biliary complications in the primary closure group included one patient with bile leak requiring endoscopic stent (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>), one patient with bile leak requiring percutaneous drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>), and another patient developing biliary pancreatitis requiring endoscopic stent (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>). In contrast, of the 147 patients belonging to the T-tube closure group in the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>), the biliary complications included seven patients who required open re-operations for bile peritonitis, T-tube dislodgement, or bleeding from the choledochotomy wound, three patients requiring percutaneous drainage for bile leak, and one patient developing acute pancreatitis which settled without any surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>). Thus, there is no evidence that the T-tube is preventing bile leaks. There is also no evidence that the proportion of patients with serious morbidity or serious morbidity rates were different between the two groups. Long-term follow-up is necessary to detect any bile strictures and recurrence of common bile duct stones. There is no current evidence to suggest that these will be different between the groups.</P>
<P>Another reason for considering T-tube drainage is to extract any residual stones through the T-tube tract (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1994</LINK>). Even if patients develop symptomatic retained stones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic sphincterotomy can be used for the treatment. Before the advent of endoscopic sphincterotomy, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or open exploration were the only options available for the treatment of such patients. Although T-tube drainage to facilitate extraction of stones may have been appropriate in the past, this has become redundant with the currently available treatments.</P>
<P>The operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group. This is expected because the T-tube involves additional steps during surgery.</P>
<P>The post-operative hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than for the primary closure group. The patients were discharged home with the T-tube in situ in all three trials included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Leida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Geidie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">El-Geidie 2010</LINK>). So, the differences in the post-operative hospital stay cannot be explained by a delayed discharge for T-tube cholangiogram. While there was no significant difference in the serious morbidity rates between the two groups, this may be due to lack of evidence of effect rather than lack of effect. In the absence of any other explanation for the prolonged post-operative hospital stay, one has to conclude that the longer hospital stay in the T-tube group than primary closure group is due to higher morbidity.</P>
<P>The time taken to return to work was significantly longer in the T-tube group than for the primary closure group. This may be related to the presence of the T-tube itself which may discourage the patient to return to work or may be related to associated morbidity. As mentioned previously, lack of evidence of significant differences in serious morbidity should not be considered as evidence for lack of effect. The confidence intervals were wide and there is a possibility that this finding of lack of significant differences in serious morbidity rates could be because of lack of evidence of effect. Quality of life, another patient-oriented outcome, was not reported in any of the trials included in this review.</P>
<P>A longer post-operative hospital stay is neither beneficial to the patient (particularly in a private healthcare funding set-up) nor to the healthcare provider (particularly in a state-funded or insurance company funded healthcare funding set-up). In addition to the shorter hospital stay, the other cost-savings that can be made in the primary closure include the cost of the T-tube, increased operating time, the cost of T-tube cholangiogram, and the cost of removal of the T-tube. Unless these costs can be offset by decreased complications, the costs associated with the use of a T-tube cannot be justified. Based on the evidence from this review, this does not appear to be the case. Consequently, there appears to be little justification in the use of a T-tube after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.</P>
<P>It appears that T-tube use has a significant potential to harm the patients and increase the costs for the healthcare funder without any notable benefit based on the information obtained from the trials included in this review. There is additional corroborative information. We identified three non-randomised studies comparing T-tube with primary closure (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ha 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jameel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jameel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Noh 2009</LINK>) from the search strategy. None of the studies reported any biliary peritonitis (T-tube drainage: 0/26 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ha 2004</LINK>); 0/11 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Jameel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jameel 2008</LINK>); 0/33 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Noh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Noh 2009</LINK>) versus primary closure: 0/12 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ha 2004</LINK>); 0/48 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Jameel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jameel 2008</LINK>); 0/30 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Noh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Noh 2009</LINK>)). In addition, in another Cochrane review, which included 359 patients from six trials, we found that T-tube closure had longer operating time and hospital stay than primary closure of the common bile duct without stent after open common bile duct exploration, without affecting the serious morbidity rates significantly (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>). In that Cochrane review of T-tube drainage versus primary closure in patients undergoing open common bile duct exploration, fewer patients developed biliary complications requiring intervention (not statistically significant) (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>) as is the case with this review. The purpose of T-tube drainage is the same whether the patients undergo open or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Thus, there is a strong corroborative evidence that supports the findings of this review.</P>

</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-05 09:28:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Although the risk of bias in the included trials was high and the overall quality of evidence was very low, one has to put this into perspective. This is currently the best available evidence. The previous routine use of T-tube was based on clinical opinion and the fact that a significant proportion of the patients had to undergo major re-operations where stones were left in the bile duct. The advent of endoscopic sphincterotomy appears to have made the use of the T-tube redundant. The trials were at high risk of bias (for example, outcomes such as hospital stay and return to work can be biased because of lack of blinding and absence of any criteria for discharge from hospital or return to work, and a surgeon favouring primary closure might have discharged the patient from hospital earlier or might have advised the patient that he or she could return to work earlier) and new trials are necessary to assess whether T-tube drainage is better than primary closure after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, as shown by the trial sequential analysis. Until such new trials with low risk of bias show that T-tube use is safe and effective, the use of T-tube after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration should be confined to randomised clinical trials. Such randomised trials should include quality of life and return to work as these outcomes are useful to determine whether T-tube is beneficial to the patient and whether it is cost-effective.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-04-18 15:50:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We have followed the Cochrane methodology for performing the review. One potential bias was that we imputed the mean and standard deviation from median and other measures such as P values or inter-quartile ranges. This may have introduced an error in the effect estimate. The sensitivity analysis by excluding the trials in which the imputation was performed did not change the results. The alternative to this imputation is to present the information as presented by the authors, but the interpretation of that information can be even more confusing.</P>

<P>In the previous version of this review, we stated that we could not make any conclusions because of the data available at that time (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2007</LINK>). In this review, we advocate against the use of T-tube outside well-designed randomised clinical trials.</P>

<P>The protocol for the present review was published with the title 'T-tube drain in laparoscopic common bile duct stone exploration' (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2006</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between previous version and current version</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>T-tube drainage was changed to intervention, and primary closure was changed to control. This is because T-tube drainage contains additional steps in surgery as compared to primary closure.</LI>
<LI>The methods were updated according to version 5.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This involved changes of the outcomes and the risk of bias domains. This resulted in changes in the findings and conclusions of the review.</LI>
<LI>The intervention 'primary closure with biliary stent' was considered to be very different from 'primary closure without biliary stent'. Hence, the intervention 'primary closure with biliary stent' was excluded from the review. 'Primary closure with a biliary stent' should be considered in another review.</LI>
<LI>Trial sequential analysis was performed.</LI>

<P>
<B>Trial sequential analysis of serious morbidity</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 28,572 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 6.1%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 61.69%. After accruing 295 patients in the three trials, we have only reached 1.03% of the DARIS. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time</B>
<BR/>This figure shows that the accumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary during the second trial (see the dashed line). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 414 patients based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 2962, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. The results are compatible with significant reduction of operation time favouring the primary closure group without risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of duration of hospital stay</B>
<BR/>This figure shows that the accumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary during the second trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 724 patients based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of one day, a variance (VAR) of 23.04, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. The results are compatible with significant reduction of hospital stay favouring the primary closure group without risk of random errors.</P>
