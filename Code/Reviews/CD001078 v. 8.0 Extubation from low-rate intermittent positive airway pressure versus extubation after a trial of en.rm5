<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-01-18 11:59:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that time on endotracheal CPAP (continuous low pressure rather than intermittent breaths from the ventilator) before taking preterm babies off a ventilator helps them adjust to breathing on their own. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need help to breathe, sometimes via an endotracheal tube (through the windpipe) connected to a mechanical ventilator. It was thought that it might help a baby adjust to breathing after ventilation if there was a period of CPAP (continuous positive airways pressure) before extubation (coming off the ventilator). However, there have also been concerns that this may create too much work for the baby, and may cause harm. This review found that a trial of CPAP before extubation does not improve the baby's ability to breathe on their own.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-01-18 13:14:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Failure of extubation and subsequent reintubation may result in additional stress and trauma to the premature infant. Treating infants about to be extubated with a period of endotracheal CPAP has been suggested as a method of preparing for extubation. However, this process has been criticized as increasing the neonate's work of breathing and perhaps increasing the likelihood of extubation failure.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>In premature infants having their endotracheal tube removed, is direct extubation from low rate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) more successful than that following a period of endotracheal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-01-18 12:00:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in The Cochrane Library was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching mainly in the English language. These searches were updated in November 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials were included that used random or quasi-random allocation and compared extubation of premature infants following a period of endotracheal CPAP to direct extubation following IPPV.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by each author and synthesis of data using relative risk.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-01-18 13:14:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials were identified that compared extubation of premature infants following a period of endotracheal CPAP to direct extubation following IPPV. Direct extubation from low rate ventilation is associated with a trend towards an increased chance of successful extubation when compared to extubation after a period of endotracheal CPAP, [typical RR 0.45 (0.19, 1.07), typical RD -0.103 (-0.200, -0.006), NNT 10 (5, 167)]. When only truly randomized trials are considered, this result becomes both statistically significant and clinically important, [typical RR 0.10 (0.01, 0.78), typical RD -0.201 (-0.319, -0.083), NNT 5 (3, 12)]. Similar differences are seen for the secondary outcome, apnea.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Preterm infants no longer requiring endotracheal intubation and IPPV should be directly extubated without a trial of ETT CPAP.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-01-18 13:06:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) of infants with respiratory failure provides life-saving support until the underlying pulmonary pathology has resolved spontaneously or been successfully treated. Weaning of ventilatory support occurs during the resolution phase and when an infant is able to generate sufficient respiratory effort, the endotracheal tube (ETT) is removed.</P>
<P>Minimising the duration of endotracheal intubation is thought to reduce the risks of chronic lung disease, sepsis and upper airway trauma. A trial of endotracheal continuous positive airway pressure (ETT CPAP) prior to extubation to demonstrate the readiness of an infant to breath without IPPV has been advocated by Nugent and others (<LINK REF="REF-Nugent-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nugent 1988</LINK>). However, the same authors also suggest that in small infants the added dead space and resistance to gas flow imposed by the ETT may increase the work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Nugent-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nugent 1988</LINK>). Le Souef and others (<LINK REF="REF-LeSouef-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeSouef 1984</LINK>) demonstrated a substantial decrease in resistance of the respiratory system following extubation. They also showed that diaphragmatic activity was greater when an infant was on ETT CPAP and concluded that the presence of the ETT increased the work of breathing. <LINK REF="REF-Lopes-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 1981</LINK> suggested that diaphragmatic fatigue might precede the development of apnea in some infants.</P>
<P>Failure of extubation may be indicated by increasing rates of apnea and bradycardia, increasing oxygen requirements or respiratory acidosis. Failure of extubation and subsequent reintubation may result in additional stress and physical trauma to the infant. Maximising the likelihood of successful extubation is therefore an important goal.</P>
<P>Previous reviews suggest that factors such as the use of postextubation nasal CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997a</LINK>), the administration of methylxanthines (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1997</LINK>) and in some cases dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997b</LINK>) improve the likelihood of successful extubation. The use of these therapies has implications for this comparison of extubation from low rate vs. ETT CPAP.</P>

<P>In premature infants having their endotracheal tube removed, is direct extubation from low rate ventilation more successful than extubation following a period of endotracheal CPAP? Success was defined as avoidance of endotracheal reintubation for treatment of apnea/bradycardia, increasing oxygen requirements and respiratory acidosis.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned to determine whether there were any differences between the group as a whole and subgroups of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (infants &lt; 1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (infants &lt; 1000 g). Analysis according to level of CPAP used (less than 5 cm water vs. 5 cm or greater) was also planned if differences between studies existed.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was planned to investigate the role of potential confounding variables such as the use of postextubation NCPAP, methylxanthines and dexamethasone. Sensitivity analysis according to quality of trial was to be performed if differences existed.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-01-18 13:17:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using the search strategy described above, three clinical trials were identified that addressed the issue of whether extubation of infants directly from IPPV was more successful than extubation following a short period of endotracheal CPAP. In two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK>) the ETT CPAP group was designated as the control group. This convention is followed throughout this review. A full description of each study is included in the Table, Characteristics of Included Studies. No trials were excluded from the review and no ongoing trials were identified.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 1995</LINK> recruited infants less than 1250 g and 1500 g respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> excluded infants with size 2.5 ETTs and therefore enrolled a population that was both heavier (mean birthweight 1.93 kg) and more mature (mean gestational age 33 weeks). Almost all infants studied were treated prophylactically with aminophylline and all were weaned to minimal levels of IPPV before study commencement. Surfactant usage was confined to a small subgroup of babies recruited in the latter stages of the trial of Tapia. All three studies excluded infants with conditions that might make successful extubation less likely, e.g. neuromuscular disorders, patent ductus arteriosus, CNS depressant medication.</P>
<P>Following removal of their endotracheal tube, infants in the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK> were placed in headbox oxygen. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 1995</LINK> allocated infants to either headbox oxygen or nasal CPAP following direct extubation and to headbox only following ETT CPAP. The use of dexamethasone, either as a short course to facilitate extubation or as a longer course as treatment for chronic lung disease, is not recorded in any of the trials.</P>
<P>All three trials used low levels of ETT CPAP, ranging from as low as 2 cm water in the trial of Kim and Boutwell, to a maximum of 4 cm of water in the trial of Tapia.<BR/>
<BR/>The criteria for reintubation were similar across the studies. These included frequent apnea (greater than 2/hour for <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK> and greater than 3/hour for Tapia) or apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation and respiratory acidosis. Tapia had the additional indication for reintubation of the need for greater than 60% inspired oxygen concentration.<BR/>
<BR/>It was possible to derive the proportion of infants having clinically important apneic events, i.e. more frequently than 0.5/hour, in the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK>. This was not possible in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 1995</LINK> in which only the presence or absence of apnea was noted.</P>

<P>Three trials were identified that compared extubation of premature infants following a period of endotracheal CPAP to direct extubation following IPPV (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no disagreement between reviewers with respect to quality assessment done independently.</P>
<P>
<B>PRIMARY OUTCOME<BR/>EXTUBATION FAILURE (OUTCOMES 01.01 AND 01.04):</B>
<BR/>The use of a period of ETT CPAP prior to removal of the endotracheal tube confers no advantage over direct extubation. Using the summary statistic, typical relative risk (RR), there is a trend favouring direct extubation which does not reach statistical significance 0.45 (0.19, 1.07); however, the typical risk difference (RD) shows a significant difference of -0.10 (-0.20, -0.006) giving a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (5, 167). When the quasi-randomized trial of Tapia is excluded, a statistically significant benefit of direct extubation is observed: typical RR 0.10 (0.01, 0.78), typical RD -0.20 (-0.32, -0.08) and NNT 5 (3, 12).</P>
<P>
<B>SECONDARY OUTCOMES<BR/>EXTUBATION FAILURE (EXTUBATED TO HEADBOX) (OUTCOME 01.02):</B>
<BR/>Sub-analysis on the basis of care received after removal of the endotracheal tube shows that the benefits of direct extubation are sustained when extubation is to headbox oxygen - typical RR 0.21 (0.06.0.72), typical RD -0.15 (-0.25, -0.06), NNT 7 (4, 18).</P>
<P>
<B>EXTUBATION FAILURE (EXTUBATED TO NCPAP) (OUTCOME 01.03):</B>
<BR/>There were no trials in which both groups were managed with NCPAP after removal of the endotracheal tube. There is no difference between direct extubation and ETT CPAP groups when the direct extubation group only is managed with NCPAP. This result should be interpreted with caution given that the same trial of Tapia was the "outlier" in the meta-analysis of trials evaluating the usefulness of post-extubation NCPAP (Davis and Henderson-Smart) which concluded that NCPAP was more effective than headbox oxygen.</P>
<P>
<B>APNEA (OUTCOMES (01.05 AND 01.06):</B>
<BR/>The use of ETT CPAP is associated with a trend towards increased frequency of apnea when all three trials are considered. Exclusion of the trial by Tapia on the basis of quality again leads to this result achieving statistical significance: typical RR 0.15 (0.03, 0.77), typical RD -0.20 (-0.34, -0.07), NNT 5 (3, 15).</P>
<P>Planned subgroup analysis on the basis of the level of ETT CPAP applied (high or low) was not performed because all trials used a pressure less than 5 cm water.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-01-18 13:11:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of a trial of ETT CPAP, at pressures of 2 to 4 cm water, as the final stage of weaning ventilator rate prior to extubation is not supported by this meta-analysis. Successful extubation is more likely if infants are extubated directly from a low rate of IPPV. Physiological reasons for this result have been mentioned previously. When small infants breathe through endotracheal tubes with narrow diameters, airway resistance and therefore work of breathing increase to a point where spontaneous respirations are unable to be sustained. It is possible that higher levels of CPAP might be more effective but there are no data available to evaluate this.<BR/>
<BR/>The potential confounding variables, use of methylxanthines and postnatal steroids, were not able to be assessed because of the almost universal usage of the former and lack of usage of the latter. Nasal CPAP has been shown in a previous review to be effective in facilitating extubation. Its impact on the question posed in the current review is not able to be determined. The two trials that were truly randomized did not use NCPAP for post-extubation care and the quasi-randomized trial of Tapia used this method of treatment only for infants directly extubated from IPPV.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis on the basis of birthweight is not possible using the published data from these trials. However inferences may be drawn on the basis of the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1987</LINK>. The former trial enrolled only infants with a size 2.5 mm endotracheal tube and the latter excluded these infants and enrolled only infants having 3.0 and 3.5 mm diameter tubes. Since choice of size of endotracheal tube is influenced mainly by weight these trials provide information relevant to the question of whether the effect of ETT CPAP differs according to weight of the neonate. It appears that ETT CPAP is more strongly associated with adverse outcomes in smaller infants (with smaller endotracheal tubes) than it is in larger infants.</P>
<P>ETT CPAP may have other uses in ventilated newborn infants. In order to determine readiness for extubation, ETT CPAP was used to assess spontaneous respiratory effort prior to removal of the ETT. Measurement of spontaneous breathing performance during a brief (3 to 10 minutes) period of ETT CPAP was shown to be useful in predicting the likelihood of successful extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Kamlin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamlin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2003</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Premature infants no longer requiring endotracheal intubation and IPPV should be directly extubated without a period of ETT CPAP.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials may address the issue of whether higher levels of ETT CPAP are useful in this situation.</P>
