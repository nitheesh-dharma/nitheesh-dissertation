<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 21:40:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>People with sickle cell disease are particularly prone to pneumococcal infection, which may be fatal. Children aged up to 23 months are at high risk, but usual polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines may not work in this age group. New conjugate pneumococcal vaccines may help to reduce the rate of infection in people with sickle cell disease of all ages. We searched for trials which compared a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine schedule with a different schedule or no vaccination in people with sickle cell disease. The review includes five trials with a total of 547 participants. One trial showed that the polysaccharide vaccine did not reduce the risk of infection very much in children younger than three years old, but it was linked with only minor adverse events. Three trials of conjugate vaccines showed increased antibody responses compared to control groups in people of all ages, although clinical outcomes were not measured in these trials. This review did not show if the vaccines prevent infection or decrease death rates. We recommend that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are used in people with sickle cell disease. Randomised trials will be needed to determine the best vaccination schedule when further, potentially more effective vaccines become available. Such trials should measure clinical outcomes of effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with sickle cell disease are particularly susceptible to pneumococcal infection, which may be fatal.

New conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are now available, which may help to reduce the incidence of infection in people with sickle cell disease. </P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.

<P>Date of most recent search of Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 December 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine regimen with a different regimen or no vaccination in people with sickle cell disease. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials were identified in the searches and five trials, with a total of 547 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Only one trial reported incidence of pneumococcal infection, and this demonstrated that the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine used (PPV14) failed to reduce significantly the risk of infection in children under three years of age, but was associated with only minor adverse events. Three trials of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines found that antibody responses were increased compared to control groups, including those in infants, although clinical outcomes were not measured in these trials. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-12 13:43:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Previous trials have shown that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are safe and effective in normal healthy individuals, including those under the age of two years. The controlled trials included in this review have demonstrated immunogenicity (the ability to induce the body's immune response, without which there is no protection) of these vaccines, and observational studies in people with sickle cell disease support these findings. We therefore recommend that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are used in people with sickle cell disease. Randomised trials in people with sickle cell disease will be needed to determine the optimal vaccination regimen when further, potentially more effective vaccines become available. Such trials should measure clinical outcomes of effectiveness. The trials included in this review were published between 1983 and 2003. We have not identified any further relevant trials up to December 2011. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-23 21:45:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 21:43:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell anaemia (Haemoglobin SS) is a common genetic disorder in Africa, the Mediterranean, parts of India and the Middle East, as well as amongst peoples originating from these areas such as the black populations of the Caribbean, USA and Europe. In certain African countries the gene frequency is greater than 20% and it is up to 20% in certain regions of Saudi Arabia and India (<LINK REF="REF-Flint-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flint 1993</LINK>). The term sickle cell disease (SCD) is used to cover all sickling syndromes with chronic haemolytic anaemia and vaso-occlusive disease. This includes compound heterozygous disorders including Haemoglobin SC disease (SC), sickle beta thalassaemia (Sßthal) and sickle beta 0 thalassaemia (Sß0thal), as well as the homozygous disease (SS). Morbidity and mortality in SCD mainly results from tissue infarction, secondary to microvascular obstruction by sickle cells. Painful bone infarcts occur commonly and acute chest syndrome (with pain, fever and hypoxia), cerebro-vascular accident and splenic sequestration syndrome can also occur.</P>
<P>Infection, an important cause of sudden death in SCD, particularly in early childhood, plays a prominent role in precipitating acute chest syndrome and may also play a role in the other events. Episodes of infection are likely to be a consequence of functional asplenia which develops almost invariably in sickle cell anaemia. It also occurs in compound heterozygous disorders, although in these it is not invariable and its onset tends to be later (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 1983</LINK>). By two years of age, half of the people with SCD who have been tested have functional asplenia (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1985</LINK>). In addition, a humoral immunodeficiency has been described in people with SCD, as a result of defective activation of the alternative pathway of complement (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winkelstein-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winkelstein 1968</LINK>) associated with low levels of anti-pneumococcal antibody and leading to deficient opsonisation of pneumococci (<LINK REF="REF-Bjornson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjornson 1987</LINK>). This defect has been reported to be overcome by the addition of serotype specific anti-pneumococcal antibody (<LINK REF="REF-Bjornson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjornson 1981</LINK>). Subtle defects of cellular immune responses might also play a role, as falling numbers of circulating CD4+CD45RA+ cells have been described in people without sickle cell disease who have undergone post-traumatic splenectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pneumococcus is a commonly isolated pathogen in people with SCD with bacteremia, pneumonia or meningitis or both (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>). It was the most frequent organism isolated in fatal events associated with infection, in children with SCD under the age of five years in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Zarkowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarkowsky 1986</LINK>). Penicillin prophylaxis from infancy is recommended practice in SCD (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 1996</LINK>), but compliance is poor even where there are adequate resources. Penicillin resistance amongst pneumococcal strains is an increasing problem. In certain regions of the USA, approximately 35% of isolates have reduced susceptibility or resistance to penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1997</LINK>). In England and Wales, penicillin resistant blood isolates rose from 0.54% in 1990 to 3.67% in 1999; the corresponding figures for erythromycin resistance being 4.96% and 11.36% (<LINK REF="REF-Reacher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reacher 2000</LINK>). Thirty-three per cent of children with SCD under two years of age living in Louisiana (93% were on penicillin prophylaxis) were colonised with pneumococcus and 85% of the strains isolated were penicillin resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Steele-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 21:45:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Pneumococcal vaccination has been used to protect children and adults with SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Ammann-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammann 1977</LINK>). The polyvalent polysaccharide vaccines have been reported as not effective in children under two years of age, which is the period of highest risk (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overturf-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overturf 1982</LINK>). Furthermore, re-immunisation with booster doses of polysaccharide vaccine produced relatively poor responses in older children (<LINK REF="STD-Bjornson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bjornson 1996</LINK>). Conjugate vaccines, in which polysaccharides are covalently linked to protein carriers, are effective in healthy children in this age group, and protective antibody responses may not require the presence of a functioning spleen (<LINK REF="REF-Breukels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breukels 2001</LINK>). A 7-valent protein conjugate vaccine (PCV7), directed against seven serotypes commonly associated with invasive disease, has been shown to have efficacy in preventing pneumococcal disease in healthy children under two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eskola-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eskola 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klugman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>) and children with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Klugman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 2003</LINK>). It has also been shown to be immunogenic (increasing antibody responses) in children with SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). PCV7 has been licensed and recommended for universal usage in infants, since February 2000, in the United States. A recent report on post-licensure surveillance suggests that this vaccine is generally well tolerated but continued surveillance for potential adverse reactions is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Wise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wise 2004</LINK>). Serotype prevalence studies in Pennsylvania (<LINK REF="REF-Alpern-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alpern 2001</LINK>) and Scotland (<LINK REF="REF-Kyaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyaw 2000</LINK>) showed 97.5% and 84% respectively of children under two years of age had disease caused by serotypes included in PCV7. Similar results were found in national studies in the USA and UK (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleeman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleeman 2001</LINK>), although only 41% of pneumococcal infections in children in Malawi would be covered by the serotypes included in the 7-valent vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2003</LINK>), compared to 66% in the 9-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2003</LINK>). The coverage decreases with age, reaching 58% in the people over the age of 65 years in the Scottish study (<LINK REF="REF-Kyaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyaw 2000</LINK>). Nine and eleven valent conjugate vaccines, currently under development, should increase coverage, though warning notes have been signalled that there might be a shift towards non-vaccine serotypes causing disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pelton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>As far as antibiotic resistance is concerned, PCV7 currently covers most of the antibiotic resistant strains in different countries (<LINK REF="REF-Hudspeth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudspeth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joloba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joloba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergnaud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergnaud 2001</LINK>), including those causing invasive disease in children with sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Adamkiewicz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamkiewicz 2003</LINK>), although this might change in the future.</P>

<P>First authors of published trials were contacted to ask if they knew of other ongoing or recently completed trials. The appropriate vaccine manufacturers were also contacted to identify any remaining published or unpublished randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices was contacted to inquire if updated relevant clinical trial information was available since the publication of their last recommendations in October 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-09-23 21:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors (CH, EGD) independently assessed the methodological quality of each trial. The authors assessed methodological quality of included trials with particular emphasis on allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, double blinding and method of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). They ranked allocation concealment using the Cochrane approach: Grade A: adequate concealment; Grade B: uncertain; Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment; Grade D: not used (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>). Where there was uncertainty the authors contacted the primary investigators for clarification. The authors also recorded the source of funding for each trial. If disagreement arose on the suitability of a trial for inclusion in the review, the authors attempted to reach a consensus through discussion.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-09-23 22:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>For dichotomous variables the authors calculated an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for individual studies. The authors pooled all similar studies using an OR and 95% CIs. They also log transformed geometric means and 95% CI of antibody titres to approximate means and standard deviations for analysis using a method recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>). For continuous variables, the authors calculated a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for each outcome. </P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:55:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>For cross-over trials, we have used the least-preferred option as described by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Therefore, we have ignored the cross-over design and treated the results from the first period as if they came from one group of participants and results from the second period as if they came from a different group of participants. This is a conservative approach and ignores the within-participant correlation. The same participants appear in both arms of the study and so they are not independent of each other, as required in the standard statistical method.</P>

<P>Five trials, with a total of 547 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). Consultation with relevant pharmaceutical companies as well as bibliographic references of included studies, failed to identify any further eligible trials.</P>
<P>A study by John randomised 242 Jamaican SS children, aged six months to three years, to one of four treatment groups: either prophylactic penicillin or not, combined with either <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>type B (Hib) or 14-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV14) (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Group allocations are described in an additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Children with a previous history of pneumococcal infection or splenectomy were excluded. The choice of age group may have been poor in order to demonstrate efficacy, since polysaccharide vaccines are reported to be ineffective in children under the age of two years (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1996</LINK>). The study lasted five years. A misprint in the primary publication made treatment group numbers difficult to establish, as the numbers given do not add up to the study cohort. However, the authors were contacted and the numbers confirmed (37 in the group receiving Hib vaccine alone, rather than 27 as printed). The research was funded by the Medical Research Council (UK), and vaccines were donated by the manufacturer, Merck Sharpe and Dohme (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rigau-Perez studied adverse reactions to booster PPV14 in 32 people with SCD aged 3 years to 24 years attending a Californian sickle cell clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>). This study was the only cross-over study included in the review. Sixteen people with SCD were randomised to receive PPV14 first, and 16 to receive placebo (an identically packaged saline injection) first. There was a wash-out period of a month, after which the groups switched over to the other treatment. Adverse reactions were recorded up to one week after each injection, and the number of adverse reactions after the booster vaccine was compared to placebo. The source of funding was not reported. A prior section of this study examined adverse reactions and anti-pneumococcal titres after primary and booster vaccinations (<LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>). However, this comparison was not randomised, and is thus excluded from this review.</P>
<P>The Vernacchio study compared two different vaccination schedules: 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) alone (n = 12) or preceded by two doses of 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PCV7) (n = 11) (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). Follow up at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after each injection looked for adverse reactions such as fever or local reaction. Serum samples were taken immediately before and three to six weeks after vaccination. These were analysed for serotype specific antibody levels (to five serotypes: 1, 6B, 15, 19F, 23F) and antibody affinity (to three serotypes: 1, 6B, 14). Participants who had received pneumococcal vaccine in the previous two years were not eligible for inclusion. Twenty-three participants with SCD aged over two years were recruited from a children's hospital in the USA and followed up. This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (USA).</P>
<P>The earlier Goldblatt study is presently only published in abstract form and was identified through contact with experts in the field. This study compared three different vaccination regimens, with 50 Ghanaian infants with SCD in each group (children aged up to 23 months, mean age 13.7 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>). The children received either 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or Hib vaccine, followed eight weeks later by either PCV9 or PPV23, as detailed in an additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Immune response, measured from serum samples by antibodies to the vaccine serotypes, was recorded after the second vaccine. The trial was funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldblatt-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldblatt 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The later Goldblatt study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>), which did not include the same participants as the earlier one (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>), is also currently only published in abstract form and was identified through contact with experts in the field. This study compared four different vaccination regimens in 100 Ghanaian infants with SS (n = 25 in each group). Participants were identified at birth from routine screening and recruited at ages between 4 to 16 weeks. The four vaccination regimens are shown in an additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and included combinations of vaccination at four time points with PCV9, PPV23 vaccine and Hib vaccine. Side effects were reported up to seven days after each vaccination. Serotype specific pneumococcal antibodies (against all nine serotypes) were analysed at four time-points: before first vaccination, four weeks after third vaccination, at 52 weeks (before booster) and four weeks after the booster. This trial was also funded by DFID (<LINK REF="REF-Goldblatt-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldblatt 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies reported different vaccination regimens, often using combinations of polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. The study results cannot, therefore, be pooled, and are presented according to the vaccination regimens compared in each study.</P>

<P>The study by John was described as randomised, although the specific method of randomisation was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). Blinding was not reported. Full baseline data for participant characteristics were not given. Allocation concealment was not described, and is therefore graded as unclear. Group allocation was changed after randomisation for convenience (for example, rural participants being unable to attend clinic regularly for penicillin injections). This protocol change influenced whether or not participants received penicillin (16 participants changed group), but did not affect allocation of vaccine. Twenty-three participants who withdrew from the trial prior to treatment were not included in the analyses. There were 25 withdrawals after the trial start, 20 due to splenectomy, four due to emigration and one because of recurrent meningitis. These participants were analysed according to allocated groups until they dropped out. There were also seven participants who deviated from the protocol, and these were analysed according to intention-to-treat. </P>

(<LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>). In the randomised analysis, allocation concealment was performed, the interventions were identically packaged in the hospital pharmacy where treatment codes were kept and allocation concealment was therefore graded as adequate.

<P>After the final vaccination, Vernacchio reported fever in four participants in the PPV23+PCV7 group, compared to two in the group receiving only PPV23, OR 2.57 (95% CI 0.36 to 18.33), showing no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). The wide confidence intervals and lack of significance reflect the low power of the study. Participants in the PPV23+PCV7 group, however, had received two injections more than the PPV23 group, with a total of four additional episodes of fever. These data are not included in quantitative analysis in this review, as this could result in including the same participant more than once in analysis, which may bias results. It should be noted, however, that a greater number of injections increases the risk of adverse events.</P>
<P>Vernacchio also measured a local reaction score, consisting of a cumulated score of redness, swelling and pain (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). The authors reported no significant difference in the local reaction score after the PPV23 vaccination although, as with fever, the PCV7 group were subject to more injections and, therefore, a higher risk of local reactions.</P>

Both PCV9 (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>) and PPV23 (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>) boosters had significantly improved immunogenicity for almost all serotypes, compared to Hib booster. The only exception was serotype 19F, MD -0.49 (95% CI -1.76 to 0.78). There was a significantly raised immune response with PPV23 compared to PCV9 booster for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 9V and 23F, but not 6B, 14, 18C or 19F (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the later Goldblatt trial there were two deaths in the group receiving the PCV9 regimen plus Hib booster (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>). Neither death was related to pneumococcal infection, one being due to severe anaemia and the second due to malaria. Very wide confidence intervals indicate lack of statistical power due to the low number of events, and the result could be due to chance rather than a true effect.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified trials of three main pneumococcal vaccine schedules: polyvalent polysaccharide vaccines (PPV), polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCV), and a combination of both. </P>
<P>PPV14, used in the Rigau-Perez and John trials has been reported to be most useful in children over the age of two years (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>), due to an inherent immaturity of the immune response in younger children (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overturf-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overturf 1982</LINK>). This review did not show evidence of effectiveness of this vaccine for preventing pneumococcal infections in children, possibly because the included participants in the John study were under the age of three years (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). An increased risk of (minor) adverse events was noted for PPV14 when compared to Hib vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>) and saline injections (<LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>), but no serious or unexpected adverse events were reported. Interpretation of the results of these trials must take into account their methodological flaws. In particular, changes in group allocation and protocol during the John trial weakens randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>) and neither study undertook an intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, the Rigau-Perez study was cross-over in design and care should be taken when interpreting these results as the method of analysing these cross-over data, including participants for both study arms, is the one which has been described by Elbourne, to be the least robust of the possible alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>In a trial of 23 children over two years old, immune response was compared between a schedule of PPV23 alone and with PPV23 preceded at eight-week intervals by two doses of PCV7 (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). This trial reported significantly increased immunogenicity for serotypes 14 and 19F, and although the difference was non-significant for the other serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 18C and 23F), there was a marked positive trend (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). The poor methodological quality and small sample size of this trial, however, mean that the findings should be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>Two well-conducted trials in children under the age of two with sickle cell disease found that PCV-9 induced a significantly greater immune response than control (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>). Data describing antibody responses to pneumococcal seroptypes in infants (mean age 2.2 months) showed that the most effective regimen was three doses of PCV9 (at 6, 10 and 12 weeks) followed by a PPV23 booster (at 52 weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>). An earlier trial by Goldblatt, in slightly older children (mean age 13.7 months) receiving PCV9, Hib and PPV23 regimens, found that PCV9 induced relevant serotype-specific antibodies compared to no response after Hib vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>). Goldblatt also demonstrated a priming effect to the relevant pneumococcal antigens (meaning that immunological memory is created, so that subsequent exposure should produce an exaggerated booster response, not found when pure polysaccharide vaccines are used alone) (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>). Goldblatt did not find a significant difference in participants receiving two doses of PCV9 and those receiving PCV9 followed by PPV23 (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>). These are the trial author's conclusions only, as full data are not yet available for the earlier Goldblatt study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>) for analysis in this review. When available, we plan to incorporate full data in a future update of this review. </P>
<P>There were no withdrawals from the trial of PCV7 (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). However, only 23 out of 181 (12%) eligible people opted to take part. This may reflect the level of acceptance of a three-injection vaccination compared to a single injection vaccination schedule, and could have implications for compliance. In addition, immunogenic benefits must be balanced against increased, though minor, adverse events due to more injections with this schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). In the USA, where over 23 million doses of this vaccine have been distributed (<LINK REF="REF-Pelton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelton 2002</LINK>), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has noted an incidence of 1 seizure per 7000 doses (not proven to be vaccine-related), which is lower than for other comparable vaccines. Two cases of encephalitis have occurred, but causation is unclear, and no other serious adverse reactions have been linked to PCV7. </P>
<P>A randomised, double-blind trial of 37,868 healthy children (without sickle cell disease) under the age of two years found, in intention-to-treat analysis that PCV7 was effective in significantly reducing incidence of pneumococcal infection in vaccinated children, with an efficacy of over 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>). A South African trial of around 40,000 infants with and without HIV infection reported a significant reduction in pneumococcal infection in all vaccinated groups (<LINK REF="REF-Klugman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 2003</LINK>). Rigorous observational studies in children with sickle cell disease have also found them to be safe, and to increase antibody responses to pneumococcal serotypes (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the USA, vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is now recommended as part of the normal infant immunisation schedule, including people with sickle cell disease. In the UK, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recently agreed in principle to its introduction to the routine immunisation schedule for children subject to a number of conditions including consideration of the number and timing of doses to protect children (<LINK REF="REF-JCVI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">JCVI 2004</LINK>). In the meantime, the Chief Medical Officer (<LINK REF="REF-CMO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMO 2002</LINK>) and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (<LINK REF="REF-RCPCH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPCH 2002</LINK>) recommend vaccination of high-risk groups for pneumococcal infection, such as those with sickle cell disease. An empirical schedule of dosage recommendations for use of the PCV7 has been published by Finn and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Finn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finn 2002</LINK>). In infants, this starts as early as two months of age and comprises three doses at one to two month intervals, followed by a booster PPV23 at 24 months for at risk children. Other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, including 11 and 13 valent varieties, are currently under development. These vaccines may be helpful in the vaccination of infants, and provide protection against more serotypes which may be particularly relevant in African countries to cover more of the predominant disease causing serotypes. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-12 13:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Only one trial reported the clinical outcome of pneumococcal infection incidence (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>). This trial found no significant reduction in pneumococcal infections in children who received PPV14 aged between six months and three years. Trials also found that this vaccine was associated with minor adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-John-1984" TYPE="STUDY">John 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigau_x002d_Perez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rigau-Perez 1983</LINK>). These findings do not support the use of this vaccine in this young age group.</P>
<P>Conjugate pneumococcal vaccines were assessed in three trials. One trial, investigating use of PCV7, found increased immunogenicity but also increased minor adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Vernacchio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vernacchio 1998</LINK>). In addition, two trials found PCV9 to be immunogenic in young children and infants with sickle cell disease, particularly when used with a booster of PPV23 (<LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldblatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Goldblatt 2003a</LINK>). The most immunogenic schedule was three doses of PCV9 6, 10 and 12 weeks followed by a PPV23 booster at 52 weeks. No serious or unexpected adverse reactions were reported. These trials did not measure clinical outcomes such as incidence of pneumococcal infection and there is a complete lack of such data from randomised controlled trials at present.</P>
<P>Large randomised controlled trials in healthy infants and those with HIV under the age of two have found a reduction in risk of pneumococcal infection with conjugate vaccines (PCV) (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klugman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 2003</LINK>), and observational studies have found it to be safe and immunogenic in children with sickle cell disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). Although this review has not identified definitive pragmatic data regarding the effect of PCV on risk of pneumococcal infection, extrapolation of previous research suggests that this vaccine be used, with caution, in accordance with the recommendations of relevant health authorities, until further research has confirmed the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this population, and the optimal vaccination schedule.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were published between 1983 and 2003. We have not identified any further relevant trials up to December 2011. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large, well-conducted, multicentre trials of pneumococcal vaccinations in children and adults with sickle cell disease are urgently required, to investigate the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing incidence of pneumococcal infection, and to provide further information on the optimal schedules and safety of the vaccines. The evidence of efficacy and safety of the conjugate vaccine from the randomised studies in healthy normal children is, however, sufficiently powerful to preclude a placebo controlled trial specifically in children with sickle cell disease less than two years of age. In this group, a study aimed at identifying the optimal immunisation regimen would be valuable and should include an assessment of the role of combined PCV and PPV vaccination schedules and the role for newer PCVs with increased valency. </P>
