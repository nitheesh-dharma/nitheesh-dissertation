<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In many countries MS is the most common neurological disorder among young adults. Its impact can be overwhelming with the person facing the likelihood of reduced physical function and of disability, with consequent disruptions in education, employment, sexual and family functioning, friendships and activities of daily living. MS can have a considerable impact on the individual's sense of self, especially if they can no longer perform previously valued activities. Unpleasant side effects from medication may also occur. Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety are common in people with MS, and are often a result of finding it difficult to adjust to, and cope with, having the disorder. Cognitive functioning (the mental processes of memory, concentration, reasoning and judgement) can also be affected. Therefore a diagnosis of MS can have substantial psychological consequences.</P>
<P>The authors of this review wanted to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions (such as those addressing cognitive functioning, thoughts, mood and behaviour) for people with MS. This was done by considering their effect on quality of life, mood, cognitive functioning and disability in particular, but also on pain, fatigue, and use of other health related services and treatments.</P>
<P>Sixteen relevant studies were identified and included in this review. They have researched a variety of different interventions, having different purposes, and so a single overall definite conclusion cannot be made. However the authors cautiously conclude that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a therapy that addresses thoughts and behaviours, can help people with MS adjust to, and cope with, having MS, and can help them if they get depressed.</P>
<P>Psychological interventions can potentially help people with MS in many ways, including the management of symptoms such as pain and fatigue. Additional studies are needed, particularly those that include larger numbers of people.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The unpredictable, variable nature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and the possibility of increasing disability, means that a diagnosis can have substantial psychological consequences. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with MS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:21:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group Specialised Register (December 2004), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004 ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), PsychINFO (January 1887 to December 2004), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2004) and 14 others. We searched reference lists of articles, wrote to corresponding authors of the 13 papers identified by June 2004, and searched for trials in progress using 3 research registers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of interventions described as wholly or mostly based on psychological theory and practice, in people with MS. Primary outcome measures were disease specific and general quality of life, psychiatric symptoms, psychological functioning, disability, and cognitive outcomes. Secondary outcome measures were number of relapses, pain, fatigue, health care utilisation, changes in medication, and adherence to other therapies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Pertinent studies were identified from abstracts by one author. Full papers were independently compared to selection criteria by four authors. Key details were extracted from relevant papers using a standard format, and studies scored on three dimensions of quality. The review is organised into four mini-reviews (MR) dependent on the intervention's target population; people with cognitive impairments (MR1), people with moderate to severe disability (MR2), people with MS (no other criteria) (MR3), and people with depression (MR4).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Overall 16 studies were identified and included. MR1: three trials (n=145). Some evidence of effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive outcomes, although this was difficult to interpret because of the large number of outcome measures used. MR2: three trials (n=80). One small trial suggesting psychotherapy may help with depression. MR3: seven studies (n=688). Some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may help people adjust to, and cope with, having MS (three trials). The other trials were diverse in nature and some difficult to interpret because of multiple outcome measures. MR4: three trials (n=93). Two small studies of cognitive behavioural therapy showed significant improvements in depression.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The diversity of psychological interventions identified indicates the many ways in which they can potentially help people with MS. No definite conclusions can be made from this review. However there is reasonable evidence that cognitive behavioural approaches are beneficial in the treatment of depression, and in helping people adjust to, and cope with, having MS.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-15 12:11:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:49:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder among young adults and affects approximately 85 000 people in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2002</LINK>). It is a chronic and often disabling disease that typically commences between the ages of 20 and 40 years. It is more common in females than males by a ratio of approximately 3:2. The cause and early development of the disease are not fully understood but the current belief is that it is an autoimmune disorder affecting genetically susceptible individuals, possibly triggered by environmental or other factors. MS is characterised by inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system. Virtually all functions innervated by the CNS can be affected. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, loss of function or feeling in limbs, loss of bowel or bladder control, sexual dysfunction, debilitating fatigue, blindness due to optic neuritis, loss of balance, pain, cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001a</LINK>). There is currently no cure and only minimal symptomatic relief available.</P>
<P>MS is a disease with an unpredictable course and prognosis is difficult to predict. Three basic types of clinical course of MS can be distinguished:</P>
<P>1. Relapse-remitting MS is characterised by stable phases alternated with relapses. Relapses tend to be unpredictable and their causes are unclear. They can last for hours, days, weeks or months and vary from mild to severe. During a relapse new symptoms may occur or previous symptoms may return. Remissions can last as long as several years. Approximately 25% of people with MS have this form of the disease.</P>
<P>2. Secondary progressive MS commences with an initial relapse remitting course but is then followed by a progressive phase which is characterised by a steadily worsening condition. Approximately 40% of people with MS develop the secondary form, usually about 15 to 20 years after the initial onset of MS.</P>
<P>3. In the case of primary progressive MS there is no distinct pattern of relapses and remissions. The disease commences with steadily worsening symptoms and progressive disability which may level off or continue to deteriorate. Approximately 15% of people with MS have this form of the disease.</P>
<P>In addition to the course of MS these types of MS differ on a number of characteristics such as age at onset, degree of disability, disease duration and progression rate. As MS advances, the nature and severity of an individual's symptoms become increasingly heterogeneous. Some may experience few exacerbations of the illness whereas others may experience a rapid decline of function and eventually become wheelchair dependent. Similarly, while some individuals may experience minimal cognitive impairment, in others there may be severe decline.</P>
<P>PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS</P>
<P>A diagnosis of MS has profound social and psychological consequences. Because MS usually strikes individuals in their most productive years its impact can be overwhelming (<LINK REF="REF-Scheinberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinberg 1984</LINK>). The unpredictable and variable nature of MS may make it particularly difficult to come to terms with. The individual is firstly faced with the impact of receiving a diagnosis of a disease which is chronic, has an unpredictable course and affects many spheres of functioning. They face the likelihood of reduced physical function and disability in the future. Disruptions in education, employment, sexual and family functioning, friendships and activities of daily living are likely to occur. The unpredictability of day-to-day health in relapse remitting MS may greatly impinge upon quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Mullins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullins 2001</LINK>). Individuals may, in addition, experience unpleasant side effects from medication.</P>
<P>MS can have a considerable impact on the individual's sense of self (<LINK REF="REF-LaRocca-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRocca 1993</LINK>). Physical changes and functional limitations may lead to a sense of loss of identity or role strain especially when the individual can no longer perform previously valued activities (<LINK REF="REF-Mullins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullins 2001</LINK>). It may be necessary to redefine one's self-image in order to incorporate the limitations imposed by MS. Each time the individual experiences a new loss of function this sense of loss may be renewed (<LINK REF="REF-LaRocca-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRocca 1993</LINK>). Because of increasing disability, individuals with MS may have problems with isolation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1989</LINK>), perceived social support (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>), and social contacts (<LINK REF="REF-Gilchrist-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilchrist 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McIvor-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIvor 1984</LINK>). Loss of social support and/or social role has also been shown to be associated with depression (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The individual's perceptions of the uncertainty and variability of the disease and the perceived intrusiveness on daily activities are all related to depression and adjustment to the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Mullins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullins 2001</LINK>). Although illness related factors (such as neurological deterioration and functional disability) may partially contribute to how well the person with MS adjusts, the psychological response to the highly stressful nature of this disease is also likely to be important.</P>
<P>Individuals with MS exhibit a higher prevalence of mood disorders relative to individuals with comparable degrees of physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Minden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schiaffino-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiaffino 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schubert-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubert 1993</LINK>). Mood disorders refer to a "sustained and pervasive emotion that influences perception of self, others and the world such as depression or anxiety" (<LINK REF="REF-Minden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 2000</LINK>). Research has tended to focus on depression; however people with MS have also been found to have high levels of anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Maurelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurelli 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression is one of the more common and debilitating psychological symptoms in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>). Lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is approximately 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadovnick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadovnick 1991</LINK>). Point prevalence estimates are less clear, ranging from 14% to 57% depending on the assessment instrument, criteria, and patient samples used (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schubert-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubert 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surridge-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surridge 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 1980</LINK>). Rates of depression are higher than in other chronic illness (<LINK REF="REF-Minden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surridge-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surridge 1969</LINK>) or neurological disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Rabins-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabins 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 1980</LINK>). The high prevalence of depression in MS may have multiple aetiologies (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001a</LINK>) including psychosocial factors such as loss of social support or social role (<LINK REF="REF-Barnwell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnwell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilchrist-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilchrist 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulick 1997</LINK>) and inadequate coping (<LINK REF="REF-Aikens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aikens 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pakenham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakenham 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pakenham-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakenham 1999</LINK>). It may also be a concomitant of immune dysregulation associated with MS exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Dalos-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalos 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fassbender-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fassbender 1998</LINK>) and the development of brain lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin--1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pujol-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pujol 1997</LINK>). Thus depression can be both a complication associated with MS as well as a symptom of MS. The psychoneuroimmunology literature suggests that depression may induce abnormalities of immune functions that are relevant to MS (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001b</LINK>). There is also evidence (albeit equivocal) for depression being an iatrogenic side effect of MS disease-modifying drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1999a</LINK>). Another complicating factor is that many of the symptoms of depression are confounded with MS (e.g. fatigue, psychomotor agitation or retardation, changes in sleep patterns and diminished ability to concentrate). Thus the relationship of mood disorders to MS is multi-factorial and complex, and the extent to which they are direct consequences of the disease process itself or psychological reactions to it remains unclear. Such issues have important implications for the therapeutic approach that is adopted.</P>
<P>The relationship between medical and psychological variables is likely to be complex: The psychological state of an individual may affect their adherence to medical regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1996</LINK>), thereby exerting an indirect effect on disease processes. Psychological states may also directly affect MS. Stress arising from interpersonal conflict and disruption in routine can increase the likelihood of developing new brain lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2002</LINK>) and depression may increase MS related auto-immune activity (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1999b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Literature on other emotional problems in people with MS is scarce. Although it is recognised that in addition to depression, emotional responses such as anxiety and anger can occur, much less research has been undertaken in these aspects of psychological functioning. Existing research suggests that the point prevalence of problems with anxiety ranges from 19% to 34% (<LINK REF="REF-Minden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pepper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepper 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenager-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenager 1994</LINK>). A study by Feinstein (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1999</LINK>) found anxiety to be more common than depression. Co-morbid anxiety and depression was associated with elevated rates of suicidal ideation compared to depressed patients with little or no anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>COGNITIVE FACTORS</P>
<P>Cognitive factors are those relating to the mental processes of memory, concentration, reasoning and judgement. Cognitive problems are common in individuals with MS and point prevalence estimates range from 43%-72% (<LINK REF="REF-Prosiegal-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prosiegal 1993</LINK>). It has been acknowledged that the types of patients studied, duration of illness and disease courses probably account for the wide range of estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>). Community based populations and those with relapse-remitting MS have lower rates (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heaton-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heaton 1985</LINK>), whilst those attending hospital, the highest. Research has shown that memory, learning, conceptual reasoning, speed of information processing and reaction time, attention, concentration and executive function are affected whereas recognition memory, implicit learning and speech comprehension remain intact (see <LINK REF="REF-Brassington-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brassington 1998</LINK>). The degree of cognitive impairment evident in individuals with MS appears to be unrelated to their neurological disability status or disease duration (<LINK REF="REF-Maurelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurelli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>). Cognitive impairment has been found to be related to poorer social and employment outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>), low mood (<LINK REF="REF-Gilchrist-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilchrist 1994</LINK>), sexual dysfunction, greater functional impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1995</LINK>) and psychopathology. These findings suggest that cognitive dysfunction is a major factor in determining the quality of life of people with MS. Severe cognitive impairment presents a major barrier to rehabilitation programmes because individuals may be unable to retain advice or have difficulty in acquiring new skills. Cognitive impairment in MS often goes undetected or is misattributed to other problems (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2002</LINK>). Rao et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>) reported that families and carers often attribute cognitive impairments to depression or other forms of psychological dysfunction.</P>
<P>PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS</P>
<P>The purpose of this research is to undertake a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions for adults with MS. Psychological interventions are broadly defined and include those that address mood and those that address cognition.</P>
<P>The literature suggests that people with MS are not adequately treated for their mood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Minden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1987</LINK>). Effective treatment of mood disorders might improve functional status, self-esteem, quality of life and compliance with medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1997b</LINK>). Psychological interventions may improve the psychological and physical well being of individuals with MS by treating mood disorders such as anxiety and depression (with possible benefits to immune function (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001b</LINK>)), by improving self management and adherence, enhancing self efficacy and esteem, reducing stress, improving coping skills and general quality of life. Psychological therapy on an individual basis may help individuals develop skills to cope with emotions, thoughts and adjustment to MS diagnosis and symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Minden-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minden 1992</LINK>). Group therapy is often used to decrease feelings of alienation, facilitate expression of emotions related to the disease, and provide peer support.</P>
<P>Undertaking cognitive assessments may help individuals restructure aspects of their lives to maximise their cognitive strengths. This could lead to a decrease in the functional impact of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Langdon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langdon 1996</LINK>), help in the planning of other rehabilitation services, and decrease dependency. Evaluations of specific interventions for cognitive problems have demonstrated beneficial effects in other patient groups such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>). However, to date, little research has been undertaken to assess the benefits of cognitive rehabilitation in individuals with MS.</P>
<P>There have been a number of intervention studies to examine the effectiveness of psychological interventions in individuals with MS (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1999c</LINK>). A variety of psychological interventions have been used including group therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bolding-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolding 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartings-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartings 1976</LINK>), individual cognitive behavioural based therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larcombe 1984</LINK>), cognitive behavioural therapy delivered via the telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2000</LINK>), insight-oriented group psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1985</LINK>), coping skills training compared with peer telephone support (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>), relaxation and imagery (<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1996</LINK>), and cognitive rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2002</LINK>). A recent study by Mohr et al. compared individual cognitive-behaviour therapy, with supportive expressive group therapy and the anti-depressant sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2001c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2001c</LINK>). Some psychological interventions have focussed on individuals with MS and depression (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Larcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larcombe 1984</LINK>), some on individuals with cognitive deficits (<LINK REF="STD-Benedict-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benedict 2000</LINK>), some have been administered on a one-to-one basis (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1987</LINK>), some in group settings (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1985</LINK>), and some over the telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Before we started this review a number of methodological challenges were evident. Firstly, in the context of all randomised controlled trials in MS, the measurement of disease and function can be problematic, particularly when the condition has a relapse-remitting course and follow-up periods are short. Secondly psychological interventions may be given at different times, for different purposes, to different subgroups of people, at different stages of their disease. The type of intervention, content, theoretical basis, intensity, duration, length of each session, whether one-to-one or in groups can vary, as can the profession and experience of the person delivering the intervention, and the location. This heterogeneity could make it difficult to combine the results from different studies. Thirdly, both in clinical practice and in randomised trials, psychological interventions often incorporate a mix of different components, for example blending cognitive rehabilitation components, say, with psychotherapy components. This overlap makes it difficult to do a series of separate Cochrane reviews that adequately covers and summarises the randomised trial evidence base. Fourthly, in trials, psychological interventions might be compared to other psychological interventions, pharmaceutical treatment, a placebo, or usual care. Each addresses different research questions and so implies a different interpretation of the results. Our solution to the latter three problems has been to conduct a review that is broad in scope, but that contains within it a series of mini-reviews that focus on the different interventions, comparison treatments and population target groups. Meta-analysis, if carried out, has been confined to within each mini-review. This provides a flexible framework that easily accommodates new evidence as it arises.</P>
<P>Particular attention has been paid to giving the review a clear, logical structure and layout. This should enable the reader of the review, despite the complexity outlined above, to find their way to the evidence that most interests them (e.g. long-term benefits of cognitive behavioural therapy in the management of depression). It also helps to highlight where there are gaps in the evidence base. For the authors, the structure will facilitate standardised updating of the review in future years, particularly if the rate of publication of relevant studies continues to increase.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and the pre- cross over component of randomised cross-over trials. Studies were not excluded on the basis of type of control group (i.e. care as usual or standard care, placebo, waiting list controls, other psychological intervention, other intervention). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (e.g. using recognised criteria such as <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 1965</LINK>). Studies were included in the review regardless of clinical course or the length of time since diagnosis of MS. Studies based on subgroups of people with MS such as those with depression, those with cognitive impairment, those with severe physical disability, were included, and were considered in separate mini-reviews. If we had found studies that included people with MS together with people with other medical conditions, and the number of people in the study with MS had made it worthwhile to do so (i.e. exceeded 20), the authors would have been contacted to try and get the results for the MS subgroup. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Interventions described as wholly or mostly based on psychological theory and practice. Interventions could have been delivered by psychologists, counsellors, medical staff, nurses, occupational therapists or other health professionals, and were included regardless of the number of therapy sessions or whether sessions were one-to-one or group. The following gives an idea of the types of interventions that either were included or could have been included: </P>
<P>Psychoanalytic therapy - looking back at past events in order to gain insight<BR/>Behavioural therapy - a variety of techniques that attempt to modify behaviour, including stress management and relaxation.<BR/>Cognitive therapy - a variety of techniques that attempt to change attitudes, perceptions and ways of thinking.<BR/>Educational - teaching of psychological theory in relation to the disease<BR/>Counselling - Non-directive approach involving talking through problems<BR/>Cognitive rehabilitation - a variety of techniques that attempt to reduce the impact of cognitive impairments<BR/>Other - e.g. family therapy etc.</P>
<P>Sometimes the interventions evaluated consisted of a combination of these techniques. Interventions that were substantively different have been considered under separate sub-headings within each mini-review.</P>

<P>The reference lists of identified papers were searched for further relevant trials. In June 2004 we wrote to those who had already undertaken trials in this area to identify other published or unpublished trials. We searched registers of trials in progress (National Research Register, www.controlled-trials.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) and contacted the primary investigator.</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-15 12:02:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>The review was carried out by four authors (one with methodological expertise, one with psychological expertise, one with clinical expertise in multiple sclerosis, and one with expertise in nursing research). To help get a broader view of the context, design, conduct and interpretation of the review, the authors were aided by an advisory group. The advisory group included the authors and a clinical psychologist/ researcher, a clinical neurophysiologist/ researcher, a senior librarian, and 2 consumers.</P>
<P>Abstracts of identified studies were sifted by one author to identify those that seemed pertinent: at this stage we excluded studies that were obviously not controlled trials or randomised controlled trials, those that had not included people with MS, or assessed interventions of a psychological nature. The full papers of these (including those where there was any uncertainty) were then compared to the above criteria by the four authors. Where there was disagreement between the authors or uncertainty, this was resolved by discussion followed by either consensus or a majority vote. If disagreement or uncertainty remained then the authors consulted other members of the advisory group. Authors would have been contacted if clarification or further information had been needed in order to reach a decision.</P>
<P>Each study was allocated to a mini-review based on the target population. Different types of intervention were then addressed in sub-sections within each mini-review. This structure was chosen instead of one basing each mini-review on a type of intervention, because of difficulties in classifying some interventions, the eclectic nature of some interventions, and the overall diversity of interventions. Currently the mini-reviews are:</P>
<P>Mini-review 1: People with MS with cognitive impairment<BR/>Mini-review 2: People with MS with moderate to severe disability<BR/>Mini-review 3: People with MS<BR/>Mini-review 4: People with MS with depression</P>
<P>The structure of the review permits other mini-reviews to be added as new research evidence becomes available. Other possibilities for target populations include, people with MS with fatigue, people with MS with pain, people with MS with anxiety, and so on.</P>
<P>
<B>Study quality</B>
</P>
<P>The main measure of trial quality was whether random allocation had been adequately concealed. Estimates of treatment effect have been shown to be inflated when studies with poor allocation concealment are included in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Allocation concealment was rated as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>); A (adequate: e.g. central or independent randomisation, opaque sealed envelopes), B (unclear: method not described or described but not clear), C (inadequate: open random number lists, alternation, date of birth or any other procedure that is transparent before allocation), or D (not done).</P>
<P>Other components of study quality were also assessed and recorded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The method of randomisation generation; A (adequate, such as random number table, computer generated random numbers), B (partial, such as sealed envelopes but no further details given), C (inadequate, such as birth date, alternation) or D (unknown, with just the term randomised used).</LI>
<LI>The number of participants withdrawing or dropping out of each arm of the study, together with a quality score; A (adequate with number randomised and withdrawn from each group stated along with reasons), B (partial, numbers given but not reasons, or vice versa), C (inadequate, with numbers randomised not stated or not specified in each group), or D (no details given)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The nature of the interventions being considered made it unlikely that the researcher or clinician who had given the intervention could be masked. Masking of the researcher who made the assessments or, of the person with MS, was possible although difficult. Many of the primary outcome measures had been completed by the person with MS recording their own perspectives and so assessor masking could not have been achieved unless the person with MS had been masked. It may have been possible to mask the people undertaking the data analysis and interpretation of results.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Data for the review were extracted independently by the four authors with disagreement and uncertainty dealt with as before. The following information was extracted using a pre-agreed data extraction tool:</P>
<P>Date, country and clinical setting of trial.<BR/>Description of target population<BR/>Recruitment procedures, inclusion and exclusion criteria<BR/>Flow chart showing flow of participants through all stages of the study<BR/>Participant characteristics (age, gender, years since diagnosis, type of MS, degree of disability, and psychiatric diagnoses).<BR/>Description of intervention, duration, frequency, how delivered, who delivered, format of delivery, training of person delivering, whether adapted for MS, and whether concomitant interventions were given.<BR/>Type of control group (s) and, if appropriate, description of the duration, frequency, how delivered, who delivered, format of delivery, training of person delivering, whether adapted for MS, and whether concomitant interventions were given.</P>
<P>Comparability of baseline characteristics between treatment and control groups.<BR/>Description of follow-up<BR/>Outcomes measured, whether primary or secondary, and when they were recorded<BR/>Number enrolled in trial and in each group<BR/>Presence of sample size calculation<BR/>Number included at each follow-up in each group<BR/>Attempts at masking<BR/>Description of randomisation and randomisation concealment<BR/>Number and reasons for drop-out and withdrawal in each group<BR/>Whether intention-to-treat analysis undertaken<BR/>For nominal outcomes (denominator and numerator in each category for each group)<BR/>For interval and ordinal data (N, mean, SD for each group) or (N, median, IQR or range) as appropriate.</P>
<P>If both intention-to-treat and "per protocol" analyses had been conducted only the former data were extracted.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
</P>
<P>
<BR/>Meta-analysis was only conducted within mini-reviews and only when it seemed logical to do so; that is, when groups, interventions, control groups, outcomes and length of follow-up were sufficiently similar. When meta-analysis was appropriate, a test of heterogeneity was used to assess whether the results from the different studies were (statistically) sufficiently similar to combine them.</P>
<P>For outcomes measured on a dichotomous scale, results are presented as odds ratios and as risk differences, homogeneity was assessed using a chi-squared test, and odds ratios/ risk differences combined using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure.</P>
<P>For outcomes measured on an interval or ordinal scale, results are presented as means and standard deviations, a chi-squared test was used to assess homogeneity and results from different studies combined using weighted mean differences. Standardised effect sizes using Hedges' adjusted have been used to summarise mean differences between groups. This enables comparison of effect sizes between different outcome measures. Unless otherwise indicated, positive standardised effect sizes indicate that the intervention is producing more benefit to participants than the comparison group.</P>
<P>If two or more studies measured outcome in the same dimension but using a different tool then we considered standardising the scores (using the pooled within group standard deviation) and then combining the studies as above.</P>
<P>By default, a fixed-effects model was used for combining studies. If tests for heterogeneity were statistically significant and inspection of the individual results suggested that it still seemed logical to combine results, then a random effects model was used. Statistical precision was summarised using 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Within a mini-review no subgroup analyses were done.</P>
<P>Had the results from three or more studies within a mini-review been combined, then a sensitivity analysis would have been considered. This would have taken two forms (a) Sequential elimination of trials from the analysis according to their level of allocation concealment (i.e. type D studies eliminated first, then type C studies, then type B) to see how the results were affected; (b) data reanalysed using worst case, best case, and random case scenarios for participants without outcome data to assess the robustness of the results.</P>
<P>The review was conducted using RevMan 4.2 software</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:49:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search strategy identified 26 relevant trials, of which six were excluded after reading the full papers (see table of "Characteristics of excluded studies"), two, identified between January and May 2005, are awaiting assessment (see reference list of studies waiting assessment) and two are ongoing (see table of "Characteristics of ongoing studies"). The remaining 16 trials, reported in 17 papers (one trial was reported over two papers (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2003</LINK>)), are all randomised controlled trials, are included in the review, and are described in detail in the table of "Characteristics of included studies". A further paper (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2004</LINK>), listed in the table of "Characteristics of excluded studies", contained additional data for a study that was included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2001</LINK>), but none of the outcomes reported satisfied the review's inclusion criteria. One of the six excluded studies appeared not to come within our definition of a psychological intervention, one was excluded because it did not include appropriate outcome measures, and four were excluded because they did not appear to be randomised. The 16 included studies have been grouped together in four Mini-reviews. Only two of the studies in one of the mini-reviews were sufficiently similar in terms of type of participant, type of intervention, type of comparison group, and outcome measure for a meta-analysis to be conducted. The number of participants per study ranged from 15 to 240, median 37, with a total of 1006 over all 16 studies. Twelve studies had a two group design, and four studies a three group design (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2001</LINK> (although one group was excluded because it wasn't randomised), <LINK REF="STD-Rigby-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rigby 2003</LINK>). Length of follow-up from start of treatment ranged from five weeks to four years. </P>
<P>One study used a measure of MS specific quality of life, two measured general quality of life, 12 measured psychiatric symptoms, 10 measured psychological function, two measured disability, five measured cognitive outcomes, three studies measured fatigue, one study measured pain, one measured an aspect of health care utilisation (none undertook an economic assessment), one measured changes in medication usage, and one measured adherence to medication. None measured MS relapses. Fifteen studies measured outcome immediately post-treatment, nine measured short-term outcome, three measured medium term outcome and one measured long-term outcome. </P>

All factors have been converted into age, sex and education status adjusted t-scores based on data from a sample of healthy people without MS where mean t-score = 50 and SD = 10. One of these 11 factors is a composite of four factors (memory span, verbal learning, visuo-spatial memory and visuo-motor speed). This composite factor showed no difference in improvement between pre-treatment and immediately post-treatment in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean improvement 1.8 v 1.1 respectively, p=0.53, no other details given). There were no significant differences in the four factors that made up this composite factor. There was a larger improvement in visual perception in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean improvement 2.0 v 0.6 respectively, p=0.04, no other details given), but not in verbal intelligence (mean improvement 1.0 v 0.7 respectively, p=0.91, no other details given), or WAIS performance (mean improvement 5.2 v 7.3 respectively, p=0.42).

<P>Immediately post-treatment:-Satisfaction with quality of life was measured by global satisfaction, satisfaction with health, satisfaction with family life, spiritual satisfaction, and satisfaction with socio-economic status in the study of Schwartz (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>). Psychosocial limitations of role performance and physical limitations of role performance were measured by the Sickness Impact Profile. The method of statistical analysis was complex, involved consideration of all pretreatment, during treatment and post-treatment data simultaneously, and two types of statistical analysis used in parallel (one of which adjusted for sex and change in EDSS over the course of treatment). It was therefore not possible to identify from the report whether there was any specific effect immediately post-treatment. There was some evidence that over the course of the whole study there were greater improvements in global satisfaction with quality of life, and satisfaction with family life in the imagery group, but in each case this was statistically significant for only one of the two methods of analysis. Means and SDs were not reported.</P>

In the paper, complex multilevel modelling was used to analyse all follow-up points simultaneously (including mid-intervention measurements) and to adjust for baseline quality of life and impairment. The authors concluded that across time points the intervention group had a higher score on the bodily pain scale (i.e. less pain on average) and a higher score on the mental health scale (better mental health).</P>
<P>Short term follow-up:-<LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK> measured nine dimensions of general quality of life. The mean (SD) in the intervention group, the waiting list control group and the standardised mean difference between them was 51.0 (29.1), 40.2 (30.8), standardised mean difference= 0.36 (-0.03, 0.75) for physical functioning: 46.9 (43.8), 41.4 (42.0), standardised mean difference= 0.13 (-0.26, 0.51) for physical role: 66.7 (24.6), 63.8 (28.2), standardised mean difference= 0.11 (-0.28, 0.49) for bodily pain: 57.1 (24.9), 60.4 (23.9), standardised mean difference= -0.13 (-0.52, 0.25) for general health: 44.0 (22.3), 41.2 (21.5), standardised mean difference= 0.13 (-0.26, 0.51) for vitality: 69.6 (25.9), 70.2 (24.4), standardised mean difference= -0.02 (-0.41, 0.36) for social functioning: 76.2 (36.0), 65.5 (42.5), standardised mean difference= 0.27 (-0.12, 0.66) for emotional role: and 74.6 (15.0), 71.7 (19.7), standardised mean difference= 0.16 (-0.22, 0.55) for mental health. Thus, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. However, in the paper, complex multilevel modelling was used to analyse all follow-up points simultaneously (including mid-intervention measurements) and to adjust for baseline quality of life and impairment. The authors concluded that across time points the intervention group had a higher score on the bodily pain scale (i.e. less pain on average) and a higher score on the mental health scale (better mental health).</P>

<P>Immediately post-treatment:- In the Larcombe et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Larcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larcombe 1984</LINK>) mean (SD) post-treatment self-reported depression was 8.1 (5.0) in the CBT group and 33.4 (9.7) in the control group (standardised mean difference = 3.07 (95% CI; 1.65, 4.49), p-value adjusted for pre-treatment depression &lt;0.01). Mean clinician rated depression was 2.0 (1.5) and 17.4 (8.3) respectively (standardised mean difference = 2.40 (95% CI; 1.16, 3.65), p-value adjusted for pre-treatment depression &lt;0.01).</P>
<P>In the Mohr et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2000</LINK>) mean mood on a depression-dejection subscale was significantly lower in the CBT group (18.7 (13.8)) than in the control group (26.7 (13.7)) (standardised mean difference = 0.57 (95% CI; -0.14, 1.28), p=0.01 after p-value adjusted for baseline mood).</P>
<P>Using meta-analysis to combine the results from these two studies, the overall standardised mean difference is 1.07 (0.43, 1.70) using a fixed effects model. The heterogeneity test comparing the mean differences between the two studies is statistically significant (p=0.002), possibly due to differences in the way depression is measured. Using a random effects model changed the standardised mean difference to 1.74 (-0.71, 4.19), p=0.16. These mean differences are not adjusted for baseline measures of depression; in the individual studies the differences are statistically significant once baseline measures are taken into account.</P>

<P>
<B>General</B>
</P>
<P>Although the search strategy detected 16 randomised trials, there was little overlap between them in terms of population, intervention, outcome and timing of outcome. Only two studies were similar enough to be included in a meta-analysis, and then only for one outcome measure. Many of our conclusions are necessarily based on the results of individual trials. It is evident that the scope for using psychological interventions to help people with MS is broad, but that the randomised controlled trial evidence base for their effectiveness is relatively small. Further trials need to be conducted. The flexibility of the mini-review format used in this review makes it relatively easy to incorporate the diversity of existing and future trials. It is envisaged that further mini-reviews will be added as the evidence base grows.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodology</B>
</P>
<P>Psychological interventions are complex in that they usually consist of a number of different elements. Some of these elements will be active ingredients specifically included because they are based on psychological theory. Other elements may not be specific to psychological interventions and may be common to many different types of intervention (such as interacting with other people with MS in a group). Still other elements will be specific to individual therapists (for example the therapist's experience and enthusiasm, and the way the therapist interacts with the client). To help generalisability of findings, interventions should be described in detail and, ideally, manualised so that the same intervention can be transferred outside the study environment. The distinction should always be made between trials that have a pragmatic basis (where the focus is on whether the whole therapy works and measures the effect that would be seen if the intervention was introduced into clinical practice) and those that have a therapeutic focus (where the aim is to discover which elements of the intervention work).</P>
<P>Many of the individual trials had a small sample size, and this raises the possibility that their conclusions are flawed because of the high chance of making a type II error (incorrectly concluding that the intervention has no effect). When the study is small because it is a pilot study, this should be clearly stated in the title or abstract. When the study is not a pilot study it is highly desirable that the protocol includes a comprehensive justification of sample size, including formal sample size calculations, and this should be reported in detail in resultant publications. The results of underpowered studies that replicate the protocol of existing, completed, studies can be usefully combined using meta-analysis. In all studies, presenting differences between treatment arms using confidence intervals will allow the reader to gauge the influence of sample size on the precision of the results.</P>
<P>Because of the complex nature of psychological interventions, researchers often use a large number of diverse outcome measures, measured on more than one occasion, to assess their effect. However, with multiple significance testing comes the increased risk of making a type I error (incorrectly concluding that the intervention has an effect). The best way of minimising the impact of this multiplicity is to specify <I>a priori</I>, in the protocol, one or two <U>primary</U> outcome measures; these would then be given particular prominence in the resultant publications. Another approach that can be used in parallel, or as an alternative, is to adjust for multiple significance testing in the statistical analysis. A common way of doing this is to use a Bonferroni adjusted critical significance level that reduces the chance of making a type I error. It should be noted that using a procedure like this will have a knock-on effect of increasing the chance of making a type II error, and so sample size will need to be increased to take this into account.</P>
<P>For many of the studies identified in this review it was difficult to make clear judgements about quality because the method of randomisation, method of allocation concealment and description of withdrawals were not reported in sufficient detail. To some extent the problem is historical; three studies were published in the 1980s and four in the 1990s. Encouraging researchers and Journal Editors to consider the guidance in the CONSORT statement should help improve the reporting of new trials.</P>
<P>The methods of statistical analysis used in trials of psychological interventions are often quite sophisticated; for example measurements made on multiple occasions (repeated measures) are often analysed simultaneously, and baseline measurements are often included in the analysis. However the reporting of basic statistics is often inadequate and this sometimes makes it impossible to complete the data extraction tool, and would prevent the use of meta-analysis techniques if they were otherwise appropriate. We suggest that appropriate summary statistics (e.g. mean, SD and n for interval or ordinal scales outcomes, % and n for dichotomous outcomes) should be presented for all outcome measures (regardless of whether they were statistically significant) at each time point on which they were measured. This would enable studies to contribute fully to the systematic review.</P>
<P>
<B>Mini-review 1:-People with MS with cognitive impairment. </B>
</P>
<P>Only three trials have been conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Benedict-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benedict 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonsson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solari-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solari 2004</LINK>). One very small study (<LINK REF="STD-Benedict-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benedict 2000</LINK>) (n=15) compared one measure of psychiatric symptoms (depression) immediately post treatment in a group having neuropsychotherapy with a group receiving supportive psychotherapy. No statistically significant differences were found, although the chance of making a type II error is high because of the small sample size. A second study (<LINK REF="STD-Jonsson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jonsson 1993</LINK>) (n=48) compared psychiatric symptoms and cognitive outcomes in a group receiving combined cognitive rehabilitation and neuropsychotherapy with an "attention" control group. Of three measures of psychiatric symptoms, one, depression, was of borderline statistical significance both immediately post-treatment and at short term follow-up. Neither would have been significant if compared to a Bonferroni adjusted critical p-value. Of 11 cognitive outcomes, one was of borderline statistical significance immediately post-treatment, and another was of borderline statistical significance at short-term follow-up. Again, neither would have been significant if compared to a Bonferroni adjusted critical p-value. A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Solari-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solari 2004</LINK>) (n=82) compared two measures of MS specific quality of life, one measure of psychiatric symptoms, and eight measures of cognitive function in a group receiving computer aided retraining of memory with a sham therapy. Of the two measures of MS specific quality of life, one (mental health subscale) was of borderline statistical significance immediately post-treatment, but not at short-term follow-up. The one measure of psychiatric symptoms (depression) was similar between the two groups. Of the eight measures of cognitive function, one (Word List Generation test) was significantly different immediately post-treatment and at short-term follow-up, but none of the other seven measures showed a difference on either occasion. Neither would have been significant if compared to a Bonferroni adjusted critical p-value. One summary measure of cognitive function was prespecified by the authors as being the primary outcome measure: this did not improve significantly as a result of treatment. No data were available on other types of outcome measures and on medium or long-term effects of treatment. Given the different aims of the three studies, no meta analysis was possible.</P>
<P>Cognitive assessment and treatment are important areas for psychologists working with people with MS. Randomised trials of their effectiveness are limited in number and in the variety of interventions. The available data are not particularly conclusive either way, and one explanation could be the relatively small sample sizes. Further trials in this area would be useful.</P>
<P>
<B>Mini-review 2: People with MS with moderate to severe disability</B>
</P>
<P>Three trials were included in this mini-review (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2001</LINK>). None of the interventions was sufficiently similar to the others for a meta-analysis to be conducted. A small trial of psychotherapy versus placebo versus care as usual (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 1985</LINK>) (n=32 over three groups) compared two measures of psychiatric symptoms and two measures of psychological functioning immediately post-treatment. People in the psychotherapy group were less depressed than those in the other two groups. The other two trials were also small; one of social skills training looking at psychological functioning (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>), and the other on combined cognitive assessment and rehabilitation looking at psychiatric symptoms and cognitive outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2001</LINK>). For the former study, participants tended to score reasonably well on the relevant measures even at baseline, and there were no significant differences between the groups post-treatment. For the latter study the data were not presented in a way that allowed comparison of the two groups.</P>
<P>Again the limited data available suggest that further trials in this area would be useful.</P>
<P>
<B>Mini-review 3:- People with MS</B>
</P>
<P>There were seven trials in this mini-review (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigby-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rigby 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wassem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wassem 2003</LINK>). Three of the studies evaluated interventions using cognitive behavioural approaches. One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1987</LINK>) (n=41) of individual cognitive behavioural therapy versus psychotherapy using four measures of psychiatric symptoms and two measures of psychological functioning measured immediately post-treatment found lower depression, general anxiety, perceived distress and improved coping in people given CBT. Another larger trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rigby-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rigby 2003</LINK>) (n=147) comparing a brief group-based cognitive behavioural therapy to a placebo social discussion group, and to a group receiving an information booklet, used two measures of psychiatric symptoms and six measures of psychological function measured immediately post treatment, short-term (on three occasions) and medium term. The data were analysed using two different methods, one of which used a baseline adjusted summary measure of the entire follow-up period. This latter analysis suggested that the group given CBT had lower anxiety, higher self-efficacy (one of two such measures) and better dispositional resilience (three of four such measures) than the information booklet group, but not the placebo control group. One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Wassem-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wassem 2003</LINK>) (n=27) with four years of follow-up, compared a group-based cognitive behavioural approach to improving adjustment to MS, with standard care, using three measures of adjustment and measures of pain and fatigue. There were no statistically significant differences. The results of two of the cognitive behavioural therapy trials look encouraging, although with the group-based study we are unable to exclude the possibility that it is the group environment that is having the effect rather than the therapy <I>per se</I>. The three studies have different emphases (stress inoculation; understanding emotions, and coping; and self-efficacy) but also appear to have much in common.</P>
<P>A small study of guided imagery and relaxation (<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1996</LINK>) found a difference in one outcome (lower state anxiety) out of eight (two measuring psychiatric symptoms and six measuring psychological functioning). A medium size study comparing coping skills training with peer support (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>) looked at a variety of quality of life (seven), psychiatric symptom (two), psychological functioning (16), disability (one), cognitive (one) and fatigue (one) outcomes. The method of analysis was complex and analysed outcomes immediately post-treatment, short-term and long-term follow-up simultaneously and in two different ways. Of the 55 different analyses, five were statistically significant (two quality of life, two psychological functioning and the measure of disability). Another medium-sized trial (240 people over three groups) compared a group receiving cognitive assessment and cognitive rehabilitation with a group receiving cognitive assessment only and a care as usual group. There were no differences in quality of life (four measures), psychological functioning (one measure) or cognitive outcomes (three measures) between any of the groups except for a poorer average quality of life in the assessment only group. One medium-sized study (<LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK>) (n=142) compared a health behaviour change therapy with a waiting list control group using nine measures of general quality of life, and one measure of disability. Two of the measures of quality of life were statistically significant. The trial of cognitive rehabilitation and assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2002</LINK>) was of reasonable size but did not show benefit; indeed, there was some suggestion that cognitive assessment only without rehabilitation treatment might even be harmful. The other trials were often difficult to interpret because of the small number of differences found relative to the number of outcome measures looked at, and none pre-specified a small number of outcomes as primary outcome measures.</P>
<P>
<B>Mini-review 4:</B>
</P>
<P>There were three trials in this mini-review (<LINK REF="STD-Larcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larcombe 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2003</LINK>). Two trials looked at cognitive behavioural therapy versus control conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Larcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larcombe 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2000</LINK>). Both studies looked at a small number of outcome measures and even though sample sizes were small, both showed significant improvements in depression, and mood in the CBT group. A fixed effects meta-analysis of these two studies also showed significant improvement as a result of CBT (although there was significant heterogeneity between the two studies, and a reanalysis using a random effects models was not statistically significant). A comparison of CBT with anti-depressants (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 2003</LINK>) showed no statistically significant differences, although sample size was small (n=41), and the possibility of a type I error cannot be excluded. This last study also included a non-randomised group of patients who received supporting-expressive group therapy. Post-treatment levels of depression in this group were significantly worse than in both the CBT and anti-depressant groups. Results from this mini-review are encouraging despite the small sample size. CBT is an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression in the general population, and this adds weight to the evidence in this mini review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:36:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>MS is a complex disease, and, potentially, there are many different ways in which psychological interventions can help. This is reflected in the diversity of approaches that have been identified in this review. Interventions can differ by their target population, purpose, whether group-based or one-to-one, the psychological theories and models from which they are derived, and so on. The review shows that considerable creativity and innovation has gone into developing and adapting these interventions. The downside of this is that, in general, interventions have been evaluated in single studies only, and often with limited sample size.</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy was the most frequently used psychological approach. In all but one of these seven studies the purpose of the intervention was either to treat depression or (broadly) to give people skills to help them cope with having MS (albeit in different ways). In general these results were promising. Also they should not be interpreted in isolation from research that has been conducted in people without MS, or from non-randomised evidence. For example evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural approaches in treating mild to moderate depression in the general population may be relevant to people with MS with depression. A related question is whether people with MS should be regularly assessed for depression and other psychiatric problems. Clearly effective treatments need to be available before regular assessment becomes worthwhile.</P>
<P>There were no studies focusing on psychological approaches to managing common symptoms of MS such as fatigue and pain. However, there are Cochrane systematic reviews suggesting that cognitive behavioural approaches may be useful in adults with chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2004</LINK>) and people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Price-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1998</LINK>). Clearly interventions like these would need to be adapted for, and evaluated in, people with MS.</P>
<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to help people with cognitive impairments was inconclusive, partly because of the large number of outcome measures that are frequently used in this type of study, and partly because of small sample size. Further, the small number of studies actually conducted (all three of which tested different interventions) means that it is difficult to generalise about whether psychological approaches to treating cognitive impairment are helpful.</P>
<P>Two of the studies qualifying for this review used interventions that were delivered by nurses. Psychologists working in the acute hospital setting in the NHS are in short supply. Training and supporting other health professionals to deliver psychology-based interventions, or to deliver interventions that incorporate psychological principles, could be useful. This would need to be corroborated by research evidence.</P>
<P>Where a psychological intervention is found to be effective, consideration should be given as to how that intervention can be replicated elsewhere whilst maintaining effectiveness. Describing interventions in some detail (e.g. in a manual) would facilitate the standardisation of procedures and widespread adoption of the intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:49:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Although this review has identified 16 relevant studies, they are very diverse, and there are large gaps in the evidence base for the use of psychological interventions for people with MS. There are many different areas that could be researched, but this section focuses on those areas that would probably be fruitful in the short to medium term. The studies on cognitive behavioural approaches for depression are encouraging, but sample sizes are small, and a larger sufficiently powered study is needed. Research is also needed to evaluate whether screening for depression and other psychiatric problems, combined with psychological or pharmacological therapy, is effective.</P>
<P>We found no completed studies evaluating psychological treatments for MS symptoms such as fatigue and pain. We found one ongoing study evaluating one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy in the management of fatigue. Symptom management is an area where research in other chronic diseases is encouraging, and where further work in MS would be useful.</P>
<P>The existing research on adjustment and coping looks encouraging. MS is characterised by either relapse-remitting phases or progressive accumulation of disability, and adjustment and coping can be seen as an ongoing process throughout the course of the disease. More focussed approaches to adjustment and coping, such as looking at the period soon after diagnosis, or looking at different types of MS, would be useful.</P>
<P>There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in relation to the delivery of psychological treatment. For example, what are the relative merits of providing treatment in groups or on a one-to-one basis? What is the potential for professions other than psychologists, such as nurses and occupational therapists, to conduct psychology-based interventions? When is it most timely to deliver interventions such as those about adjusting to, and coping with having MS? Is it possible to identify subgroups of people with MS who would benefit most from psychological approaches?</P>
<P>Some of this research will need to take the form of a randomised control trial, although this may not always be the most suitable methodology.</P>
<P>As well as having implications for the types of research that need to be conducted, there are also implications for the reporting of randomised controlled trials, and for methodology. There were noticeable improvements over time in the quality of the papers reviewed. Reporting of trials should follow CONSORT guidelines where possible. Clearer reporting of indicators of quality such as the method of randomisation is needed. Masking of participants or researchers is usually not possible given the nature of these interventions. However, it may sometimes be possible to mask the person assessing outcome, the data analyst, or the person interpreting the results, and this would help to minimise bias. Some of the studies in the review have compared a psychological intervention to two control groups; one a care as usual group, and the other a placebo group. This design is helpful in addressing the dual questions of whether the intervention is beneficial, and if so, why? More detailed reporting of basic summary statistics such as means and standard deviations is necessary so that results can be incorporated into meta analyses. Interventions need to have a clear purpose, and described in sufficient detail so that the reader can understand the underlying principles and have a clear picture of the structure and content.</P>
<P>Many of the studies in this review are limited by small sample size. They were rarely described as pilot studies, and none was followed up with a larger trial. Pilot studies are an important phase of developing and evaluating a psychological intervention, and should be described as such. Sample size for other studies should be based on a formal sample size calculation. Many studies used large numbers of outcome measures, but rarely identified a small number, <I>a priori</I>, as primary outcome measures. This would greatly facilitate the interpretation of individual trials. Studies should, where appropriate, include measures that are of direct relevance to the person with MS, such as measures of quality of life. MS specific measures are likely to be better at picking up changes in quality of life than generic measures. Researchers should try to measure outcomes (particularly primary outcomes) even when participants drop out of the intervention. This will enable a proper intention-to-treat analysis to be conducted.</P>

<P>Since the original publication of the protocol, the following change has taken place. One measure of study quality has been dropped. Originally studies were going to be classified according to whether they used intention to treat principles; A (no withdrawals), B (withdrawals excluded), C (withdrawals included in the analysis by estimating outcome), D (withdrawals followed-up and included in the analysis). In practice this system proved difficult to apply because some studies could not be classified uniquely (for example, in a single study some withdrawals might have been included, and some excluded). Also, there were different types of withdrawals (e.g. withdrawal from providing data, withdrawal from treatment, permanent withdrawal, temporary withdrawal), again making classification difficult.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention 1: (8 randomised, 8 analysed). Neurological compensatory training. Intervention involved individual and caregiver only. 12 consecutive weekly sessions, 1 hr per week. Conducted by clinical neuropsychologist, site not stated. Three components (i) use of neuropsychological, neuroradiological evidence and caregiver anecdotes to enhance patient and caregiver understanding of neurological basis of cognitive impairment, pathological affect and abnormal social behaviour. (ii) social skills training to improve individuals' capacity to appreciate the perspective of others (iii) cognitive behavioural strategies to enhance self-control and behaviour regulation in order to diminish frequency of socially aggressive behaviour. <BR/>Intervention 2: (7 randomised, 7 analysed). Non-specific supportive psychotherapy. Intervention involved individual and caregiver only. 12 consecutive weekly sessions of 1 hr. Intervention provided by counsellor trained in general psychotherapy, site not stated. Aim was emotional support and stress modulation by fostering personality growth and behaviour change.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Measured at pre-treatment and immediately post-treatment (within 2 weeks of end of treatment). Primary outcomes: Measure of psychiatric symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (self reported). Secondary outcomes: None. Outcomes not included: Caregiver reports of Social Aggression Score (modified from a brain injury scale), Hogan Empathy Scale (adapted), and revised NEO Personality Inventory (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness subscales).</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Mini-review 1.<BR/>The specific criteria by which participants were selected as having cognitive impairment or behaviour disorder are not defined. However, compared to a healthy control group of volunteers (n=15), the participants with MS scored (statistically) significantly higher on most of a baseline battery of 10 tests of cognition and 7 tests of personality/ behaviour. Further all those with MS scored over 4 on the Social Aggression Score and all healthy controls scored less than 4.</P>

Groups of 4/5, 1.5 hrs per week for 6 weeks by a Clinical Psychologist at a specialist MS centre. In sessions 1-2 the emphasis was on behavioural procedures and based on a behavioural theory of depression. The sessions aimed to increase the frequency, quality and range of activities and social interactions. This included deriving activity schedules, instigating and monitoring engagement in activities, and discussing social interactions. In sessions 3-6 there was increasing emphasis on cognitive procedures aiming to identify depressogenic and distorted cognitions and irrational beliefs, subject them to analysis and empirical testing, and encourage realistic and positive thinking. Participants were trained to monitor positive and negative thoughts; recognise the connection between affect, cognition and behaviour; examine the evidence against negative thoughts and irrational beliefs; substitute more positive interpretations for the negative cognitions; to identify and alter irrational beliefs which predispose to distortion of experiences.<BR/>Control group: Start of CBT delayed for 6 weeks (waiting list control)</P>

<P>People with MS with mild to moderate cognitive impairment recruited via neurologists in 6 centres.<BR/>Inclusion: (a) Poser definition, (b) complained of poor attention or memory, (c) score &lt;80th percentile in 2 or more components of Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests.<BR/>Exclusion: (a) &lt;18 or &gt;65 yrs old, (b) Mini-Mental State Examination &lt;24, (c) education of &lt;8yrs duration,<BR/>(d) ongoing major psychiatric disorder, (e) exacerbation in past 3 months, (f) immunomodulant/ immunosuppressant treatment initiation in last 4 months, (g) cognitive rehabilitation in last 6 months.<BR/>203 assessed for eligibility, 82 randomised, 77 started treatment, 75 followed-up at 8 and 16 weeks and analysed.<BR/>3 with primary progressive MS, 35 with secondary progressive, and 39 with relapse-remitting. Mean age 44yrs (range 22-65 yrs), 49F, 28M, people with major psychiatric diagnosis excluded, mean age at diagnosis 29 yrs (range 19-53), median EDSS 3.5 (range 1.5-7.0).</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention (42 randomised, 40 received treatment, 38 analysed): Computer aided retraining of memory and attention. 16 sessions of 45 minutes duration over 8 weeks. Individual, outpatient-based therapy conducted with a trained psychologist. Used the "memory" and "attention" modules of the RehaCom software package. A special keyboard was employed in order to limit the impact of motor co-ordination on the results.<BR/>Control (40 randomised, 37 treated, 37 analysed): Sham computer aided retraining of memory and attention. Exactly the same as above except using (simplified versions of) the "visuo-constructional" and "visuo-motor co-ordination" retraining modules. These modules are similar in appearance to the ones used in the intervention, but train mainly motor skills rather than memory and attention.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Measured at baseline, immediately post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline), and short-term follow-up (16 weeks after baseline). Primary outcomes: Disease specific quality of life was measured using the MSQOL-54 (mental health subscale and cognitive subscale). Psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Chicago Mood Depression Inventory (mood subscale). Cognitive function was measured using the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests (Buschke Selective Reminding Test - consistent long-term retrieval and delayed recall scores (measure of verbal learning and recall), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (measure of sustained attention and information processing speed), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (measure of complex attention and concentration), Word List Generation (measure of verbal fluency and sustained attention), 10/36 Spatial Recall Test- immediate recall and delayed recall (measures visuospatial learning and recall), and an increase of 20% or more from baseline in at least 2 of these tests).</P>

<P>Intervention (number randomised and number analysed not stated): MS-REHAB program: 2 hrs once per week for 4 weeks. Group-based therapy run by a nurse and held at a College of Nursing. Therapy developed from the literature and experience, and based on Bandura's Social Cognitive theory with an emphasis on self-efficacy. The programme aimed to increase self-efficacy for adjustment behaviours, and increase outcome expectations. This, it is theorised, will lead to increased use of adjustment behaviours, and hence increased adjustment to MS, increased symptom management, well-being and activities. Behaviour acquisition using verbal persuasion, role modelling, performance accomplishment and vicarious experience. Week1:-disease process, influencing factors, stretching and exercise, pharmacological and non-pharmacological managment of symptoms, communicating with health professional, stress and relaxation. Week 2:- relaxation, diet, strategies for managing fatigue, exercise, stretching. Week 3:-psychosocial factors, reaction of others, employment, sources of help, sleep, exercise, stretching, cognitive dysfunction. Week 4: Cognitive dysfunction, memory, impact on life, medication. Homework tasks used throughout.<BR/>Control group (number randomised and number analysed not known): Not given MS-REHAB program.</P>
