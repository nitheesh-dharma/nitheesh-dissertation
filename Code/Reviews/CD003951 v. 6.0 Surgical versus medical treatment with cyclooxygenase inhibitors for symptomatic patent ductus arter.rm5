<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-20 10:56:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The way an infant's blood is circulated changes soon after birth. Initially, premature infants have an opening (a patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) between the large blood vessel to the lungs and the large blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Early symptomatic treatment of PDA, when clinical signs first appear, helps reduce the amount of time an infant needs assisted breathing (mechanical ventilation) and the likelihood of chronic lung disease and damaging inflammation of the gut (necrotising enterocolitis). Standard therapy includes restricting fluids, diuretics and cyclooxygenase inhibitors like indomethacin or ibuprofen. The PDA is closed surgically if these medical treatments do not work. Only one randomised controlled study could be included in this review (including 154 preterm infants that needed breathing support). Indomethacin and surgery gave similar benefits. There were no differences in deaths during the hospital stay, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, cerebral or other bleeding. Surgery was more effective in closing the PDA (three needed to treat for one to benefit) but it was associated with complications (pneumothorax and retinopathy of prematurity). The one study found was carried out over 30 years ago. Clinical practice has changed a great deal and surgical closure of a PDA is safer. Therefore, whether the results of the study are applicable today is debatable. Updates of this review in July 2007 and February 2012 did not identify any additional randomised controlled studies for inclusion, but three observational studies indicated an increased risk for one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation: chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity and neurosensory impairment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:38:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are numerous reports suggesting that prophylactic closure of the ductus arteriosus reduces the incidence of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and need for surgical ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>). Also, early symptomatic treatment of PDA (i.e. when clinical signs first appear) has been shown to decrease the incidence of chronic lung disease, duration of mechanical ventilation and necrotising enterocolitis when compared with late symptomatic treatment (i.e. after signs of congestive cardiac failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>). Standard therapy for a PDA includes fluid restriction, diuretics and cyclooxygenase inhibitors like indomethacin or ibuprofen, with surgical ligation reserved for medical failures. In 1976, it was first demonstrated that closure of the ductus arteriosus could be achieved pharmacologically using the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heymann-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymann 1976</LINK>). About the same time, Cotton et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978b</LINK>) showed the beneficial effect of surgical intervention to close the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants with a significant left to right shunt.</P>
<P>Efficacy and toxicity of indomethacin and other cyclooxygenase inhibitor drugs have been explored extensively and many variations in dosage regimens have been reported in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 2000</LINK>). Rennie and Cooke (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1991</LINK>) found higher ductal closure rates and fewer renal side effects with low-dose prolonged indomethacin therapy (0.1 mg per kilogram given daily for six days) compared with the conventional three-dose regimen (0.2 mg per kilogram given at 12-hour intervals). A study comparing the efficacy and toxicity of ibuprofen versus indomethacin found similar ductal closure rates in both treatment groups, except that indomethacin was more likely to be associated with oliguria (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 2000</LINK>). There is a risk of failure to close the PDA with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Failure of ductal closure with indomethacin is reported in between 30% to 40% of treated infants (<LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>). This may be more likely in the very immature infant (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trus 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1998</LINK>). Narayanan et al (<LINK REF="REF-Narayanan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narayanan 2000</LINK>) reported that 41% of infants treated with indomethacin for symptomatic PDA and 21% of infants given prophylactic indomethacin required eventual ductal ligation. Indomethacin treatment has been associated with several adverse effects such as transient or permanent alterations in renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Betkerur-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betkerur 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Bel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Bel 1991</LINK>), necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Grosfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosfeld 1996</LINK>) and impairment of cerebral blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1993</LINK>). Indomethacin prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of PDA; however, it does not significantly affect the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:37:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For more than 30 years it has been recognised that a significant left to right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants increases morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Thibeault-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thibeault 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1980</LINK>). The reported incidence of PDA ranges from less than 10% to 60% depending on gestational age, day of life and diagnostic criteria used (<LINK REF="REF-Ellison-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellison 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duddell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duddell 1984</LINK>). A symptomatic PDA may occur in up to 50% of infants with birth weight less than 1500 grams (<LINK REF="REF-Mouzinho-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzinho 1991</LINK>). Infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Thibeault-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thibeault 1975</LINK>), perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1981</LINK>) and those who have received excessive fluids during the first days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1980</LINK>) are more susceptible to the development of a clinically symptomatic PDA. A symptomatic PDA increases the ventilation and oxygen requirements, and increases the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Duddell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duddell 1984</LINK>) and chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1979</LINK>) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The phenomenon of diastolic steal associated with a PDA may cause renal impairment, intestinal ischemias, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and reduced middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Nestrud-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nestrud 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shimada-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimada 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical criteria used for the diagnosis of a symptomatic PDA are the presence of a heart murmur, bounding pulses, tachycardia, hyperdynamic precordial impulse, widened pulse pressure or worsening respiratory status (tachypnoea and increasing fraction of inspired oxygen, ventilatory requirements, or both) (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1995</LINK>). Echocardiographic and Doppler criteria for the confirmation of a symptomatic PDA include the following (<LINK REF="REF-Dani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Carolis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Carolis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2002</LINK>):</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:37:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical ligation in preterm neonates with a symptomatic PDA has been shown to be successful, with minimal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satur-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satur 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pokharel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokharel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>). There are reports suggesting that surgical ligation may be the preferred first line of treatment compared to indomethacin in preterm infants less than 800 grams (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trus 1993</LINK>). One study has shown that a PDA is less likely to close with indomethacin if it is associated with a large LA/AO (left atrial-aortic) ratio on echocardiography and that surgical ligation may be the better option (<LINK REF="REF-Trus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trus 1993</LINK>). Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA and reduces the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency. Given the reduction in NEC noted in the latest Cochrane update, ibuprofen currently appears to be the drug of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>). Studies are needed to evaluate the effect of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin treatment on longer-term outcomes in infants with PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>). The use of ibuprofen versus surgical ligation has not be tested in a randomised controlled trial.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:38:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reported success rates for surgical closure of PDA are 98% to 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). However, occasional failure of surgery to close a symptomatic PDA can occur; for example, if the ductal clip is malpositioned or dislodged (<LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). Some investigators have reported significant complications associated with surgical ligation including tension pneumothorax, hypothermia, intraoperative bleeding, phrenic nerve palsy, wound infection, vocal cord palsy and thoracic scoliosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mikhail-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikhail 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zbar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zbar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seghaye-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seghaye 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). In a retrospective study comparing indomethacin with surgical ligation, the overall fatality rates were found to be 16 of 101 (16%) for indomethacin and 14 of 55 (25%) for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). Although open surgical division is a safe and reliable procedure, concerns about chest wall deformity (<LINK REF="REF-Westfelt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westfelt 1991</LINK>) and postoperative pain syndromes associated with standard posterolateral thoracotomy have motivated a search for a less traumatic approach. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a recent advancement in surgical management of PDA, uses endoscopic instruments through 3 mm incisions in the chest wall to approach the PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-17 10:03:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although both surgical and pharmacological interventions for ductal closure are widely used, morbidity and mortality associated with these therapies have not been systematically reviewed. Even though there may be a general consensus to use indomethacin as the initial therapy for a symptomatic PDA, and to reserve surgical ligation for indomethacin failures, this therapeutic approach may not represent the optimal management for PDA in the extremely preterm neonate.</P>

<P>Three studies assessing the effect of surgical ligation versus medical treatment as a primary treatment for closure of symptomatic PDA in preterm infants were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Levitsky-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Levitsky 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>). All these studies were published as full-text articles. However, the studies by Levitsky et al and Cotton et al were excluded because cyclooxygenase inhibitors were not a part of the medical treatment protocol, which consisted only of fluid restriction and digoxin. The study performed by <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> includes a report of two trials, trial A and trial B; trial B was eligible for inclusion in this review. The updated literature searches in July 2007 and February 2012 did not identify any additional studies for inclusion.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>, 421 preterm infants weighing &lt; 1750 grams with symptomatic PDA were entered to evaluate the role of indomethacin. Randomisation was done at two stages. In stage one (trial A), infants with symptomatic PDA were randomised to either indomethacin or placebo. In addition, both the groups received usual medical management (fluid restriction, diuretics and/or digoxin). In stage two (trial B) infants in the placebo arm of trial A whose PDA remained symptomatic (increased pulse pressure and positive findings on echocardiogram or chest radiograph) and who required significant respiratory support (assisted ventilation for seven or more consecutive days, deteriorating respiratory status or inability to decrease level of respiratory support over a 72-hour period despite maximum medical therapy) were randomised to either surgical closure of PDA or indomethacin treatment. Clinical and echocardiographic criteria were used to diagnose PDA for study entry and to assess the response of treatment groups. Outcome variables measured included ductal closure rate, mortality before hospital discharge, incidences of adverse conditions during hospitalisation, length of hospital stay and duration of respiratory support. Outcomes for all 421 infants were reported. Trial B included 154 infants (79 randomised to the surgical group and 75 to the indomethacin group). Trial B of this larger study is relevant to this review and hence the outcomes of trial B are reviewed.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-19 20:08:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study, trial B in <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>, was eligible for inclusion in this review. Updated searches of the literature in July 2007 and February 2012 did not identify any additional studies. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> compared the effect of surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) versus medical treatment with indomethacin, each used as the initial treatment after failure of placebo and usual medical management in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA. This trial found no statistically significant difference in mortality at discharge between the two groups.</P>
<P>Trial B of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> found a statistically significant decrease in the failure of ductal closure rate in the surgical group as compared to the indomethacin group (1% versus 30%). However, it is important to note here that PDAs that closed spontaneously in Trial A (35% in the placebo group) would have been attributed to indomethacin if indomethacin had been the primary treatment. Thus, the difference in closure rates between the surgery and indomethacin groups observed in Trial B likely underestimates the difference that would have been observed if trial entry had occurred earlier.</P>
<P>Trial B of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> found significantly higher incidences of pneumothorax and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) of stage III and IV in the surgical ligation group compared to the indomethacin group. The incidence of pneumothorax reported in the study by Gersony et al is higher in both groups as compared to incidences reported in other retrospective and prospective studies. The incidence of pneumothorax reported with surgical closure in other studies varies between 6% to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satur-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satur 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). The higher incidences of pneumothorax found in the study by Gersony et al may be due to delayed intervention or due to the surgery itself. The surgical technique of PDA ligation is at the discretion of the surgeon and some surgeons perform extrapleural dissection in an effort to avoid the need for an intercostal drain postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Palder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palder 1987</LINK>). Others use a transpleural approach, with care to avoid disrupting the visceral pleura and thus avoid the need for an intercostal drain (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 1995</LINK>). Some surgeons use an intrapleural approach to the PDA and routinely insert a chest drain postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Niinikoski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niinikoski 2001</LINK>). Gersony et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK>) did not describe the surgical technique in the report, making it difficult to comment on the aetiology of pneumothorax.</P>
<P>Trial B of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> found a significantly higher incidence of ROP of stage III and IV in the surgical ligation group compared to the indomethacin group. The incidence of ROP reported with surgical closure varies between 1% to 10% in other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satur-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satur 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koehne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehne 2001</LINK>). This particular finding had not been noted by other clinicians using indomethacin or surgical closure. No biologically plausible explanation for this association in the study by Gersony et al is apparent.</P>
<P>Trial B of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> found no statistically significant difference in other morbidity variables (chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), other bleeding, sepsis, creatinine clearance, duration of hospital stay, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) or duration of mechanical ventilation). The duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay were measured from admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and not from the day of randomisation in Trial B. The two could be quite different if randomisation in trial B was rather late.</P>

<P>We were surprised at the paucity of trials comparing surgical versus medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. There are several possible reasons for this.<BR/>

<P>Trial B of <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> has the following limitations as far as the objectives of this review are concerned.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The report makes no comments on the postnatal age at which infants were randomised to the indomethacin group or the surgical ligation group. In Trial A one-third of the infants were randomised after 10 days, so the postnatal age at entry to trial B would be greater, perhaps by two to seven or more days. Therefore, interventions in both groups were delayed after the initial diagnosis of symptomatic PDA, as both groups received initial treatment with placebo. This raises the question as to how much the delay in intervention influenced effects on morbidity and mortality.</LI>
<LI>The demographic characteristics (birth weight, gestational age and sex) for the infants in the two arms of trial B included in this review were not separately identified.</LI>
<LI>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1983</LINK> was performed 30 years ago and the practice of neonatology has changed considerably since then. The surgical techniques have also changed. With better intraoperative thermal protection and safer anaesthetic agents, the mortality associated with surgical ligation of PDA has decreased in the last decade. Therefore, it is debatable whether the results of the study are applicable today.</LI>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-02-19 20:09:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies addressed the possible association between surgical closure of a PDA and neurosensory impairments, CLD or both (<LINK REF="REF-Chorne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chorne 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raval-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raval 2007</LINK>). Kabra et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2007</LINK>) studied 426 infants with a symptomatic PDA, 110 of whom underwent PDA ligation and 316 of whom received medical therapy only. All infants were enrolled in the multicentre Trial of Indomethacin Prophylaxis in Preterms (TIPP) and were observed to a corrected age of 18 months. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) comparing those who survived after PDA ligation (n = 95) compared to those who survived after receiving medical therapy only (n = 245) for neurosensory impairment was 1.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 3.30), for CLD was 1.81 (95% CI 1.19 to 3.03) and for severe ROP was 2.20 (95% CI 1.19 to 4.07). Raval et al (<LINK REF="REF-Raval-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raval 2007</LINK>) conducted a retrospective review of 197 infants less than 38 weeks of postmenstrual age, undergoing PDA ligation via thoracotomy between 1 January 1992 and 1 January 2004. Only 44 (22%) survived to discharge without CLD (defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age). In a retrospective cohort study Chorne et al (<LINK REF="REF-Chorne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chorne 2007</LINK>) included all infants (&lt; 28 weeks gestation) admitted to the William H. Tooley Nursery at University of California, San Francisco and who were treated according to a PDA care-oriented protocol, which included prophylactic indomethacin. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effects of several PDA-related variables (presence of symptomatic PDA, the number of indomethacin doses used, the ductus response to indomethacin, and the use of surgical ligation) on the incidence of ROP, NEC, CLD, death and neurodevelopmental impairment. Most of the predictive effects that the presence of a PDA and its treatment had on neonatal morbidity could be accounted for by the infants' immature gestation. Use of surgical ligation was significantly associated with the development of CLD (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.57) and was independent of immature gestation, other PDA-related variables or other perinatal and neonatal risk factors known to be associated with CLD. The corresponding adjusted OR for ROP was 1.00 (95% CI 0.45 to 2.21), for neurodevelopmental impairment or death was 1.18 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.49) and for NEC was 1.19 (95% CI 0.61 to 2.33). Although the study design was not a randomised controlled trial comparing surgical to medical closure of a PDA, the findings in these three studies suggest an increased risk of one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation: chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity and neurosensory impairment. It is possible that the duration of the 'waiting time' and transport to another facility with surgical capacity to have the PDA ligated could adversely affect outcomes, as could perioperative care.</P>
<P>Jhaveri et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jhaveri-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jhaveri 2010</LINK>) reported that in January 2005 at the Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, they changed their approach to infants born at age <U>&lt;</U> 27 weeks gestation who failed indomethacin treatment. They changed from an early surgical approach, in which feedings were stopped and all PDAs were ligated (period 1: January 1999 to December 2004; n = 216) to a more conservative approach in which feedings continued and PDAs were ligated only if cardiopulmonary compromise developed (period 2: January 2005 to August 2009; n = 180). All infants in both periods received prophylactic indomethacin therapy. The two periods had similar rates of perinatal/neonatal risk factors and indomethacin failure (24%), as well as ventilator management and feeding advance protocols. The conservative approach (period 2) was associated with decreased rates of duct ligation (72% versus 100%; P &lt; 0.05). Even though infants subjected to this approach were exposed to larger PDA shunts for longer durations, the rates of CLD, sepsis, ROP, neurologic injury and death were similar to those in period 1. The overall rate of NEC was significantly lower in period 2 compared with period 1. Their findings support the need for randomised controlled trials to re-examine the benefits and risks of different approaches to PDA treatment.</P>

<P>The results of this review, which includes data from only one clinical trial, do not allow development of clear guidelines for the initial treatment of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. The data are insufficient regarding net benefit/harm to make a conclusion as to whether surgical ligation or medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors is preferable as initial treatment for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. There are concerns about an increased risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and chronic lung disease (CLD) following PDA ligation based on the study included in this review. It should be noted that three out of four observational studies indicated an increased risk for one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation: CLD, ROP and neurosensory impairment. It is possible that the duration of the 'waiting time' and transport to another facility with surgical capacity to have the PDA ligated could adversely affect outcomes, as could the perioperative care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-19 20:10:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should be directed toward addressing the question of whether surgical ligation is preferred to indomethacin for closure of a symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. The rationale for the study question includes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>lack of randomised controlled trials in this field;</LI>
<LI>some retrospective studies suggesting better outcomes in extremely low birth weight infants with surgical ligation compared to indomethacin therapy (however, three out of four observational studies indicated an increased risk for one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation: CLD, ROP and neurosensory impairment);</LI>
<LI>morbidity (necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and renal side effects) and failure of the ductus to close are still concerns associated with indomethacin treatment;</LI>
<LI>closure of PDA remains unpredictable after indomethacin treatment as compared to the definitive effect of surgical ligation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The important subgroups will be extremely low birth weight infants and infants with a large PDA with a left atrial to aortic ratio of more than 1.5 on echocardiography, because of high failure rate of ductal closure associated with indomethacin treatment in these infants. The study should evaluate short-term outcomes such as death and pulmonary morbidity, as well as clinically significant long-term outcomes such as neurodevelopmental status and CLD.</P>
