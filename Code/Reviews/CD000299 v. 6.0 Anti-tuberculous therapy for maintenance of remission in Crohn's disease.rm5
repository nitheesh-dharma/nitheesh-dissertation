<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-07-21 09:19:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Tuberculous bacteria have been suggested as a possible cause of Crohn's disease due to a similarity between Crohn's and tuberculous lesions when viewed under a microscope. Four studies examined the use of anti-tuberculous therapy to reduce the chance of the disease recurring in patients with non-active Crohn's disease. The results of these studies suggest that this treatment might be effective for this purpose. However, this finding has not been definitively proven, and anti-tuberculous therapy should not be used to treat Crohn's disease without further study.</P>
<P>
<B>What is Crohn's disease? </B>
</P>
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect people of any age. Common symptoms include weight loss, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. When people with Crohn's disease experience these symptoms the disease is active. When patients no longer experience disease symptoms their disease is said to be in remission.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>Prevention of relapse (recurrence of symptoms) is an important objective in the management of Crohn's disease. There is no current treatment available that completely prevents relapse and is without significant side-effects. Tuberculous bacteria have been suggested as a possible cause of Crohn's disease due to a similarity between Crohn's and tuberculous lesions when viewed under a microscope. We wanted to see if anti-tuberculous therapy is better than placebo for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease</P>
<P>
<B>What is anti-tuberculous therapy? </B>
</P>
<P>Anti-tuberculous therapy generally consists of combinations of antibiotic and antibacterial type drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate? </B>
</P>
<P>The researchers studied whether anti-tuberculous therapy maintains remission in patients with Crohn's disease and whether it causes any harms (side effects). The investigators searched the medical literature extensively up to 22 June 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find? </B>
</P>
<P>The researchers identified four studies that included a total of 206 participants. All of the studies were small in size and were judged to be of unclear quality. The studies compared anti-tuberculous therapy (i.e. clofazimine or combination therapy with clofazimine, rifampin, ethambutol, and dapsone or combination therapy with clarithromycin, rifabutin and clofazimine) to placebo (inactive pills or tablets). Anti-tuberculous therapy may provide a benefit over placebo for the prevention of relapse in participants with Crohn's disease in remission. However, this result is very uncertain due to unclear study quality and the small numbers of patients assessed. Participants receiving anti-tuberculous drugs had more side effects than placebo participants. Common side effects included reversible pink skin discolouration and rash. No serious side effects were reported in the four studies. Further studies are needed to provide better quality evidence for the use of anti-tuberculous therapy for maintaining remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-tuberculous therapy compared to placebo or another active therapy in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:45:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>At least two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.. The primary outcome was relapse. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events. All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-21 09:19:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Four placebo-controlled RCTs including 206 participants were included. Three trials included an 8 to 16 week induction phase with tapering corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone) as induction therapy. Anti-tuberculous therapy included monotherapy with clofazimine, combination therapy with clofazimine, rifampin, ethambutol, and dapsone or combination therapy with clarithromycin, rifabutin and clofazimine. All of the studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, three were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and two were rated as unclear risk of bias for blinding or participants and personnel. There was a statistically significant difference in relapse rates favoring anti-tuberculous therapy over placebo. Thirty-nine per cent (44/112) of patients in the anti-tuberculous therapy group relapsed at 9 months to 2 years compared to 67% (63/94) of placebo patients (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias and sparse data. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the anti-tuberculous therapy group (37/159) compared to the placebo group (14/163) with a pooled RR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.45 to 4.55; N=322; studies=4, I<SUP>2</SUP>=64%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity and sparse data. There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Nine per cent (14/159) of anti-tuberculous therapy patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 7% (11/163) of placebo patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.77, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Common adverse events included increased skin pigmentation and rashes. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:46:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The etiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown. A variety of possible causes have been proposed, including mycobacterial infection. Dalziel first noted similarities between Crohn's disease and tuberculous gastroenteritis in 1913 (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-1913" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 1913</LINK>). However, attempts to culture mycobacteria from Crohn's disease patients were unsuccessful until 1978 when Burnham reported the culture of <I>Mycobacterium kansasii</I> from lymph nodes of a Crohn's patient (<LINK REF="REF-Burnham-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnham 1978</LINK>). More recently, Sanderson has used PCR and a specific DNA probe to detect <I>Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</I> in up to two thirds of Crohn's disease tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 1991a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 1991b</LINK>). Of interest is a histopathological similarity between Crohn's disease and Johne's disease, an infectious enteritis in ruminants caused by <I>Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of studies examined the effect of anti-tuberculous therapy in Crohn's disease, reporting conflicting results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of anti-tuberculous therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Borgaonkar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borgaonkar 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>We utilized the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes. Evidence from randomized controlled trials begin as high quality evidence but can be downgraded due to: risk of bias, indirect evidence, inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), imprecision, and publication bias. The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was ascertained and classified as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate quality (i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); and very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-07-21 09:19:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>When studies reported multiple observations for the same outcome, the outcomes were combined for fixed intervals of follow-up (e.g., relapse at 52 weeks). Cross-over trials were only included if data were available from the first phase of the study (i.e., before any cross-over). Separate analyses were to be conducted for comparisons between anti-tuberculous therapy versus placebo as well as comparisons with active comparators. Where studies allocated subjects to more than one anti-tuberculous treatment arm, the arms would be pooled for the primary analysis. When possible, subgroup analyses were to be performed to compare efficacy and safety among different doses of anti-tuberculous drugs. Although some studies may report more than one efficacy or safety event per patient, the primary analysis considered the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event. Studies with induction phases were considered for inclusion, but analysis for relapse only included participants who entered the maintenance phase. Analysis of adverse events, withdrawals as a result of adverse events and serious adverse events were performed using all participants across all study phases.</P>

<P>We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. A P value of 0.1 was considered to be statistically significant. The degree of statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Heterogeneity was considered to be moderate if I<SUP>2</SUP> was &gt; 50%, and high if I<SUP>2</SUP> was &gt; 75%. We explored potential explanations for heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and by sensitivity analysis excluding any outlier studies. To account for the heterogeneity, we also examined the characteristics of potential outlier studies to see if these studies differed in any way from the other studies in the pooled analysis.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-05 11:21:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Protocols were not available for the included studies. We evaluated reporting bias by comparing the reported outcomes listed in the methods section of the manuscript to those described in the results section. There were less than 10 included studies and therefore publication bias could not be evaluated using funnel plots.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:46:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% CI using a fixed-effect model. Data from individual trials were pooled for meta-analysis if included studies were similar in regards to patients, treatments and outcomes (determined by consensus). If significant heterogeneity was identified, we used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. If heterogeneity was substantially high (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 75%) and a single study that was causing the heterogeneity was identified, it was excluded from pooled meta-analysis. The primary analysis was to be confined to those trials which were fully published. A sensitivity analysis was to be carried out which included trials in abstract form. A subgroup analysis was to be performed on those trials in which patients were initially brought into remission with corticosteroids. However, only one small study reported as an abstract was available and almost all patients were induced into remission with corticosteroids, so these analyses were not performed as they would not have affected the results.</P>

Failure of phase 1 in either group occurred if the patient did not enter remission or could not be tapered off steroids, and these patients were prohibited from inclusion in the next phase. Phase 2 (intervention group (n = 16) and placebo group (n = 12)) continued the patients with 100 mg daily clofazimine or matched daily placebo for another month with the primary outcome of maintaining remission (DAS &lt; 5). Failure of phase 2 occurred if the patients relapsed within the time frame, which prohibited their inclusion in phase 3. Phase 3 (intervention group (n = 15) and placebo group (n = 12)) continued the patients on 100 mg daily clofazimine or matched daily placebo for another 8 months with the primary outcome of maintaining remission (DAS &lt; 5). Failure of phase 3 occurred if the patients relapsed within the time frame. The effect disease location on outcomes and adverse effects of clofazimine were also reported.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kelleher-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kelleher 1982</LINK> conducted a randomized, placebo controlled trial of 20 patients with Crohn's disease in remission to evaluate the effectiveness of clofazimine (dose regimen was not described) at maintaining remission. Patients discontinued any pre-existing treatment for the first four weeks of the six month study period. Disease activity was monitored as the primary outcome using the CDAI. The primary outcome was relapse. Secondary outcomes included toxic effects of clofazimine monitored by biochemical and hematological screening and clinical adverse effects of treatment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1994</LINK> conducted a nine month randomized, double-blind, matched placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of antimycobacterial therapies [clofazimine (100 mg every 2 days for 9 months), rifampin (600 mg, 1 dose taken at trial entry), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/day for 9 months) and dapsone (100 mg, 6 days per week for 9 months)] compared to an identically matched placebo, both paired with an eight week-tapered course of methylprednisolone for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. Patients (N = 40) selected for the study had to have active disease with CDAI &gt; 250 and had been on specific steroid regimes, but were excluded if &lt; 18 years old; pregnant or breastfeeding; had intestinal stenosis (with obstructive symptoms); diabetes mellitus; significant hepatic or renal disease; had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; had TPN or elemental diet; or had radiographic findings of active pulmonary TB. Patients who entered remission were entered into the maintenance phase where the patients were continued on their previously started drug regime. Failure, at any time, was defined as a need for corticosteroids, other drug therapy or surgery based on clinical symptoms and signs. Placebo patients who failed were offered open-label antimycobacterial therapy, including the eight week tapered course of corticosteroids. The primary outcomes were induction of remission and maintenance of remission of CD, without symptoms or complications and endoscopic or radiologic disappearance or active inflammatory lesions. Other evaluated variables included visual acuity changes, compliance, side effects, toxicity and follow-up.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Selby-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2007</LINK> conducted a three year, three phase, prospective, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the potential long-term benefits of two years of treatment with a combination of antibiotics for maintaining remission after an initial remission induction phase with tapering adjunct corticosteroids. The phases included: induction phase (16 weeks), maintenance phase (16-104 weeks) and follow-up phase (104-156 weeks). The combination therapy was clarithromycin (750 mg/day), rifabutin (450 mg/day), and clofazimine (50 mg/day), which each had an initial step-wise dosing regimen to prevent adverse events. Two-hundred and thirteen adult patients (age &gt; 18 years) with active Crohn's disease (CDAI &gt; 200) diagnosed with standard criteria, from 20 Australian centres were selected. Patients were excluded if they met the following conditions: isolated upper gastrointestinal or isolated perianal disease or a stoma; need for intravenous corticosteroids at initial assessment; expected need for surgery during the first four months of the study; antibiotic use for Crohn&#8217;s disease within one month of study entry; prior use of infliximab. Primary outcomes of the study were the proportions of patients with at least 1 relapse at 12, 24 and 36 months. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients in remission (CDAI &lt; 150) at week 16; number of patients who relapsed by predetermined time periods; length of time to first relapse; intervention and placebo safety profiles; other outcomes (improvements in Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) scores, proportion of subjects requiring Crohn's related-surgery); laboratory profile changes (serum albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)); and quality of life scores (questionnaires). Other outcomes monitored were the proportion of patients in endoscopic remission at week 156; patient compliance with the drug regimen; and maintenance of blinding.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:52:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Pooled analysis was performed evaluating the studies for relapse, and safety data, including adverse events, withdrawal as a result of adverse events, and serious adverse events. Interventions in the studies included anti-tuberculous treatments as mono or combined therapies, in isolation or following adjunct therapy with corticosteroids to induce remission. Relapse was defined by the individual studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Occurence of relapse during maintenance therapy</B>
<BR/>There was a statistically significant difference in relapse rates favoring anti-tuberculous therapy over placebo. Thirty-nine per cent (44/112) of patients in the anti-tuberculous therapy group relapsed at 9 months to 2 years compared to 67% (63/94) of placebo patients (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias and sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events</B>
<BR/>Adverse events occurred more frequently in the anti-tuberculous therapy group (37/159) compared to the placebo group (14/163) with a pooled RR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.45 to 4.55; N=322; studies=4, I<SUP>2</SUP>=64%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity and sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Common adverse events included increased skin pigmentation and rashes. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. There was no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Nine per cent (14/159) of patients in the anti-tuberculous therapy group withdrew due to adverse events compared to 7% (11/163) of placebo patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.77; N = 322; studies = 4; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias and very sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Afdhal-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Afdhal 1991</LINK> reported that adverse events were mild and self-limiting. Twelve patients in the clofazimine group had increased skin pigmentation compared to five patients in the placebo group. Three patients in the clofazimine group developed skin rashes and no patients had abnormal eye exams. Two patients in each group asked to be withdrawn without specific reasons given, but were not included as failures. No serious adverse events were reported.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 13:17:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The electronic search of the databases resulted in six reports of four studies (N=206), which were included in the meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect of anti-tuberculous therapy for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Pooled risk ratios were calculated for relapse and safety outcomes (adverse events, withdrawals as a result of adverse events and serious adverse events). Four studies examined anti-tuberculous therapy for maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The pooled RR for relapse was 0.58 (95% CI 0.45-0.75; N=206; studies=4, I<SUP>2</SUP>=47%), suggesting a potential benefit for anti-tuberculous therapy compared to placebo. Although patients in the anti-tuberculous therapy group were significantly more likely than placebo patients to experience an adverse event, there was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Common adverse events included increased skin pigmentation and rashes. None of the included studies reported any serious adverse events. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:58:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The included studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for several important quality indicators. None of the included studies adequately described methods used for allocation concealment and the studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for that item. Only one study described the method used for random sequence generation and this study was rated as low risk of bias. The other three studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation. Two studies did not describe procedures used for double-blinding and were rated as unclear risk of bias for blinding. GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this systematic review (i.e. relapse and safety outcomes) was very low due to unclear risk of bias, serious imprecision and unexplained heterogeneity.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-07-18 12:58:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>In an attempt to reduce the potential for bias in the review process we performed a comprehensive literature search to identify all eligible studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed study quality. There are some limitations to this review. The studies were small, underpowered and of unclear methodological quality. Futhermore the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review was very low. Thus any conclusions generated from this review need to be interpreted with caution. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-18 13:05:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Very low quality evidence suggests that anti-tuberculous therapy may be effective for maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Most of the included patients were initially treated with a course of corticosteroids combined with anti-tuberculous drugs to induce remission. It is unknown if anti-tuberculous therapy would be effective in patients brought into remission with other medical or surgical therapies. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-18 13:05:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although the results are not definitive, they do support further trials using anti-tuberculous drugs for Crohn's disease, including studies using a combination of corticosteroids and anti-tuberculous agents to induce remission followed by maintenance therapy with anti-tuberculous agents, as well as other medical and surgical therapies used to induce remission followed by maintenance therapy with anti-tuberculous agents. These studies will provide better quality evidence for the use of anti-tuberculous therapy for maintaining remission in people with quiescent Crohn's disease. </P>
