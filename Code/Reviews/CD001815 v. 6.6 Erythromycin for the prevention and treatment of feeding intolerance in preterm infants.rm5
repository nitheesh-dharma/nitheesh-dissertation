<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-09 11:26:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to show any benefit from erythromycin used in large or small doses for the prevention or treatment of feeding problems in premature infants. Premature infants who need intensive care often have feeding problems. Frequently, some food stays in the stomach without being digested. Earlier feeding can facilitate normal development of the gastrointestinal tract and can avoid health problems related to feeding by intravenous lines. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that has an effect on the gastrointestinal tract and may help infants with feeding problems. However, this review found that there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in small or large doses to prevent or treat premature infants with feeding problems.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-09 11:24:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial selection criteria limited the review to studies using erythromycin at 3 - 12 mg/kg/day in preterm infants less than 36 weeks gestational age with feeding tolerance. However, a significant number of studies using erythromycin at a higher dose (&gt; 12 mg/kg/day) or as prophylaxis for those at risk of feeding intolerance were identified. A <I>post hoc</I> decision was made to include these studies in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-27 15:33:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were categorized into prevention and treatment studies, and data from each category were analyzed separately. Within each category, subgroup analyses were performed based on low (3 to 12mg/kg/day) and high doses (&gt; 12mg/kg/day) of erythromycin. Primary outcome was days to full enteral feeding. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects associated with erythromycin, duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), weight gain, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and length of hospital stay.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-09 11:25:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten randomized controlled studies (three prevention and seven treatment studies) were included. Studies varied greatly in the definition of feeding intolerance and how outcomes were measured, analyzed and reported, so meta-analysis of most outcomes was impossible. It was observed, however, that the studies using erythromycin at higher treatment doses (40 to 50 mg/kg/day) or in infants &gt; 32 weeks' GA reported more positive effects in improving feeding intolerance.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of high dose prevention studies showed no significant difference in NEC (typical RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.11, 3.01; typical RD -0.021, 95% CI -0.087, 0.045). Meta-analysis of high dose treatment studies showed no significant difference in septicemia (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.17, 0.08).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in low or high doses for preterm infants with or at risk of feeding intolerance.

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-09 12:37:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-09 11:30:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feeding intolerance is a common problem in preterm infants undergoing intensive care. It usually manifests as residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding and may be associated with abdominal distension, bile-stained aspirates, or lack of stooling. The slow advancement of enteral feeding often leads to prolonged use of parenteral nutrition, which predisposes the infants to nosocomial infections, hepatic dysfunction, and prolonged hospitalization.<BR/>
<BR/>The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract is important for its structural and functional integrity. It has been shown in animal studies that enteral nutrition promotes gastrointestinal cell growth directly via a trophic effect and indirectly via stimulation of local hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1983</LINK>). Thus, early establishment of full enteral feeding may have physiologic advantages for the infant.</P>
<P>During the interdigestive period, adults as well as term infants exhibit multi-phasic cycles of intestinal motor activity, termed migratory motor complex (MMC). Physiologic studies have shown a lack of the propagative phase III of the MMC in the duodenum of preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-al-Tawil-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">al Tawil 1996</LINK>). These infants' interdigestive activity consists of random periods of quiescence and non-propagated contractions. This functional immaturity predisposes them to feeding intolerance. Further studies have shown that gastrointestinal motility matures as gestational age increases (<LINK REF="REF-Tomomasa-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomomasa 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berseth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berseth 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berseth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berseth 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Motilin, a gastrointestinal peptide, stimulates propagative contractile activity during phase III of the MMC in the interdigestive state. <I>In-vitro</I> studies have shown that erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic commonly used in preterm infants for treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection, is a motilin agonist (<LINK REF="REF-Peeters-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 1989</LINK>). Its prokinetic effect is seen at doses much lower than the antimicrobial dose in humans. Animal studies have shown that the prokinetic effect of erythromycin is dose dependent. At a low intravenous dose (1mg/kg), erythromycin has been shown to induce phase III of the MMC along the small intestine. At higher doses (7 to 10 mg/kg), however, erythromycin has been shown to cause sustained contractile activity in the small intestine, followed by a prolonged disruption of the baseline MMC (<LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zara-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zara 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otterson 1990</LINK>). In clinical studies, erythromycin has been shown to improve gastric motility in children with postoperative intestinal dysmotility and in children with neuropathic pseudo-intestinal obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Simkiss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkiss 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1990</LINK>). It has also been shown to be an effective aid for postpyloric intubation (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Lorenzo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Lorenzo 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a limited number of gastrointestinal motility agents currently available. Cisapride was commonly used to promote gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants. However, because of concerns regarding the development of prolonged QT interval and arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 1996</LINK>), this drug is no longer recommended for use in this population.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of erythromycin in the prevention and treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants.</P>
<P>This review updates the existing review of erythromycin for feeding intolerance in preterm infants originally published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2000.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials of erythromycin treatment in preterm infants were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2007, MEDLINE (1966 - December 2007) using the MeSH headings: Erythromycin, infant, newborn; infant, premature; gastrointestinal motility or gastric emptying; motilin; prokinetic agent.tw, EMBASE (1980 - December 2007), CINAHL (1982 - December 2007) and clinical trial registries (www.clinicaltrials.gov;www.controlled-trials.com). Relevant medical journals, bibliographies of articles from the database search, personal files, scientific meeting proceedings, and abstracts published in Pediatric Research (1990 - 2007) were manually searched. Language restrictions were not applied. Attempts were made to contact investigators of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to gather additional data for analysis.

<P>Sixteen studies were identified, including 14 published manuscripts and two abstracts. One of the published manuscripts (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) and one of the abstracts (Almonte 1999) were reports of the same study; this study is referred to as Patole 2002. Two studies were excluded because of their design as crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-Costalos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Costalos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costalos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costalos 2002</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nogami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nogami 2001</LINK>) was excluded because treatment assignment was not randomized (treatment or placebo was given based on the time period during which they were recruited). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 2004</LINK>) was excluded because it only involved infants with post-operative gastroschisis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jadcherla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jadcherla 2002</LINK>) was excluded because it was a dose-response study with no placebo group included. Ten eligible randomized controlled trials were included in this review.</P>
<P>These ten studies used different inclusion criteria and used erythromycin in variable doses in different clinical settings. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) used low dose erythromycin (3 to12 mg/kg/day) as the study drug for preterm infants with feeding intolerance and thus fulfilled the <I>a priori</I> inclusion criteria for this review. The other seven studies did not meet the initial inclusion criteria, either because of the use of high dose erythromycin (&gt; 12mg/kg/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) and/or because erythromycin was used as a prophylactic treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>). Nonetheless, since these studies were still relevant to the objective of this review and might contribute to the knowledge of how erythromycin might be used to promote enteral feeding in preterm infants, a <I>post hoc</I> decision was made to broaden the scope of the review to include these studies.</P>
<P>For the description of studies and analyses of relevant outcome data, these included studies were grouped based on the clinical settings where erythromycin was used: <I>Prevention</I> (for at risk infants prior to or at initiation of feeds) and <I>Treatment</I> (for infants who exhibit signs of feeding intolerance). Where possible, subgroup comparisons of outcomes from studies using <I>Low dose</I> (defined <I>a priori</I> as 3-12mg/kg/day) versus <I>High dose</I> (&gt; 12mg/kg/day) erythromycin were made.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK> (45mg/kg/day): Seventy-five ventilated preterm infants with GA &#8804; 30 weeks were enrolled at birth to determine the effect of erythromycin on reducing the early inflammatory response and, subsequently, the occurrence and severity of chronic lung disease in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lyon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyon 1998</LINK>). In a separate publication, Stenson (1998) reported the effect of erythromycin on establishment of enteral feeding in this study population. A discrepancy between the two publications (<LINK REF="REF-Lyon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) was noted in the number of infants reported [76 in Stenson (1998) vs. 75 in Lyon (1998)]. The infants were randomly assigned to receive erythromycin or standard treatment without erythromycin or a placebo. Erythromycin was started on day one at 15mg/kg/dose given intravenously three times daily (45 mg/kg/day) for seven days. The infants were fed according to a standardized protocol. The primary goal was to compare the concentration of inflammatory cytokines (interleukins IL-1 beta and IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha) in the treatment and control groups. Secondary outcomes included time to full enteral feed (defined as the point when milk intake of at least 150 ml/kg/day was given enterally), feed tolerance as evaluated by net enteral balance (nasogastric feed volume minus nasogastric feed residual volume) for the first 14 days of age, number of infants who vomited, number of glycerin suppositories given because of concern for delayed passage of meconium, and incidence of NEC. Data on feeding pattern were obtained from review of the nursing and medical records after the infant was discharged from the nursery. The staff responsible for the infants' feeding were not aware that the feeding pattern would be studied at a later date. Outcomes were reported on all 76 infants.</P>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>: Twenty-five infants were enrolled into the erythromycin group, and 25 in the placebo group. One infant in each group was withdrawn prior to the start of the study because of withdrawal of parental consent. Two infants in the placebo group were given cisapride during the trial due to recurrent vomiting and were taken out of the study. One infant in the erythromycin group was transferred back to the referring hospital before full feed was established. Finally, 1 infant in each group died of NEC and sepsis before feeding was established. The author reported data on the remaining 43 infants (22 in the erythromycin group and 21 in the placebo group). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>: Thirty five infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group and 41 in the control group. All infants were enrolled at birth. The two groups were similar in their demographic characteristics, except that the control group had a much higher male: female ratio than the treatment group (18/17 vs. 30/11, p = 0.05). Infants in the erythromycin group and the control group were started on enteral feedings at a similar median age of 3 (IQR 2 to 4) vs. 3 (IQR 2 to 5) days, p = 0.34.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>: Thirty six infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group and 37 in the placebo group.

Infants in the the treatment and placebo groups were started on enteral feedings at a similar median age of 5 (IQR 3 to 7.7) vs. 5 (IQR 3 to 7.5) days, p = 0.84.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Time to established full enteral feeds</B>
<BR/>Using low dose erythromycin (10 mg/kg/day), Oei (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>) showed that infants in the erythromycin group achieved full feeds significant earlier than the placebo group [mean (SD) days to establish full feeds of 6.0 (2.3) vs. 7.9 (3.5) days, p = 0.04]. However, the other two studies using high dose erythromycin (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) failed to show any significant difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in days to achieve full feeds [median (IQR) of 8 (5 to 12) vs. 9 (6 to 14) days, p = 0.45] in <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK> and [median (IQR) of 3.9 (3.4 to 5.9) vs. 4.3 (3.4 to 6.8) days, p = 0.6] in <LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>. In addition, Patole (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) found no significant difference between the treatment and placebo group in age at full feeds [median (IQR) of 9.5 (7 to 13) vs.11 (7 to 16) days of age, p = 0.9].</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this primary outcome could not be performed because data in all but one study were reported as median and interquartile range. Studies were also different in the dose and duration of erythromycin used.</P>

<B>3. Duration of TPN</B>
</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>) reported on the duration of TPN, which was not different between the erythromycin and placebo group during the study period [mean (SD) of 4.6 (5.1) vs. 4.0 (3.9) days, p = 0.68].</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) reported on weight gain. In the study by Oei (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>), there was no difference in the time to regain birth weight between the erythromycin and placebo groups [mean (SD) of 14.9 (2.6) vs.15.3 (6.6) days, p = 0.83]. Similarly, Patole (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) did not find a statistically significant difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in median (IQR) weight gain from birth to discharge [425 (162.5 to 1190) vs. 715 (450 to 1117) grams, p = 0.15].</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this outcome could not be performed because one of the two studies reported this outcome in median and interquartile range, and because of the difference in the way weight gain was defined and reported in the two studies.</P>

<BR/>All three studies reported on NEC. In the study by Oei (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>), one infant in each of the erythromycin and placebo group developed NEC. However, they were excluded from further analysis in the study. NEC was defined by pneumatosis intestinalis on radiograph or by findings on laparotomy in the two remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>). In the study by Patole (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>), none of the infants developed NEC during the study period. In the study by Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>), no significant difference in the number of infants with NEC was noted between the erythromycin and placebo group [2 (6%) vs. 4 (10%), p = 0.41].</P>
<P>Meta-analyses of this outcome from the two studies that reported on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) showed no difference in the incidence of NEC between erythromycin and placebo group. (typical risk ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 3.01; typical risk difference -0.02; 95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.05).</P>

<B>7. Duration of hospitalization</B>
</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Patole-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patole 2000</LINK>) reported on this outcome and found no difference in duration of hospitalization [43 (30.5-57) vs. 46 (23.7-69) days, p=0.89] between the erythromycin and placebo group.</P>

<B>8. Other outcomes</B>
<BR/>Studies by Oei (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>) and Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) reported on the incidence of feeding intolerance, although the definition of feeding tolerance differed in the two studies. Oei (<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK>) reported a significantly lower number of gastric aspirates (&gt; 30% of previous feed) in the erythromycin group compared with the placebo group [mean (SD) of 1.1 (1.9) vs. 3.6 (2.4), p = 0.0007]. Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) reported that feeding tolerance [defined by the median net enteral balance (nasogastric feed volume minus nasogastric feed residual volume)], was not different between the erythromycin and control group at any day during the 14 days study period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Oei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oei 2001</LINK> reported no difference in the number of vomiting episodes between the erythromycin and placebo group [mean (SD) of 4.7 (6.4) vs. 3.9 (5.8) episodes, p = 0.66] and Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) did not find any difference in the number of infants who vomited [12 (34%) vs. 10 (24%) episodes, p = 0.59] between the erythromycin and placebo group during the study period.</P>
<P>Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) reported no statistically significant difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in the number of glycerin suppositories used [15 (43%) vs. 24 (58%), p = 0.17].</P>
<P>Stenson (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>) reported no difference in mortality rate between the erythromycin and placebo group [7 (20%) vs. 8 (20%), p = 0.92].</P>

<BR/>1. Patient demographics</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 2002</LINK>: Thirty-two infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group and 28 in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Infants in the erythromycin and placebo group entered the study at similar mean postmenstrual age of 29.4 (SD 1.7) vs. 29.1 (SD 1.9) weeks. Infants in the two groups did not differ in the number of days feeds were attempted before entering the study [8.1 (SD 4.7) vs. 8.6 (SD 6.6) days]. Eighty-five percent of all study infants were fed with breast milk.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>: Fifteen infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group and 12 in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Infants in the erythromycin and placebo groups were started on enteral feedings at a similar mean age [8 (SD 12) vs. 5 (SD 4) days, p &gt; 0.05], and the mean age at study entry [24 (SD 13) vs. 26 (SD 13) days, p &gt; 0.05) ] and mean feeding volume at study entry [36 (SD 39) vs. 28 (SD 21) ml/kg/day, p &gt; 0.05] were also similar.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>: Sixty infants meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Eleven infants (five in erythromycin group and 6 in placebo group) died before reaching full feeds. Among those who completed the study, 25 (13 infants &#8804; 32 weeks and 12 infants &gt; 32 weeks) were given erythromycin and 24 (12 infants &#8804; 32 weeks and 12 infants &gt; 32 weeks) placebo. Infants in the erythromycin and placebo group did not differ in baseline characteristics. Median age at enrollment between the erythromycin and the placebo group was similar [2 (IQR 2 to 24) vs. 2 (IQR 2 to 10) days, p = NS].</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>: Twenty-seven infants were enrolled into the erythromycin group, and 29 in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Infants in the erythromycin group and placebo group were started on enteral feeding at a similar median age [median (IQR) of 6 (4 to 11) vs. 8 (5 to 11) days, p = NS) ]. The volume of feeds at the time of study entry was also similar [median (IQR) of 43 (17 to 58) vs. 51 (39 to 68) ml/kg/day, p = NS]. The percentage of infants on breast milk, formula, or a combination of both were also similar [breast milk 19 vs. 10%, p = NS; formula 30 vs. 28%, p = NS; mixed 51 vs. 62%, p = NS].</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>: Thirteen infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group and 11 in the placebo group. Infants in the two groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. However, a statistically insignificant difference was noted in the mean BW of infants in the erythromycin group compared to the placebo group [mean (SD) of 806 (216) vs. 981 (285) g, p = 0.18], which might be attributed to the trend toward larger number of small-for-gestational age infants in the erythromycin group [4/13 (31%) vs. 1/11 (9%), p = 0.22]. Infants in the erythromycin group and those in the placebo group were similar in age at initiation of feeds [mean (SD) of 5.5 (3.6) vs. 6.3 (3.7) days, p = 0.90], age at study entry [mean (SD) of 19.7 (9.0) vs. 17.3 (5.3) days, p = 0.77], gestational age at study entry [mean (SD) of 29.9 (1.4) vs. 30.0 (2.6) weeks, p = 0.88], and volume of feeds at study entry [median (SEM) of 19.6 (4.1) vs. 19.6 (2.8) ml/kg/day, p = 0.42].</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>: Twenty-nine infants were enrolled in the erythromycin group, and 28 in the control group.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>: Forty-six infants meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled. That included 42 infants &lt; 32 weeks and four infants &#8805; 32 weeks. Twenty-three infants each were allocated to the erythromycin and the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Infants in the erythromycin and placebo groups were enrolled at a similar age [median (IQR) of 7 (6 - 8) days vs. 6 (6-8) days, p = 0.41]. The volume of feeds at study entry, although not statistically significant, was higher in the erythromycin group compared to the placebo group [median (IQR) of 25 (9 to 40) vs. 15 (7 to 31) ml/kg/d, p = 0.17]. A similar, statistically insignificant trend was seen in the percentage of infants fed breast milk, where the percentage was higher in the erythromycin group compared to the placebo group (39% vs. 17%, p = 0.19). However, the type of feeds was deemed an insignificant independent variable by a Cox regression analysis model.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Time to establish full enteral feeds</B>
<BR/>The three studies that used low dose erythromycin (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) failed to show any significant difference between erythromycin and placebo in the times to establish full feeds in preterm infants &lt;32 weeks' gestation with feeding intolerance. In the study by Cairns (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 2002</LINK>), no significant difference in times to full enteral feeds between the erythromycin and the placebo group was found [mean (SD) of 13.6 (10.1) vs. 16.4 (7.1) days, mean difference adjusted for strata was -2.7 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.5 to 2.2, p = 0.27]. The study by ElHennawy (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>) found no significant difference in the number of days to reach full enteral feeds [mean (SD) of 31 (15) vs. 36 (16) days, p &gt; 0.05] and full oral feeds [mean (SD) of 54 (27) vs. 57 (25) days, p &gt; 0.05 ] between the erythromycin and the placebo group. In the study by Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>), erythromycin use was not associated with an earlier achievement of full feeds in infants born &#8804; 32 weeks' gestation [mean (SD) 18.7 (8.1) vs. 20.7 (6.1) days, p=0.5]. While the first two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>) included only preterm infants &lt; 32 weeks' gestation, the study by Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) is the only study that included infants &gt; 32 weeks' gestation, and, in a subgroup analysis, found that erythromycin was associated with a significantly earlier achievement of full enteral feeds compared to placebo [mean (SD) of 10.5 (4.1) vs. 16.3 (5.7) days, p = 0.01] in that gestational age group.</P>
<P>For studies using high dose erythromycin (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>), the treatment effect of erythromycin compared to placebo on time taken to establish full feeds in preterm infants was not consistently demonstrated. In the study by Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>), infants in the erythromycin group took a significantly shorter time to achieve 50% of enteral feeds [median (IQR) of 3.5 (2 to 7) vs. 6 (4 to 11.5) days, p &lt; 0.05], 75% of enteral feeds [median(IQR) of 8.5 (6 to 19) vs. 13 (9 to 22) days, p &lt; 0.05 ] and full enteral feeds [median (IQR) of 13.5 (8 to 22) vs. 25 (16 to 33) days, p &lt; 0.0001] than those in the placebo group. The study by Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) found similar results, with infants in the erythromycin group taking a significantly shorter time to achieve full feeds than those in the placebo group [median (IQR) 7 (6 to 9) days vs. 13 (9 to 15) days, p &lt; 0.001]. However, the study by Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>) found no statistically significant effect of erythromycin in the number of days to achieve full enteral feeds (130 ml/kg/d) compared with placebo [mean (SEM) of 24.9 (2.9) vs. 30.8 (4.1) days, p = 0.17]. The age at full feeds were not different between groups as well [mean (SD) of 46.6 (18) vs. 52.1 (17.5) days, p = 0.37]. The study by Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>), the only study among the four with subgroup analyses for infants &lt; and &#8805; 32 weeks' gestation, found that erythromycin was associated with a significantly earlier achievement of full enteral feeds compared to placebo only in those born &#8805; 32 weeks' gestation [mean (SD) of 9.2 (1.5) vs. 13.5 (6.3) days, p = 0.03]. The studies by Ng PC, Ng SC, and Nuntnatumit (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) included preterm infants with a wide range of gestational age, although the majority of subjects in these studies were &lt; 32 weeks' gestation at birth. Contrary to these three studies, Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>) found that erythromycin was not associated with an earlier achievement of full feeds in preterm infants &lt; 32 weeks groups [mean (SD) of 18.3 (11.4) vs. 17.6 (6.9) days, p = 0.84].</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the primary outcome was not appropriate because all seven studies defined feeding intolerance differently; therefore, the patients chosen for each study were inherently different and the primary outcome measure cannot be combined for analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Duration of TPN</B>
</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported on this outcome. Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) used low dose erythromycin and found that erythromycin was associated with a shorter duration of TPN but only in infants &gt; 32 weeks' gestation [mean (SD) of 5.5 (3.3) vs. 9.4 (4.8) days in those &gt; 32 weeks, p = 0.03 and 12.6 (6.3) vs. 12.6 (5.4) days in those &#8804; 32 weeks, p = 0.9]. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) that used high dose erythromycin and studied infants mostly &lt; 32 weeks found no difference in this outcome between groups [mean (SD) of 39.4 (13.8) vs. 43.3 (18.3) days (p=0.74) in Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>); and median (IQR) of 13 (11 to 15) vs. 17 (13 to 25) days (p = 0.03) in Nuntnatumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>)].</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this secondary outcome was not performed because the three studies defined feeding intolerance differently, so comparing the duration of TPN in the three studies or combining such data for meta-analysis was not appropriate.</P>
<P>
<B>4. TPN-related cholestasis</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported on cholestatic jaundice as an outcome. However, only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>) was cholestatic jaundice defined (as conjugated bilirubin level &gt;34 mmol/L). None of the studies noted any significant difference in the incidence of cholestatic jaundice between the erythromycin and the placebo group [2 (6.7%) vs. 4 (13.3%) (p=NS) in Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>); 5 (19%) vs. 10 (35%) with conjugated bilirubin &gt; 34 mmol/L (p = NS) in Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>); 4 (31%) vs. 7 (64%) (p = 0.113) in Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>); 3 (13%) vs. 2 (9%) (p = 1.00) in Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>)].</P>
<P>The lack of information in how TPN cholestasis was defined made it inappropriate to combine this outcome for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Weight gain</B>
</P>
<P>The four studies that reported on weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) showed no significant difference between infants in the erythromycin group versus those in the placebo group. Using low dose erythromycin, the study by ElHennawy (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>) showed no significant difference in weight at study day eight between the erythromycin and placebo group [mean (SD) of 1625 (430) vs. 1611 (476) grams, p &gt; 0.05]; similarly, in the study by Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>), the erythromycin and placebo groups did not differ in weight gain since enrollment for study infants in either gestational age strata (&#8804; 32 or &gt; 32 weeks). Using high dose erythromycin, Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>) showed no difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in age when birth weight was regained [mean (SD) of 12.8 (4.4) vs. 16.8 (6.2), p = 0.11]; similarly, the study by Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) showed no difference between groups in days to regain birth weight [median (IQR) of 11 (10 to 14) vs. 12 (11 to 15) days, p = 0.49] and in the weight at discharge [median (IQR) of 2170 (1987 to 2587) vs. 2560 (2130 to 3600) grams, p = 0.06].</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this outcome was not possible because weight gain was measured differently in the four studies. In addition, patients in the four studies were different because feeding intolerance was defined differently in these studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>6. Adverse effects associated with the use of erythromycin</B>
<BR/>The six studies (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) that reported on adverse effects related to the use of erythromycin found no difference in incidence between the erythromycin and placebo groups. The study by Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>) specifically reported no difference between erythromycin and placebo group in the QT interval during treatment [median (IQR) of 0.36 (0.35 to 0.4) vs. 0.38 (0.35 to 038) ms, p = NS]. No case of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis was reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>In terms of septicemia, four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported on this outcome and found no significant difference between erythromycin and placebo group in incidence of sepsis 11 (36.7%) vs.15 (50%) of study infants (p = NS) in Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>); 11 vs. 9 episodes of bacterial and fungal septicemia in Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>); 5 (17%) vs. 7(25%) infants (p = NS) in Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>); 3 (13%) vs. 4 (17%) of study infants (p = 1.00) in Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>)]. Meta-analysis of this outcome from the four trials showed no difference in the incidence of septicemia (typical risk ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.45; typical risk difference -0.04; 95% confidence interval -0.17 to 0.08)</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>7. NEC</B>
</P>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported on the incidence of NEC, but only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) clearly defined NEC (as &gt; Bell stage I). None of the five studies reported a significant difference in the incidence of NEC between the erythromycin and placebo group 3 (10%) vs. 4 (13.3%) (p = NS) in Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>); 2 (7%) vs. 3 (11%), (p = NS) in Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>); 1 (4%) vs. 4 (13%), (p = 0.61) in Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>)]. The study by Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>) reported no NEC events and Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>) reported one infant in the placebo group who developed NEC one month after full feeds were attained.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this outcome was not appropriate. The inclusion criteria of feeding intolerance was defined differently in all five studies, thus the risk of developing NEC in these patients might also be different.</P>
<P>
<B>8. Duration of hospitalization</B>

<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported on this outcome. Four of the five studies [all except Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>)] failed to show any significant difference in length of hospital stay between the erythromycin and placebo group 33.2 (14) vs. 29.2 (13.8) days, p = 0.48 for GA &#8804; 32 weeks strata; 18.3 (13.9) vs. 27.8 (10.4) days, p = 0.07 for GA &gt; 32 weeks strata in Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>); median (IQR) of 73 (64 to 97) vs. 86 (64 to 109) days (p = NS) in Ng PC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>); mean (SD) of 98.3 (35.9) vs. 99.6 (58.6) days (p = 0.68) in Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>); median (IQR) of 46 (24 to 74) vs. 60 (43 to 89) days (p=0.07) in Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>). In the study by Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>), sub-group analysis of the two gestational age strata showed that infants &#8805; 32 weeks' gestation who received erythromycin were discharged at a significantly earlier age [mean (SD) of 12.9 (3.2) vs. 22.3 (8.9) days, p = 0.003]. However, for infants &lt; 32 weeks' gestation, those who received erythromycin and those in the control group were discharged at a similar age [mean (SD) of 28.3 (10.8) vs. 26.4 (11.1) days, p = 0.64].<BR/>
</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of this outcome was not appropriate because the inclusion criteria of feeding intolerance was defined differently in all five studies, so the factors contributing to the hospital length of stay might also be different.</P>
<P>
<B>9. Other outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Gastric residuals or feeds held</P>
<P>Three studies reported gastric residuals as a secondary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>). Using low dose erythromycin, ElHennawy (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>) reported no significant difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in number of gastric residuals over 1 ml 2 ½ hrs post-feed [mean (SD) of 16 (8) vs. 21 (11) episodes, p &gt; 0.05], and the number of hours where feeding was held [mean (SD) of 42 (44) vs. 37 (38) hours, p &gt; 0.05 ]. However, using a similar dose of erythromycin, Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) found fewer episodes of significant gastric residuals (&gt; 30% of previous 6 hour feed volume) in those treated with erythromycin but only in those born &gt; 32 weeks [median (IQR) of 0 (0 to6) vs. 2 (0 to 8) episodes, p = 0.03] and not in those &#8804; 32 weeks [median (IQR) of 2 (0 to 6) vs. 2.5 (0 to 8) episodes, p = 0.77]. Using high dose erythromycin, Nuntnarumit (<LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) reported a composite outcome of the number of feeds held/significant gastric residuals (&gt;50% of feed) and found a significantly smaller number in the erythromycin group compared with the placebo group [median (IQR) 1 (0 to 2) vs. 9 (2 to 13), p &lt; 0.001].</P>
<P>Physiologic outcomes</P>
<P>The study by ElHennaway (<LINK REF="STD-ElHennawy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ElHennawy 2003</LINK>) reported gastrointestinal physiologic outcomes. Using low dose erythromycin, the study showed no significant difference between the erythromycin and placebo group in rate of gastric emptying [mean (SD) of 47 (23) vs. 32 (20)% of a feed, 20 minutes after feeding, p = NS; 71 (20) vs. 64 (26)% of a feed, one hr after feeding, p = NS ], and whole gut transit time [mean (SD) of 83 (48) vs. 78 (77) p = NS. Antroduodenal motor contractions showed similar characteristics in both groups. Although the number of antral motor contractions was higher in the erythromycin group [numbers not shown, p &lt; 0.02], they were similar after drug administration and after feeding [numbers not shown, p = NS]. Within the erythromycin group, the number of antral contractions varied significantly (ANOVA for repeated measures F = 10.0; p &lt; 0.001).<BR/>
<BR/>The study by Ng SC (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>) evaluated the effects of high dose erythromycin on gastroesophageal reflux and showed no difference in the reflux indices before and after the study between the erythromycin and placebo groups [mean (SD) of 7.3 (15.5) vs. 13.6 (17.3)% before, p = 0.72 and 4.3 (7.1) vs. 0.3 (0.6)% after, p = 0.07]; the percentage of infants with a reduction in reflux in each group as a result of the study drug also did not differ significantly [23% vs. 36%, p = 0.57].</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-09 12:37:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review summarizes the use of erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in preterm infants with or at risk of feeding intolerance at both high and low doses. Among included studies, however, there exist great heterogeneity in study design and methodology, particularly in terms of the study population chosen, dose and duration of erythromycin used, the primary and secondary outcomes measured, the definition of outcomes measured, and in the method with which data were analyzed and reported. An example was the vast differences in definition of feeding intolerance in all of the treatment studies; without such uniform criteria for inclusion, the patient population studied was incomparable, rendering it impossible (and inappropriate) to combine outcomes amongst these studies for meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Based on the currently available information, it is difficult to draw any clear conclusion on the effectiveness of erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in preterm infants. Nevertheless, a few observations were made, which may provide some insights into how future research directions in this area should be focused. </P>
<P>Neither the prevention nor the treatment strategy as outlined in this review has demonstrated a consistent effect of erythromycin in the primary outcome of time required to achieve full feeds. It is unclear from this review whether erythromycin works better if used prophylactically or in those who had established feeding intolerance.</P>
<P>There was significant variability in the dosage of erythromycin used in all the included studies. This review has attempted to further categorize the studies by the dose range of erythromycin used (low dose 3 to 12 mg/kg/day or high dose &gt;12 mg/kg/day). Although neither dose range has consistently been shown to be efficacious, studies using higher doses of erythromycin seem to have reported more success in preterm infants with feeding intolerance. Three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-PC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng PC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuntnarumit-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nuntnarumit 2006</LINK>) using erythromycin at doses between 40 to 50 mg/kg/day reported a statistically significant effect on feeding tolerance, and one study using erythromycin at a slightly smaller dose (but still considered high dose) of 15 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-SC-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng SC 2003</LINK>) showed a trend toward improved feeding tolerance. Similar effect of erythromycin at higher doses has previously been observed in uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kubota-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubota 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 1998</LINK>), where preterm infants with feeding intolerance were able to achieve full enteral feeds within one to two weeks of erythromycin treatment. These findings seem contradictory to animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zara-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zara 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otterson 1990</LINK>) and human adult studies (<LINK REF="REF-Annese-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annese 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tack-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tack 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulie 1998</LINK>) where erythromycin's prokinetic effects were demonstrated primarily at low doses. However, one must consider that the clinical effect of a given dose of erythromycin is dependent on highly complex pharmacokinetic and metabolic functions and the presence of multiple confounders in preterm infants.</P>
<P>Another observation in this review regarded the relationship between the gestational age at birth and the response to the prokinetic effect of erythromycin. Among all the included studies in this review, only two (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>) had separate analyses of outcome data for gestational age subgroups. The study by Aly (<LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>) showed that, compared to placebo, erythromycin was effective in achieving full enteral feeds earlier, with fewer episodes of significant gastric residuals, and less days on TPN, but only in the subgroup of infants &gt; 32 weeks' gestation. Similarly, Madani (<LINK REF="STD-Madani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2004</LINK>) found that erythromycin was effective in earlier achievement of full enteral feeds and a shorter length of hospital stay, but only in those &#8805; 32 weeks&#8217; gestation. This finding supports the previous observation that the propagative phase III of the MMC is not well developed until 32 weeks' GA (<LINK REF="REF-al-Tawil-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">al Tawil 1996</LINK>). As the prokinetic effect of erythromycin is based on stimulation of the propagative phase III of the MMC (<LINK REF="REF-Peeters-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 1989</LINK>), it is not surprising that erythromycin was found to be more effective in treating preterm infants &gt; 32 weeks' GA with feeding intolerance.</P>
<P>In conclusion, at present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin at any dose for the prevention and treatment of feeding intolerance, especially for preterm infants less than 32 weeks' GA. Future research effort should be directed towards identifying a more precise dose range where erythromycin may be effective as prokinetic agent in preterm infants. Based on the limited number of studies included in this review, a dose larger than what was defined <I>a priori</I> (3 to 12mg/kg/day) as a prokinetic dose for preterm infants at least 32 weeks' GA may need to be closely examined; longer term follow-up of study patients will also be required to establish the safety of erythromycin used in this setting.</P>

<P>The initial inclusion criteria from the protocol were to only include studies where low dose erythromycin (3 to 12 mg/kg/day) was used for treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants. However, literature search has since identified a significant number of studies using erythromycin at doses higher than 12 mg/kg/day, and other studies used erythromycin as prophylaxis for preterm infants at risk of feeding intolerance. A <I>post hoc</I> decision was made to include these studies in the updated review. Studies of erythromycin use for prevention of feeding intolerance (prevention studies) and those for treatment of feeding intolerance (treatment studies) were separately considered according to the criteria listed below. Where possible, subgroup analyses were performed for data from studies using erythromycin at low and high doses.</P>
