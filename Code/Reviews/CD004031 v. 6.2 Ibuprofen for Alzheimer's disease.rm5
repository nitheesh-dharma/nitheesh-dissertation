<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:41:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There is increasing interest in non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extensive epidemiological surveys have suggested a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients receiving long term treatment with NSAIDs. Animal and cell culture studies have produced evidence that inflammatory processes may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. As a result, agents such as ibuprofen have been proposed for the treatment of people with AD. Although ibuprofen is better tolerated overall than some other NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of this drug for treatment of people with AD have been published. One such a trial is underway. The use of ibuprofen for the treatment of AD cannot at present be recommended.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may have a role in the treatment of conditions characterized by inflammatory processes. Ibuprofen may attenuate the effects of modulators of inflammation that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:40:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 10 December 2002 using the (many) terms listed in the main text of the review. The CDCIG Register is updated regularly and contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases.</P>
<P>In addition computerized databases and Internet sites pertaining to ibuprofen and Alzheimer's disease were systematically examined by two reviewers independently. Data on ongoing trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of people with AD were also sought.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Eligibility for this review included all single or multi centre placebo-controlled randomized trials examining the efficacy of ibuprofen in the treatment of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease according to internationally accepted criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified to ensure lack of bias in selection and methodological quality of selected trials. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The aim was for the two reviewers NT and HF to collect data independently. The data selected would reflect cognitive, behavioural, physical and psychological domains of AD. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:40:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>A systematic search of all available databases and other sources failed to identify any completed randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials, assessing the efficacy of ibuprofen in AD eligible for inclusion in the review. One double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigating ibuprofen treatment for age-associated memory impairment has been identified, but is yet unfinished and no data are yet available. Other trials assessing the effect of ibuprofen on CSF beta amyloid in cognitively unimpaired individuals and the effect of other NSAIDs such as naproxen and rofecoxib for people with AD are currently underway.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No evidence yet exists from randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trials on whether ibuprofen is efficacious for patients diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease. Ibuprofen, like other NSAIDs, has an identifiable and in some instances a significant side-effect profile which may include gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, it needs to be shown that the benefits of such a treatment outweighs the risk of side effects before ibuprofen can be recommended for people with Alzheimer's disease. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:41:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The dementias include some of the most devastating chronic illnesses known and as yet there is no known cure for any of the irreversible conditions. Dementia is a clinical syndrome independent of the prognosis (APA) with a minority of cases with reversible causes (<LINK REF="REF-Walstra-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walstra 1997</LINK>). Advances have been made in understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cognitive impairment and associated manifestations. As a result, new treatment options are being evaluated for ameliorating the clinical features of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. There remains a need for research and evaluation of agents that may prevent or slow the progression of these conditions.</P>
<P>Inflammatory processes may play a part in the pathogenesis of dementing disorders whatever their aetiology. The activation of microglia, astrocytes and complement products contribute to the generation of inflammatory substances (<LINK REF="REF-Kalaria-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalaria 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eikelenboom--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelenboom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Floyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floyd 1999</LINK>). The resultant inflammatory environment can be amplified through a series of interactions involving various mediators of toxicity. Free radicals, cytokines and other neuroinflammatory substances, in turn, may "reciprocally induce" each other and enhance neurotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Tabet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabet 2000</LINK>). Prostaglandins can also increase toxicity and induce cytokine synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 2000</LINK>) so potentiating chronic inflammation.</P>
<P>Attenuation of some of these inflammatory processes can be achieved through inhibition of the activity of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase which is critical to the production of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Fiebich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiebich 1997</LINK>). This inhibition can be achieved through the use of various NSAIDs which might thereby attenuate the inflammatory response in degenerative dementias. The possibility of benefit from NSAIDS in the treatment of dementia has been supported by several lines of evidence. Epidemiological studies have found a lower prevalence of dementia in people who have regularly taken NSAIDs, usually for rheumatological problems (<LINK REF="REF-McGeer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGeer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1997</LINK>). There has also been a cohort study reporting a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease AD in users of NSAIDs than in non-users (<LINK REF="REF-in-t_x0027_-Veld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">in t' Veld 2001</LINK>). There is in vitro evidence that, independently of their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, some NSAIDs can directly influence the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Avramovich-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avramovich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blasko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blasko 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently we have assessed the evidence for the efficacy of indomethacin, one of the earliest NSAIDs, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Tabet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabet 2002</LINK>). The clinical use of indomethacin at appropriate doses is limited by its serious adverse effects especially for older people.</P>
<P>Ibuprofen is a safer and more widely used NSAID, belonging, like naproxen and ketoprofen to the group of propionic acid derivatives and reduces prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase. Ibuprofen was discovered in 1969, and since 1984 has been available over-the-counter in the UK. The peak plasma level of ibuprofen occurs 1-2 hours after ingestion and its plasma half-life is 2 hours. The usual dose is 200-600 mg three times a day and the drug is eliminated predominantly through the kidneys although a decrease in hepatic function, which is more likely in the elderly, may also impair the drug metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK>). The liver is also involved in the enantiomeric steroconversion of the molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Hamman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamman 1997</LINK>). In a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, ibuprofen reduced the number and total area of beta-amyloid deposits, and interleukin-1beta and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2000</LINK>). However, compared with chronic ibuprofen treatment, acute treatment leads to only mild reductions in interleukin-1beta and insoluble beta-amyloid (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2001</LINK>). In human neuronal cells, ibuprofen decreased the secretion of total Abeta from cytokine-stimulated cells by 50% and prevented the accumulation of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 (<LINK REF="REF-Blasko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blasko 2001</LINK>). This was further supported by <LINK REF="REF-Weggen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weggen 2001</LINK> who also showed that NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, decreased Abeta1-42 peptide produced by cultured cells by as much as 80%. The levels of Abeta1-42 were also lowered in mice producing mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein following short-term administration of ibuprofen. As well as reducing Abeta, ibuprofen reduced interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide generation and inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression in a murine macrophage cell line (<LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 2000</LINK>). In rats, ibuprofen induced a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and superoxide production that might reduce oxidative damage to neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Lambat-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambat 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ibuprofen effects were not limited to Abeta and possible implications for Alzheimer's disease. In humans, ibuprofen inhibited adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, decreased free radical production, increased levels of HDL cholesterol and inhibited production of plasminogen activator inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Zapolska_x002d_Downar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zapolska-Downar 2001</LINK>). The authors suggested a role for ibuprofen in the management of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, in cultured rat embryonic neurons ibuprofen protected dopaminergic neurons against glutamate toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Casper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casper 2000</LINK>). Ibuprofen may therefore have a beneficial role against Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>SELECTION OF STUDIES<BR/>Two reviewers (NT, HF) select and assess all references independently. Each reference is considered against inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>The quality of the methods used in each assessed study will be assessed with regard to randomization, blinding, patient selection, placebo, reporting of results and statistical analysis.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data are collected from each considered study using a standard form. For the intention-to-treat analysis data are sought for each outcome measure on every patient randomized, irrespective of compliance. For the analyses of completers, data are sought on every patient completing the study on placebo or treatment. </P>
<P>For continuous variables, or ordinal variables that could be approximated to continuous variables, the main outcome of interest will be the final assessment and the change from baseline at final assessment. For some ordinal and binary outcomes, the endpoint category relative to baseline category is the outcome of interest. For others, such as the global impression of change, the endpoint itself is of clinical relevance as all patients would be by definition at the same baseline score. The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomisation, but no longer than 2 months before.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>If selected studies reported the same outcome measures, the method of weighted mean difference is used. In the more likely event that different scales have been used, the method of standardized mean difference is used. For ordinal scale data appearing to be approximately normally distributed, the outcome measures can be treated as continuous variables. For data that are not normally distributed, two categories can be used to represent the contrasting states of interest, and the outcome measure then is treated as binary. For binary outcomes, the endpoint itself is of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio is used. Chi-square statistics are used to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between selected trials.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No results from a randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of ibuprofen for people with AD have been published. A systematic search of all available databases and other sources failed to produce any completed and published trial. Nor have any case reports been found. However, one double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigating ibuprofen treatment for age-associated memory impairment has been identified, but is yet unfinished and no data are yet available. This particular trial (Small 1999) has been designed to test whether ibuprofen treatment delays cognitive symptoms in people with age-associated mental decline who are at risk for developing AD. The hypothesis is that individuals taking ibuprofen will show slower rate of mental decline than those who have been receiving a placebo. The researchers postulate that cognitive decline and the response to treatment will be influenced by genetic factors, age, sex, prior educational levels and memory capability. Subjects aged between 65 and 90 and with age-associated memory impairment who are at risk for further cognitive decline have been randomized between placebo and treatment groups. The treatment comprises administration of ibuprofen 1200 mg daily. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors has been specified as an exclusion criterion. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the ongoing study will be assessed once it has been published and a determination will be made then as to whether it meets the inclusion criteria we have set.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>This section will await the publication of trials meeting the inclusion criteria we have set.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>To date no data from randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials have been published. As a result, ibuprofen cannot be recommended for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although ibuprofen is associated with a lower frequency of serious side effects than other NSAIDs, its use can only be considered in AD patients when evidence demonstrates clinical benefits. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Various cell culture and animal studies have shown ibuprofen to have neuroprotective effects. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are now needed to show whether the use of ibuprofen is justified for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. </P>
