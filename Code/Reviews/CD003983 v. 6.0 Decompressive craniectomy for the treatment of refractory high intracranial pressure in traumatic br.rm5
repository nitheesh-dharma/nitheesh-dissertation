<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-12 11:44:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An injury to the brain may cause it to swell. Pressure within the skull then increases as the brain has no room to expand; this excess pressure, known as intracranial pressure, can cause further brain injury. High intracranial pressure (ICP) is the most frequent cause of death and disability in brain-injured patients. If high ICP cannot be controlled using general or first-line therapeutic measures such as adjusting body temperature or carbon dioxide levels in the blood and sedation, second-line treatments are initiated. One of these is a procedure called decompressive craniectomy (DC). DC involves the removal of a section of skull so that the brain has room to expand and the pressure decrease. There is however clinical uncertainty regarding the use of DC and a lack of consensus on the optimal management of traumatic brain injury.</P>
<P>This review looked at all high quality trials investigating the effectiveness of DC, compared to conventional medical treatments, on survival and neurological outcomes for patients over the age of 12 months who had a raised ICP after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Only one trial was identified. This trial involved 27 pediatric patients (less than 18 years old). The results indicate that the risk of death and disability was moderately reduced when DC was used. No trials investigating the effectiveness in adults were found.</P>
<P>The authors of the review conclude that there is no evidence to support the routine use of DC to improve mortality and quality of life in brain-injured adults with high ICP. DC may improve survival and neurological outcomes in brain-injured pediatric patients with raised ICP for whom other medical treatments had failed. This one trial involved only a small number of patients and further studies are needed before applying DC as a routine treatment.</P>
<P>Two trials of DC are currently in progress, the results from which may allow further conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the procedure in adults. These will be incorporated into the review when they are completed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-12 02:25:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High intracranial pressure (ICP) is the most frequent cause of death and disability after a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). High ICP is usually treated with general maneuvers (normothermia, sedation, etc.) and a set of first-line therapeutic measures (moderate hypocapnia, mannitol, etc.). When these measures fail to control high ICP, second-line therapies are initiated. Of these, barbiturates, hyperventilation, moderate hypothermia, or removal of a variable amount of skull bone (decompressive craniectomy) are used.</P>

<P>We found only one trial with 27 participants, conducted in a pediatric population.

<P>There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials that supports the routine use of secondary decompressive craniectomy to reduce unfavorable outcomes in adults with severe TBI and refractory high ICP. In the study with a pediatric population, decompressive craniectomy reduced the risk of death and unfavorable outcomes. Despite the wide CI for death and the small sample size of this one identified study, the treatment may be justified in patients below the age of 18 years when maximal medical treatment has failed to control ICP. There are two ongoing randomized controlled trials of decompressive craniectomy (RescueICP and DECRA) that will allow further conclusions on the efficacy of this procedure in adults.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-12 15:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-12 15:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard definition of traumatic brain injury (TBI), or craniocerebral trauma, is &#8220;the occurrence of injury to the head that is associated with symptoms or signs attributable to the injury such as decreased level of consciousness, amnesia, other neurological or neuropsychological abnormalities, skull fracture, intracranial lesions or death&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Thurman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurman 1999</LINK>). TBI is a major health problem in all countries and, because of the long-term disabilities sustained by survivors, it poses a continual challenge to health systems. It is a burden on families and the community in terms of monetary cost, suffering, and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Fearnside-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fearnside 1997</LINK>). In the USA, 2% of the population (5.3 million citizens) are living with disability as a result of TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Thurman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Elevated intracranial pressure in severe TBI</HEADING>
<P>High intracranial pressure (ICP) is still the most frequent cause of death and disability after severe head injury. Elevated ICP is usually defined as an ICP above 15 to 20 mm Hg when measured within any intracranial space (the subdural, intraventricular, extradural, or intraparenchymal compartments). Mortality and morbidity after severe TBI have been strongly related to raised ICP (<LINK REF="REF-Marmarou-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmarou 1991</LINK>). The cause of high ICP is an increase in brain volume at the expense of one or more intracranial components. Mass lesions and an increase in brain water content (edema) and cerebral blood volume contribute to raised ICP in TBI.</P>
<P>The Glasgow Coma Scale, introduced by Teasdale and Jennett in 1974, is the most widely used system for grading head injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Teasdale-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasdale 1974</LINK>). This scale has been incorporated into numerous trauma classification systems, despite its known limitations (that is its failure to incorporate brainstem reflexes, its reported skew toward the motor response) (<LINK REF="REF-Sternbach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sternbach 2000</LINK>). In this scale, the definition of severe TBI includes patients with a non-surgical post-resuscitation score below or equal to eight, or those with a score that deteriorates to eight or less (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1991</LINK>). Nearly 10% of all TBI patients admitted to hospital have a severe head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Kraus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraus 1996</LINK>). Recent studies have shown that the number of patients with an unfavorable outcome after severe head injury is still very high, even in highly specialised neurotrauma centers that participate in phase II or III randomized clinical trials in the USA and Europe. The IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trial) database has recently been published and contains the complete data set from most clinical trials conducted over the past 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Marmarou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmarou 2007</LINK>). Analysis of this huge amount of data, from 9205 patients with moderate to severe brain injuries, shows that although mortality as a result of severe TBI has significantly dropped in the last decade at least 50% of patients with severe TBI still die or have a non-functional outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Marmarou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmarou 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite a better understanding of the neurochemical cascades triggered by mechanical trauma, as well as technical advances in neuromonitoring, the outcomes for patients with severe TBI have reached what seems to be an unmodifiable plateau. Clinical trials with drugs that were promising in laboratory studies have yielded disappointing results when tested in multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trials. This suggests that in head-injured patients, neuroprotection cannot be achieved as simply as in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Maas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1999</LINK>). This failure may reflect the inability of experimental models to accurately reproduce human head injury, inappropriate selection of the target population of head-injured patients, or insufficient knowledge of the optimal therapeutic window for each drug. Further reasons could be the lack of penetration of the neuroprotective drugs to the required site in the brain or insensitivity of the outcome scales currently available to discriminate the potential benefits of new treatments. A third hypothesis is that severe primary brain damage may be present in some of the patients and that such damage cannot be modified by any available treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Sahuquillo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahuquillo 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Elevated intracranial pressure in severe TBI</HEADING>
<P>High intracranial pressure (ICP) frequently causes death and disability after severe head injury. Elevated ICP is usually defined as an ICP above 20 mm Hg, measured in any intracranial compartment (subdural, intraventricular, extradural, or intraparenchymal). Mortality and morbidity after severe TBI have been strongly related to raised ICP (<LINK REF="REF-Marmarou-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmarou 1991</LINK>). Juul et al, in a post-hoc analysis of the data from the international multi-center trial of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist Selfotel, showed that the most powerful predictor of neurological worsening was the presence of an ICP &#8805; 20 mm Hg either initially or during neurological deterioration (<LINK REF="REF-Juul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul 2000</LINK>). In these patients, the cause of high ICP may have been an increase in brain volume at the expense of one or more intracranial components. An increase in brain water content (edema), a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, an increase in cerebral blood volume, and the occurrence of mass lesions may contribute to raised ICP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management of high ICP</HEADING>
<P>In many centers, worldwide, the treatment of high ICP is based on the recommendations from the 'Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury' that were developed by the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF). These guidelines have been periodically updated since the first version was published in 1995. The last version of the guidelines was published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Brain-Trauma-Foundation-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain Trauma Foundation 2007</LINK>). The algorithm for treating high ICP that is recommended in the BTF guidelines is based on a set of general maneuvers (head elevation, normothermia, volume resuscitation, sedation, etc.). If these general maneuvers fail, a set of 'first line' therapeutic measures are started. These include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, moderate hypocapnia (pCO<SUB>2 </SUB>of 30 to 35 mm Hg), and mannitol administration (<LINK REF="REF-Brain-Trauma-Foundation-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain Trauma Foundation 2007</LINK>). However, despite being recommended by the BTF, there is no robust evidence to show that any of these therapeutic measures are effective in improving patient outcomes.</P>
<P>When these first-level measures fail to control ICP, only a few therapeutic options (second-tier therapies) are available, unless potentially evacuable mass lesions are detected in the computed tomography (CT) scan. Suggested second-tier measures are high-dose barbiturates, intense hyperventilation (pCO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 30 mm Hg), increasing mean arterial blood pressure, mild or moderate hypothermia, and decompressive craniectomy (DC). Of these, only the use of barbiturates has reached a Level II recommendation (based on Class II evidence) to treat high ICP; other medical and surgical therapies have failed to do so (<LINK REF="REF-Brain-Trauma-Foundation-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain Trauma Foundation 2007b</LINK>). Other second-line therapies are based on Class III evidence and, therefore, considered to be Level III recommendations.</P>
<P>Despite the recommendations of the BTF guidelines on the use of barbiturates, a Cochrane systematic review did not find evidence that the use of barbiturates improves the outcome in severe TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Although barbiturates may reduce raised ICP, the reduction is not associated with lower mortality or improved outcome in survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Barbiturates lower blood pressure in one out of every four patients treated and this hypotensive effect may offset the beneficial effect in lowering ICP (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Because of this lack of effective second-level therapeutic measures, alternatives to barbiturates and in particular DC should be reconsidered in the treatment of refractory high ICP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Decompressive craniectomy in the management of severe TBI</HEADING>
<P>Although there is uncertainty about who was the first surgeon to perform decompressive craniectomy (DC), the first known written report on decompressive surgery was written by Annandale in 1894. He stated that 20 years previously he had operated on a patient with symptoms of high intracranial pressure and also reported on other patients under his care who underwent palliative DC. A comprehensive historical review of the first patients to undergo DC was published by Spiller and Frazier in 1906 (<LINK REF="REF-Spiller-1906" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiller 1906</LINK>). Although almost all pioneers of neurosurgery had performed this surgical procedure in the last part of the nineteenth century, as a palliative measure in inoperable tumors, it seems that Kocher was the first to propose DC in patients with clinical symptoms of elevated ICP (<LINK REF="REF-Kocher-1901" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kocher 1901</LINK>). Later, in 1905, Cushing made a detailed report on a subtemporal and suboccipital decompression procedure to relieve high ICP in patients with inoperable brain tumors (<LINK REF="REF-Cushing-1905" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushing 1905</LINK>).</P>
<P>Historically removal of different parts and quantities of the skull, with or without opening the meningeal covering or augmentative duraplasty, has been performed in TBI. These procedures have been used mainly to manage patients with high ICP and as a primary procedure in the evacuation of intradural lesions when the surgeon felt that the brain was tight and edematous (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1976</LINK>). These procedures allow the brain to expand and consequently facilitate the control of high ICP. Although surgical decompression has no proven effect on the primary brain injury (injuries to the brain inflicted directly by the traumatic insult), it could reduce the damage caused by secondary lesions (delayed brain damage) such as brain herniation and high ICP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of surgical decompression</HEADING>
<P>Decompressive craniectomy can be performed in two completely different situations.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Prophylactic decompression or primary decompressive craniectomy (P-DC) is defined in this review as any surgical decompression performed, with or without brain tissue removal, in patients undergoing surgery primarily for the evacuation of any type of intradural lesion. The aim of prophylactic craniectomy is not to control refractory ICP but to avoid expected postsurgical increases in ICP. In these procedures the decision taken by the surgeon is generally independent of ICP and is usually based on a CT scan or intraoperative surgical findings (brain swelling, a 'tight' brain, or difficulties in repositioning the bone flap), or both (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1976</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Therapeutic decompression or secondary decompressive craniectomy (S-DC) is defined as the procedure performed in patients in whom continuous ICP monitoring is conducted and in whom high ICP is refractory to medical treatment. This therapeutic option is used in some centers after first- or second-line therapeutic measures have failed to control ICP. In the category of S-DC we also included patients who had undergone a first surgical procedure to evacuate a space-occupying lesion and who had later developed delayed massive unilateral or bilateral brain swelling. Although previous surgery might have been performed in these patients, the purpose of surgical decompression is to control high ICP (<LINK REF="STD-Guerra-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 1999a</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical technique</HEADING>
<P>Wide variability has been reported in the surgical procedures used for performing decompressive surgery. These variations include small to massive amounts of bone removal, uni- or bilateral bone decompression, opening the duramater or leaving it closed, scarifying the duramater to decrease its rigidity, and sectioning of the falx among others. Localization of bone removal can be unilateral, bilateral, bifrontal, or subtemporal; or it can be expanded to what has been called 'circumferential decompression' (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_nch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Münch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruf-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruf 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Patients over the age of 12 months with a severe traumatic brain injury and in a coma (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score below or equal to eight points) and who underwent S-DC to control raised ICP that was refractory to medical treatment (analgesia, sedation, muscular paralysis, hyperosmolar solutions, hyperventilation, barbiturates, etc.) were included in this review. Because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage was considered as a first-level therapeutic measure in the second version of the 'Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury' (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 2000a</LINK>) this maneuver was included as a conventional medical treatment.</P>
<P>As in the first published version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Sahuquillo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahuquillo 2006</LINK>), only those studies that defined the type of lesion using a CT scan and in which ICP was monitored (regardless of the method) were included. Since age is a strong independent predictor of outcome after severe TBI, this review planned to conduct a subgroup analysis of the efficacy of DC in patients aged 18 years or less, older than 18 years but below 60 years, and above 60 years.</P>
<P>In this study the term 'high ICP' was used to define those patients who underwent ICP monitoring and who showed ICP readings above a 20 mm Hg threshold. Studies that estimated ICP from the CT scans (diffuse unilateral or bilateral brain swelling, compressed basal cisterns, etc.) or neurological worsening in the absence of ICP monitoring were excluded. Neurological worsening was defined as a reported deterioration in the Glasgow Coma Scale score and dilation of at least one pupil that became unreactive to light.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-12 05:01:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, secondary decompressive craniectomy (S-DC) was defined as bone decompression with the duramater left closed, scarified, open, or opened and augmented by duraplasty. The importance of opening the rigid and inelastic duramater in any decompressive procedure was clearly stated by Cushing, in 1905: &#8220;The mere removal of bone alone does not usually answer as a palliative measure, for, owing to the inelasticity of the dura, sufficient decompression will not ensue until this membrane has been freely incised or removed" (<LINK REF="REF-Cushing-1905" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushing 1905</LINK>). Several experimental and clinical studies of the craniospinal dynamics have emphasized this point and, therefore, studies that performed large bone decompression without opening the duramater, although included in this review, were considered as suboptimal.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of comparison</HEADING>
<P>Because this type of surgery has generally been carried out as a rescue therapy, clinical trials comparing decompressive surgery versus a control therapy are likely to be uncommon. If such studies were located, patients receiving maximal medical treatment would be considered the control group. Maximal medical treatment is defined as non-surgical therapies used to control ICP (that is hyperosmolar solutions, sedation and paralysis, hyperventilation, barbiturates, and moderate hypothermia). Cerebrospinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing ICP monitoring by ventriculostomy would also be considered as non-surgical therapy.</P>

<P>The main outcome measures for this systematic review were as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mortality at one month after injury (30 ± 10 days);</LI>
<LI>neurological outcome at six or 12 months evaluated with the dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and categorized into good or bad outcomes. Patients with a good recovery or moderate disability were included in the good outcome group while those who were severely disabled, remained in a vegetative state, or died were included in the bad outcome group.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In dealing with studies that did not define the outcome according to the GOS, every effort was made to convert reported outcomes into a form suitable for group comparisons. The one-month mortality rate was included in our protocol to avoid any problems in evaluating medium-term outcomes in clinical trials in which dropouts were frequent. If decompressive craniectomy is effective, a significant reduction in short-term mortality can be expected. However, mortality at one month is almost never reported in any of the clinical trials evaluating neurological outcome. A secondary outcome measure was the effectiveness of surgical treatment in significantly reducing ICP, which was defined as an ICP of less than 20 mm Hg after decompression. In studies reporting mean ICP a reduction of at least 10 mm Hg was considered to be significant.</P>

<P>Methods: a prospective randomized controlled trial of secondary decompressive craniectomy in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury and high ICP refractory to maximal medical treatment, including barbiturates and hypothermia. Participants: patients aged between 12 months and 18 years who underwent ICP monitoring and who had intracranial hypertension during the first day after admission (ICP 20 to 24 mm Hg for 30 min, 25 to 29 mm Hg for 10 min, 30 mm Hg or more for 1 min) or evidence of herniation (dilatation of one pupil, or bradycardia) were eligible for randomization. Method of randomization: by blocks of four for the two first patients enrolled, the Zelen method was used (<LINK REF="REF-Zelen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelen 1979</LINK>); randomization occurred at a median of 16 h (range 3 to 29 h) after injury. Methods of allocation concealment: sealed opaque envelopes.</P>
<P>Participants: 27 patients with high ICP that was refractory to medical treatment. The mean ICP, calculated from the last three pre-randomization values, was 25.6 ± 8.1 mm Hg in the control group and 26.4 ± 7.9 mm Hg in the decompression group.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Experimental: patients underwent a bi-temporal craniectomy in addition to maximal medical treatment. A 34 cm disc of temporal bone was removed by extending the opening down to the floor of the middle cranial fossa. The duramater was left intact and, in a few cases, scarified.</LI>
<LI>Controls: maximal medical therapy, including barbiturate-induced coma and moderate hypothermia in all cases. Fourteen children were randomized to medical management alone, and 13 children to decompressive craniectomy and maximal medical treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Outcomes: ICP control, modified Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months, quality of life measured by the Health State Utility Index (HSU Index) at six months. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.</P>
<P>Dropouts: There were no dropouts. One child allocated to the decompression group could not be contacted for the six-month follow up but was contacted at 11 months, when the outcome was assessed.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment: A.</P>
<P>Blinding of evaluators of outcome: the evaluators of the outcome were blinded to the allocated treatment. The outcome assessor was blinded to the treatments received while in the intensive care unit (ICU) and there was a prescribed list of questions, for consistency. All outcome assessments were done by a single evaluator.</P>
<P>Outcomes: six children died in the medical group and three in the decompressive arm.</P>
<P>Notes: the authors were contacted to obtain further details on their study. Published and unpublished data, supplied by one of the authors (Dr W Butt) at our request, were used to evaluate the study. Although randomization was performed by blocks of four, the final numbers of patients were 13 and 14 in the two groups because the study was stopped after an interim analysis. Lack of concealment is an intrinsic limitation of any decompressive trial, rather than a limitation of this particular study. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted but, because there were no dropouts or crossovers, no changes were found. The only limitation of this study was that the 27 patients were enrolled over a seven-year period (between November 1991 and December 1998).</P>
<P>Methodological quality: CONSORT scale of 12. As previously described, the CONSORT scale was adapted for the concealment issue. In studies in which the evaluator of the outcome was clearly blinded, concealment was considered adequate.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-12 07:01:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified only one randomized controlled trial examining the effect of DC on death and disability following severe head injury that led to a high ICP refractory to maximal medical treatment, in a pediatric population (&lt;18 years of age). This was a small study in which 27 participants were enrolled over a period of seven years. The quality of this study was high and the lack of allocation concealment was overcome by blinding the evaluator of the outcome. The risk of death in participants treated with DC was lower than that of patients treated with maximal medical treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.72). The risk of unfavorable outcome (death, vegetative status, or severe disability) was also lower in the DC group than in the control group (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.01).</P>
<P>We found no evidence that decompressive craniectomy reduced the risk of death or disability following head injury in adults (&#8805; 18 years). However, on the basis of the existing evidence, the possibility of significant benefit in patients with severe TBI and high ICP that is not controllable by maximal medical treatment cannot be refuted. We did find two ongoing RCTs, the RescueICP trial in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Rescue-ICP" TYPE="STUDY">Rescue ICP</LINK>) and the DECRA study in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-DECRA" TYPE="STUDY">DECRA</LINK>), that aim to address this question.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-12 12:30:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increased ICP is the most frequent cause of death and disability following severe TBI. When high ICP is not related to evacuable mass lesions, for example in patients with unilateral or bilateral diffuse brain swelling, medical treatment is frequently ineffective in controlling ICP. Despite newly developed medical treatment modalities and improved methods of neuromonitoring, the mortality and morbidity caused by brain swelling remains high. In the absence of an evacuable mass lesion, most of these patients will either die or survive in a non-functional status. No therapeutic options (barbiturates, other pharmacological options, or hypothermia) have been shown to be effective in these situations. An alternative approach when ICP is not controlled is to increase cranial volume by removing part of the skull and opening the duramater (decompressive craniectomy (DC)). In many neurotrauma centers this treatment option is currently used as a rescue therapy.</P>
<P>Decompressive surgery for refractory intracranial hypertension is directed toward improving cerebral perfusion, preventing ischemic damage, and avoiding mechanical compression of the brain (brain herniations). The rationale for decompressive surgery is based on the Monro-Kellie law. According to this theory intracranial volume should remain constant and volumetric compensations should be achieved by shifts in CSF, cerebral blood volume, or brain herniations. Removing a variable amount of bone, with or without leaving the duramater open or augmented by a duraplasty, is a fast and effective means of increasing intracranial volume; reducing elevated intracranial pressure and increasing the compliance of the intracranial space. In the Aarabi et al study, mean ICP decreased from 24 to 14.6 mm Hg after decompression (<LINK REF="STD-Aarabi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aarabi 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>DC has been used, since the beginning of neurosurgery, as a palliative treatment to relieve high intracranial pressure in patients with inoperable brain tumors, hydrocephalus, or head injuries. The rationale for DC is that by removing a variable amount of bone the skull is converted from &#8220;a closed box with a finite volume into an open one"<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1980</LINK>). In the words of Cooper et al, the benefits of DC in TBI are to facilitate the control of ICP, improve cerebral perfusion pressure, and avoid brain herniation and brainstem compression (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1980</LINK>). Experimental models in the late 1960s and early 1970s showed that decompressive surgery was highly effective in reducing mortality in unilateral brain swelling. However, Moody et al commented that although unilateral hemicraniectomy significantly improved mortality in dogs with unilateral brain swelling, &#8220;The quality of survival has not been good"<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Moody-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moody 1968</LINK>). This and other negative reports introduced an important bias against this technique, supported by the influential clinical report of Clark et al in 1968 (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1968</LINK>). These authors stated that &#8220;The reason for reporting this experience is to warn others from doing similar surgery"<I>  </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1968</LINK>). DC was almost abandoned in TBI due to early views that this surgery was ineffective and had too many complications for only a limited benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1980</LINK>). Improvements in surgical techniques, with greater possibilities of total or subtotal removal of brain tumors, and the introduction of hyperosmolar agents (urea, glycerol, and mannitol) and corticosteroids in the management of patients with high ICP reduced the need for this radical measure, which was discarded from the neurosurgical armamentarium by most neurosurgeons. Textbooks on TBI that were written in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s did not recommend this procedure.</P>
<P>In the last two decades, in addition to improvements in the pre-hospital care of patients with TBI, the use of well-designed protocols and the monitoring of ICP have clearly changed the scenario in which these patients are treated. Furthermore, both clinical and experimental studies have shown that DC significantly reduces post-traumatic intracranial hypertension and improves intracranial pressure dynamics, brain oxygenation, and brain metabolism in patients with refractory, high ICP (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivecrona-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Olivecrona 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitfield-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Whitfield 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitfield-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Whitfield 2001b</LINK>). In addition, findings from case reports, retrospective series, prospective non-randomized trials, and controlled trials with historical controls suggest that a favorable outcome might be expected in patients who are managed with targeted protocol therapies and are given timely treatment with optimal surgical techniques.</P>
<P>In the last decade, neurosurgeons and intensivists have shown renewed interest in DC for the management of high ICP that is refractory to first- or second-level therapeutic measures. These patients have a dismal outcome if ICP is not controlled quickly. Furthermore, highly favorable patient outcomes have been reported after surgical decompression in small series retrospective cohort studies and prospective non-randomized studies. However, due to the weak methodological design of these studies, these favorable outcomes do not prove the effectiveness of this dramatic therapy and many neurosurgeons are still reluctant to use it. Skepticism about the benefits of this procedure are influenced by the notion shared by many neurosurgeons that even if DC does reduce ICP the functional outcome of the survivors is not improved. Additionally, DC has potential adverse effects such as increased brain edema, subdural collections, hydrocephalus, and brain infarctions.</P>
<P>Both clinical and experimental studies have shown an increase of brain edema when decompressive craniectomy is performed. A common clinical observation is that the brain herniates rapidly through the bone defect, resulting in a tense skin flap (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1979</LINK>). Cooper et al showed that the brains of dogs with an induced cryogenic lesion had a significant increase in brain edema in craniectomized animals compared with control animals despite lower ICP (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1980</LINK>). Animals with a closed skull had a mean lesion volume of 0.27 ± 0.19 ml while craniectomized animals had a mean volume of 1.96 ± 0.19 ml (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1979</LINK>). However, recent experimental studies by Plesnila show that in experimental models of cortical impact injury, a model that induces mainly brain contusions, animals treated with early DC had a lower contusion volume compared with controls (<LINK REF="REF-Plesnila-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plesnila 2007</LINK>). This author showed that brain edema did not increase when DC was performed early after injury (<LINK REF="REF-Plesnila-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plesnila 2007</LINK>). Therefore, whether or not DC enhances brain edema in experimental models is not a closed issue. These findings have never been confirmed in clinical trials.</P>
<P>Despite this skepticism, the number of detected but excluded studies since our first review in 2006 has increased from 61 to 100. This shows a worldwide trend of using DC more frequently, despite the lack of robust evidence to prove its efficacy in improving outcomes.</P>
<P>In this updated version of the systematic review I found only one small single-center RCT, conducted by Taylor et al, that fulfilled the required criteria. This was a well-conducted trial in a pediatric population. The design and implementation of this study presents some issues which could be considered potential flaws: 1) the method of patient allocation (Zelen&#8217;s method), 2) the lack of blinding of the investigators to the assigned arm, 3) the length of time required to enroll the 27 patients included, and 4) the limited brain decompression achieved by the surgical technique used on these patients, in whom the duramater was left closed or only scarified.</P>
<P>Zelen&#8217;s approach has been considered by some to be ethically questionable, while others find it perfectly acceptable (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2004</LINK>). In summary, Zelen&#8217;s randomization method and consent process differ from conventional informed consent in two ways. First, participants are randomized to particular arms of a trial before anyone is asked for consent to participate. Second, only those patients randomized to the experimental arm are informed about the research and asked for consent (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2004</LINK>). Leaving aside ethical discussions, the method is feasible and can be accurate enough if the number of patients that refuse to participate is reported. In addition, an intention-to-treat analysis can also be performed with this design.</P>
<P>The second issue in the Taylor et al study is the unblinding of the investigators to the assigned arm. I believe that this is not necessarily a limitation in a surgical trial, since the investigators cannot be adequately blinded for obvious reasons. The recent CONSORT Statement for non-pharmacological trials recognizes and addresses this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>). With this limitation in mind, every effort has to be made, however, to mask the independent evaluators of the outcome and quality-of-life in these trials. Consequently, when evaluating the quality of these trials the emphasis should be shifted from the blinding of the investigators to appropriate blinding of the evaluators of outcome. The third issue in this trial is the length of time required to enroll patients. I believe this is a shortcoming that is unavoidable in any single-center trial. In our opinion bias could have been introduced in the study by Taylor et al due to the change in management over the seven-year period that the study lasted. However, this would have affected both arms equally. Finally, the brain decompression achieved in adults by bone decompression alone, as performed in this trial, should be considered suboptimal and not recommended for adults.</P>
<P>Despite the above-mentioned limitations the study by Taylor et al is a high-quality trial in which the authors have made every effort to control bias. The decision to stop the trial because of the results of an interim analysis that showed clear efficacy of DC in reducing death and disability is scientifically reasonable and ethically sound when there is lack of clinical equipoise regarding any treatment. The term clinical equipoise, coined by Freedman in 1987, is defined as &#8220;&#8230;honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians about the preferred treatment &#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1987</LINK>); or, in other words, equipoise requires genuine uncertainty about the merits of the interventions studied. If two interventions are in equipoise, it means that there is no good reason for believing that one is superior to the other (<LINK REF="REF-Chiong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiong 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this clinical trial show that decompressive craniectomy was associated with a RR for death of 0.54 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.72) and a RR of 0.54 for death, vegetative status, or severe disability six to 12 months after injury (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). In most patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy, ICP was also controlled. Although ideally these results should be replicated in a larger clinical trial, any ethical review board would be very unlikely to approve a second trial in the pediatric population on the basis of scientific reasons alone.</P>
<P>To date, no results are available in adults to confirm or refute the effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy. However, some prospective, single-center, non-randomized studies suggest that favorable outcome might be expected in selected patients using secondary decompressive craniectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaab-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gaab 1990</LINK>).The significant increase in the number of retrospective or prospective non-randomized studies available in the last two years indicates that DC is being increasingly used despite the lack of strong evidence for its use.</P>
<P>To close our review, the words of Kjellberg and Prieto in their seminal paper are most appropriate, &#8220;We have presented our appraisal of the case material (bifrontal decompressive craniectomy), not so much as proof of its superiority over other methods, but rather as provocation for further critical appraisal of its use&#8221;  (<LINK REF="STD-Kjellberg-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellberg 1971</LINK>). It is probable that, in the near future, the results of the two ongoing randomized clinical trials (RescueICP and DECRA) can shed light on this issue.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-12 12:39:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite many small series and case reports indicating the beneficial effect of secondary decompressive craniectomy on the outcome for patients with severe TBI and increased refractory ICP, no controlled clinical trial has proved that this procedure is more effective in improving outcome than maximal medical therapy in an adult population. Therefore, the routine use of this therapy cannot be recommended in patients older than 18 years of age. However, it would be acceptable to include this procedure as a rescue therapy in patients for whom maximal medical treatment has failed to control ICP. In one pediatric population, a single-center randomized trial showed that decompressive craniectomy, even without opening the duramater, is effective in reducing ICP and mortality and improving functional outcome. However, leaving the duramater intact in these patients should be considered a suboptimal procedure, even in a pediatric population.</P>
<P>Because this procedure is widely used as a rescue therapy in adults, despite the lack of supporting evidence, a critical appraisal of decompressive craniectomy in treating refractory, high ICP is urgently needed. This would require a well-designed randomized multicenter study that takes into consideration the limitations of any surgical trial, including the impossibility of blinding the study. The RescueICP and DECRA trials have the right design to elucidate the review question in adults.</P>
<P>Comparison of results is greatly hampered by the heterogeneity of patient populations included in non-controlled studies and the wide variability in the use of surgical techniques. However, the encouraging results of small non-controlled studies suggest the potential benefits of decompressive surgery in patients with high ICP that is refractory to maximal medical therapy. Indeed, evidence-based guidelines, protocols, and recommendations from both European and North American medical societies consider decompressive craniectomy acceptable as a rescue procedure when medical therapy has failed to control elevated ICP and the existence of surgically evacuable space-occupying lesions have been ruled out (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1999</LINK>). Given the dismal outcome for these patients, it would seem reasonable to include this technique as a last resort in any protocol-driven management plan when conventional therapeutic measures have failed to control high ICP, the presence of operable masses have been ruled out, and the patient still has the possibility of a functional outcome. For definitive answers, randomized clinical trials are required to define which patients might benefit from this procedure. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-12 13:29:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To define the role of secondary decompressive craniectomy in the management of high ICP in patients for whom conventional measures have failed, a randomized controlled trial is clearly needed. Undoubtedly the difficulties of designing, implementing, and funding such a randomized clinical trial are considerable. However, some of the lessons learned in previous non-controlled studies should be taken into account and applied to any potential, prospective controlled study. Some of these recommendations are summarized in the following section.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Recommendations for future clinical trials</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Selection of patients for surgery</HEADING>
<P>In future studies, every effort should be made to avoid decompressive craniectomy in patients with a devastating neurological injury and with a predictable poor outcome regardless of any surgical or non-surgical treatment.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Randomization method</HEADING>
<P>Randomization is a problem in surgical clinical trials in which patients cannot give informed consent to participate, the outcome is generally bad, and the procedure is perceived as aggressive by the patient's family. Furthermore, the decision taken by the next of kin on whether to allow a relative to be included in such a randomized trial has to be made early after injury, when the family is trying to cope with an abrupt and unexpected change in a person's health status. The ethics of Zelen's method of randomization and consent should be debated and may be found acceptable in this particular scenario.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Medical treatment for high ICP</HEADING>
<P>Medical treatment should be strictly defined, homogeneous among participating centers, and follow the best evidence available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. The intracranial pressure threshold for treatment</HEADING>
<P>In a prospective multicenter trial it is essential that a consensus be reached on the threshold to introduce this second-line therapeutic measure. Ideally, a pilot study with various thresholds should be conducted.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Timing</HEADING>
<P>Studies should concentrate on secondary decompressive craniectomy, leaving primary decompression for a later trial. The recommendations made by Shaffrey and Farace on primary versus secondary decompressive craniectomy should be considered. They stated that although both early and late populations might benefit from decompressive craniectomy, these populations should be studied separately. Leaving a bone flap off following a craniectomy for an epidural hematoma is a much different clinical situation than using a large hemi- or bifrontal craniectomy for diffuse cerebral edema (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffrey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffrey 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Extent of bone decompression</HEADING>
<P>The primary goal of decompression is restoration of cerebral perfusion by surgical enlargement of the intracranial space. Wide variability has been found in clinical trials evaluating decompressive craniectomy. Enough bone must be removed to decrease ICP and reduce the risk of venous infarctions associated with small bone openings. In future surgical trials the extent of bone decompression, the limits of craniectomy, whether or not the bone covering the sagittal sinus has to be removed, and the detailed surgical technique should be clearly defined and standardized.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7. Opening the duramater or leaving it closed?</HEADING>
<P>Although some case reports have described good ICP control with duramater scarification, or even with bone decompression alone, it is generally accepted that a large craniectomy with duramater opening and large duraplasty is the best way to achieve the goal. A prospective study by Yoo et al evaluated the efficacy of bone decompression alone in a cohort of 22 patients who underwent bilateral decompressive craniectomy to treat refractory high ICP after either TBI or stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Yoo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 1999</LINK>). The authors monitored ICP before surgery, after bone decompression, and after opening the duramater. A clear finding was that the maximum ICP reduction was only achieved after opening the duramater. The ICP reduction obtained in nine patients with bone decompression alone was modest and the ICP always remained above 20 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Yoo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 1999</LINK>). This pivotal study quantified ICP reduction and provided evidence to support opening the duramater when patients undergo decompressive surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">8. Storage of the bone flap after decompression</HEADING>
<P>The removed bone flap should be stored either frozen in a bone bank or in a subcutaneous pocket in the anterior abdominal wall. When frozen, bone flaps are wrapped in a sterile plastic container, transferred to the bone bank, and frozen at -80 °C. However, bone banks are not available everywhere, especially in developing countries, and using the patient's body to store the flap might be the only option. There is no evidence to prove that one technique for bone preservation is superior to another.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">9. Repositioning of bone flap</HEADING>
<P>The bone flap is replaced at a variable time after decompression. The repositioning of the bone flap in these fragile patients introduces the possibility of a number of complications that have not been well reported. Among them, the most important is infection of the bone flap and subsequent complications. This should be closely monitored for in any clinical trial because it could increase long-term mortality and morbidity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">10. Evaluation of neurological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Evaluation of the outcome should include not only neurological outcomes, using standardized scales such as the Glasgow Outcome Scale or the Glasgow Outcome Extended Scale, but also an evaluation of quality of life measured using a standardized instrument that is more sensitive and robust than the standard TBI outcome scales used for measuring quality of life in survivors.<BR/>

<P>Experimental: patients underwent a bi-temporal craniectomy in addition to maximal medical treatment. A 3-4 cm disc of temporal bone was removed by extending the opening down to the floor of the middle cranial fossa. The duramater was left intact and, in a few cases, was scarified. Controls: maximal medical therapy including barbiturate-induced coma and moderate hypothermia in all cases.

<P>Authors were contacted to obtain further details of the study. The published and unpublished data that were supplied by the author (Dr W Butt) on our request were used to evaluate this study. The reason for the total number of randomized patients ending up as 13 and 14, respectively, despite randomization performed by blocks of four was that an interim analysis was performed and the studies stopped. Because of the nature of this intervention, lack of concealment is an intrinsic limitation of any decompressive study and not a limitation of this particular study. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted but, because of no dropouts or crossovers, no changes were found.</P>

<P>Retrospective cohort study of the decompressive craniotomies performed in a university hospital during a 5-year period. Both primary (27 patients) and secondary (13 patients) decompressive craniotomies were included. Secondary craniectomy was performed in patients with intractable intracranial hypertension and and ICP above 35 mm Hg. Outcome was determined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale score obtained at 12 months. The surgical procedure was chosen according to the site of the cerebral lesion. Bilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed when the CT scan showed diffuse edema without a mass lesion. When a patient showed hemispheric edema, unilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed. Duraplasty was carried out with autologous fascia.

<P>Description of a short series of three adult patients with TBI who underwent decompressive craniectomy after medical treatment failed to control ICP. The authors discuss the three patients extensively and used this short series to discuss how the outcome of DC is related to factors such as the timing of surgery, patient age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, level of intracranial pressure, and some neuroradiological findings. They recommended decompressive surgery when ICP exceeds 50 mm Hg despite maximal medical treatment.</P>

Primary decompressive hemicraniectomy and augmentative duraplasty, with bovine pericardium, was performed to treat patients whose CT scan showed a degree of midline shift not proportional to the volume of a surgically evacuable mass lesion. The main goal of this study was to compare the outcomes of traditional craniectomy versus craniectomy with duraplasty as the initial intervention to control the effects of early brain swelling after severe TBI. The study population was highly selected and patients aged over 40 years with abnormal motor response were excluded.

<P>Randomized multi-center study in which 486 patients with severe TBI and refractory high ICP were randomly assigned to undergo either unilateral standard trauma craniectomy (STC) or what was called limited craniectomy (LC). Patients were enrolled if they had high ICP refractory to first-line therapeutic measures and the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>unilateral brain swelling or contusion with a midline shift of more than 10 mm on CT scan,</LI>
<LI>uni- or bilateral pupillary dilatation unreactive to light for more than 2 hours,</LI>
<LI>an initial GCS between 4-8,</LI>

</OL>
<P>The STC was a 12x15 cm craniectomy with duramater opened and duraplasty performed with temporal fascia. The LC procedure was exactly the same except that the bone removal was smaller (6x8 cm). The evaluator of outcome was blind to the group to which the patient was assigned. This was a high-quality study that had to be excluded because the main goal was to compare two surgical procedures to treat unilateral brain swelling with or without mass lesions. A second important bias that this study had was that decompressive surgery was conducted together with hematoma evacuation and/or contusion resection in an undefined number of patients. Despite these limitations, functional outcome was achieved in 39.8% of the 241 patients assigned to the STC group and in 28.6% of the LC group. The most important conclusion of this study was that a large craniectomy was significantly associated with a better outcome and reduced ICP when compared with a smaller craniectomy.</P>

<P>Retrospective review of the trauma registry at a single center to identify children with severe TBI who underwent primary or secondary decompressive craniectomy between 1996 and 2005. Fifty-one children were identified, of whom 45 underwent a primary decompressive craniectomy in conjunction with removal of a mass lesion. Six patients underwent secondary DC for refractory high ICP. Five of the six children who underwent DC for raised ICP died. Authors did not recommend secondary DC for refractory ICP in patients with no mass lesion. An important bias of this study was that all patients who underwent secondary DC had an ICP above 40 mm Hg and most had uni- or bilateral fixed pupils before surgery.</P>

<P>An excellent and recommended narrative review of the problem of traumatic brain edema and its treatment in the 1960s. The author presented the use of a bifrontal decompressive craniectomy with opening of the duramater and sectioning of the superior sagital sinus. The author suggested that this alternative was much better than the subtemporal craniectomy proposed originally by Cushing in 1905 in patients with brain edema without evacuable mass lesions. The advantage of decompressing the brain in the direction of the fronto-occipital axis was discussed. In this paper, emphasis was placed on the surgical technique used to conduct bifrontal decompressive craniectomy. Miyazaki presented 11 patients treated with this procedure and the dramatic effects of this procedure on ICP measured by lumbar puncture. Eight of the 11 patients survived.</P>

Mean ICP was reduced from 29.2 ± 3.5 mm Hg to 11.1 ± 6.0 mm Hg at one hour after DC and was still significantly lower than baseline at 24 hrs. The relationship between the size of the craniectomy and the decrease in ICP was studied using the Pearson correlation. A larger craniectomy gave a larger decrease in ICP. The survival rate was 17/19 (89%). Of the surviving patients, 13/19 (68%) had a favorable outcome (GOS 4 or 5), 3/19 (16%) were severely disabled (GOS 3), and one patient (5%) was left in a vegetative state.</P>

<P>A comprehensive and excellent narrative review of the role of decompressive surgery in both TBI and malignant cerebral infarction with a discussion of all the important issues still open to debate. In this review the authors added a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with TBI who underwent DC in a seven-year period (2000-2007). Six patients were lost to follow up, leaving a total of 96 for analysis: 18 pediatric patients and 78 adults. In 25 adults decompressive craniectomy was indicated because of neuroradiological signs of diffuse brain swelling or because of refractory high ICP. The mortality rate was 32% (8/25). Thirty-two per cent of patients achieved functional independence. In the pediatric population, seven patients underwent DC, two died, and three achieved a functional outcome.</P>

The main limitation of this study was that 40 of the 66 patients who underwent unilateral DC also had an acute subdural hematoma, five had an acute intracerebral hematoma, and three extradural hematomas. The volume was not reported in any of these mass lesions. In a secondary analysis of the subgroup who underwent DC with no mass lesion, 80% of these patients had an unfavorable outcome according to the dichotomized GOS.

<P>Observational retrospective study of a consecutive series of 26 patients with moderate or severe head injuries who underwent bifrontal decompressive craniectomy for the management of refractory raised ICP, between 1992 and 1999. Six patients were under 16 years of age. Patients were managed according to a strict therapeutic protocol. The ICP threshold used in this study was 30-35 mm Hg depending on CPP. Overall, only 55% of potentially eligible patients underwent craniectomy during the study period. Clinical outcome was categorized using the GOS at least 6 months after surgery. When all patients in the series were taken into consideration, decompressive craniectomy significantly reduced intracranial pressure from 37.5 ± 10.0 to 18.1 ± 16 mm Hg (P = 0.003). In most patients, the reduction in ICP was sustained. In this study, very comprehensive data from pre- and postoperative ICP monitoring was analyzed in eight patients to evaluate the physiological effects of surgery on ICP. Decompressive bifrontal craniectomy significantly reduced: 1) the amplitude of the ICP waveform, 2) the amplitude of slow waves, and 3) the compliance of the intracranial space.</P>

If these stages are unsuccessful in controlling ICP, the patients will be randomized to continuation of medical management versus decompressive craniectomy.</P>
<P>Stage 1: initial treatment measures will consist of sedation, analgesia, and ventilation. If ICP is maintained below 20 mm Hg the above medical treatment will be continued. If ICP is above 20 mm Hg, measures included in stage 2 will be applied.</P>
<P>Stage 2: advanced treatment measures will consist of a number of more advanced maneuvers which may include draining cerebrospinal fluid, mannitol, inotrope, moderate hyperventilation, hypertonic saline, moderate cooling (35-35 °C), loop diuretics, and steroids. Barbiturates are not included as part of stage 2 measures but are reserved as part of continued medical treatment following randomization. This clause enables direct comparison between the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy and maximal medical treatment including the introduction of high-dose barbiturates. If, despite stage 1 and 2 measures, ICP remains above 25 mm Hg for 1 to 12 hours, then patients will be randomized to either continued medical treatment (stage 2) plus high-dose barbiturates or decompressive craniectomy. The allocated treatment will be implemented within 6 hours of randomization. Decompressive surgery may be performed later at the clinician's discretion if the patient subsequently deteriorates (for example prolonged high ICP &gt;40 mm Hg). This clause is required in case a situation arises in which the treating physician feels that withholding surgery would be against the best interests of the individual. The same principle applies to barbiturates in the decompressive craniectomy group.</P>

<P>Lack of concealment is an intrinsic limitation of any decompressive study rather than a limitation of this particular study. Blinding was recorded but was not used as a criterion for the quality of the trial. However, blinding of the evaluator was essential for a study to be considered high quality. Evaluators of outcome were blinded to the allocated treatment.</P>
