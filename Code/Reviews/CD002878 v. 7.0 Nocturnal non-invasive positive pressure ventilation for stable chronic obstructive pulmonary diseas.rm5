This is an excellent update of the review. I have merely corrected a few typos and tidied up the Summary of Findings tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz comments 08/02/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have updated the search methods section to reflect current practice, and added our standard appendix about the Airways Register. The search date in the 'results of the search' section is July 2010. However, a search update was conducted and sent in August 2012. Have these results been incorporated into the review?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We hadn&amp;#8217;t when submitting the first draft. We have added the information now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's comments 04/02/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for submitting the revised review and adding in the new trials. I edited the review as in places there was some repetition - most of the edits I have left in tracked changes for you to be able to see. Can you read through the whole review, check that you agree with the changes and accept them. There are a few outstanding issues to discuss/change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;having spoken to Chris, I know that he is happy with the methods you used which he heard about on your recent teleconference. however, it is hard for the average reader to know what you have done and the methods could be more transparent. Could you please add in a few paragraphs to explain what methods you used - this is especially important because IPD reviews are not that common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;background - Why was an IPD done? This needs a brief explanation - was it because published information does not permit a good quality meta-analysis for example?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We added a few sentences on IPD to the background. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;data extraction and management is a little unclear. Was the IPD reported or did you ask the trial authors for it? Where does the permission come into it? I don't see why you would ask for permissions if it is publicly available. rephrase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;Reply: No, we asked for IPD, &amp;#160;I adjusted the permission sentence. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Methods - the standard headings are now activated in a Cochrane Review and the existing text I have copied and pasted beneath. As you can see there are some missing. I know there is a possible issue as this text will have been generated retrospectively, but it is important for people to be able to understand what was done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We did so.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look at the headings in the table and add more detail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. It appeared that NIPPV and nocturnal-NIPPV were used inconsistently throughout the review and it could be made clearer which you are talking about. Please check edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We did so.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Outcomes&lt;/b&gt;. These have changed since the original review - this needs to be justified in the methods. These are the outcomes from the original version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Blood gases, 6-minute walk (6MWD), dyspnoea (during daily activities), health status (health-related quality of life measurements), and respiratory muscle function (muscle endurance or muscle strength, including PI max (maximal inspiratory pressure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and vital capacity (VC)) and sleep efficiency (time asleep as a percentage of total time in bed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: As only 3 primary outcomes should be listed under primary outcomes, we selected bloodgasses, 6MWD and health status after having spoken to Chris Cates and Emma Welsh. We have changed the order in all text and tables throughout the review.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract - &lt;/b&gt;was there any additional data than the 245 IPD? it is presently unclear in the abstract and this requires re-wording e.g. to say that you were able to obtain IPD for all patients in all included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We used your suggestion, it is indeed clearer this way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Included studies&lt;/b&gt; - could you provide a little more information about the characteristics of the individuals in the studies e.g. age, severity of COPD, interventions (masks etc). I added in details of the funding of trials as this is now expected in Cochrane reviews, so if you could briefly summarise that as well, that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We summarized some characteristics. As we performed IPD, we gave averages for the total IPD instead of characteristics per study.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;selective reporting&lt;/b&gt; paragraph sounds like you think the studies were at unclear risk of bis, but the figure is all green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt; Reply: We were unsure about this. We now changed this to unclear for all studies. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;effects of intervention&lt;/b&gt;s - 'there were a serious number of drop outs' - this does not seem to match the ROB statement. Please verify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Reply: We changed this to some drop-outs. The 2 studies that had a relatively high amount, were judged as high risk of bias.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some instances of repetition in the discussion. I tried to re-order it for you, but only felt comfortable doing this partially - can you look through the changes and write something under Overall completeness and applicability. The handbook says the following on this: &amp;quot;Describe the relevance of the evidence to the review question. This should lead to an overall judgement of the external validity of the review. Are the studies identified sufficient to address all of the objectives of the review? Have all relevant types of participants, interventions and outcomes been investigated? Comments on how the results of the review fit into the context of current practice might be included here, although authors should bear in mind that current practice might vary internationally.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table &lt;/b&gt;- this is missing. Could you add one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reply: We added a SOF table, which we emailed about with Chris and Emma. I am however in doubt what to pu under Setting: I have now written 'Primary Care', and marked it in yellow as I am unsure. Patients start in Hospital with training, but go home to use the ventilator there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funding was added to all studies as requested, but I think I found a mistake for the study of Sin. Some kind of Spanish funding from Sao Paulo was put there which I could not find anywhere in the article itself. &amp;#160;I looked it up and changed it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;This version sent to PW - 05/05/02 (Clib issue 3, 2002). Do not delete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy for this to go on to Paul now. CJC 4/1/02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Peter Wijkstra&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Comments added in response to PJP Jan 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PJP 28 December 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter and Chris - Overall this is looking much better and certainly much easier to follow. I have gone through and edited spelling/grammar ( not to alter meaning), and added hypertext links to the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few outstanding issues- please could you have a look and address- or debate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The main comment is this:&lt;br&gt;Because this is possibly the first Airways review to use both individual and summary statistics it is a groundbreaking review. It is important to detail how you did the meta analysis and how the two methodologies compared- it will set the scene for further ones!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the statistical considerations section-suggest you add a sentence along the lines of &amp;quot; Two separate meta analyses were performed in this review. The first analysis used individual patient data kindly provided by the investigators (link to table 1)........... then your description of how you did it............The second analysis was a standard Cochrane analysis using weighted mean differences calculated from summary statistics using the method of Peto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Results section write a section comparing the results of the two methods. This could be under the heading &amp;quot;Comparison between the analysis of individual patient data and analysis using summary statistics.&amp;quot; This could include much of your discussion in the note below.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1) I did as you suggested&lt;br&gt;2. I don't think you can make too much of the non-significant but larger effect on 6MWD - it may be a type 2 error caused by small sample sizes but equally it may be because there is no difference.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;2) May be you are right but we prefer to leave it this way in the text. The&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bottom line of the review is that because off small numbers there are no&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;strong conclusions possible.&lt;br&gt;3. Contributions of each of the reviewers- please add to Reviewers/contributions&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;3) I did.&lt;br&gt;4. Synopsis- please add a 3 sentence text for laypeople or consumers - I can assist if you like.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;4) Please have a look at it, if this is what you want.&lt;br&gt;5. Under Methodological Quality, it would help the reader if you did put in a sentence or 2 descibing the Jadad scores of the 4 studies and whether the concealment was adequate or inadequate. Also, the numbers in the meta analysis are much smaller (in general) than the numbers you state were included in the trials. Presumably this is because there were drop outs even during the first treatment period. You might like to comment on the relative numbers of dropouts and the reasons why.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;5) I added this to the section methodological quality of the studies and&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;results.&lt;br&gt;6. It would be helpful to add what PImax is and what it represents (suggest add under Outcomes).&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;6) I did.&lt;br&gt;7. In Results, you say that the results of the studies are in Table 02 - I cant find this- do you mean Table 1? If so, a hypertext link can go to that table.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;7) Indeed, it should be table 1.&lt;br&gt;8. I have altered the axis label on comparison 0103- a higher PI max is better? Please check I am right!&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;8) You are right.&lt;br&gt;9. In Discussion/Limitations of included studies ( line 6) please clarify what is reference (29)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;9) I changed it into Meecham Jones&lt;br&gt;10. In the Characteristics of Included studies need to put details of the control in the Interventions box for the 3rd and 4th studies&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;10) I added this to the details of the control interventions.&lt;br&gt;That's all- hopefully not too much to fix -and it can quickly get to Paul Jones and onto the Library&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11/12/2001&lt;br&gt;This is waiting for me to put in the cross-over and parallel raw data. ... I have now entered the parallel group results and first arm data from cross-over trials for CHANGE IN THE SPECIFIED OUTCOMES. This may vary slightly from the reported results in table 1 (as I guess absolute post treatment values may have been used). There do not appear to be important differences however.&lt;br&gt;I have performed a separate analysis of some outcomes pooling the parallel and crossover trials in RevMan 4.2 alpha and although the weights are different the conclusions are much the same. However there is HETEROGENEITY when the cross-over trials are entered using paired data. This is perhaps not surprising in view of the different controls used in the trials (GAY is the only one with a sham NIPPV arm for example).&lt;br&gt;The bottom line is that the numbers are very small overall so hard to draw many conclusions in my view. The PI Max effect is not significant when all trials are pooled using inverse variance.&lt;br&gt;Peter - how did you enter the data from the cross-over trials in your meta-analysis?&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;PJP 18 July 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good to see this is well on the way.Well done for obtaining the individual pat data. Now we need to see the result of the analysis of the individual pt data. Here are some comments. Let me know if you agree or disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't altered anything in the text to date:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I) In the text you refer to meta analysis. More correctly this is a systematic review. The Meta analysis is the statistical technique of joining the results together. This review is far more that that! There is no meta analysis as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) Need to put the data there for all to see and draw conclusions from. See Revman Handbook about using individual pat data - main difference is that you will reanalyse the data and present it back to the authors before entering the summary stats into Revman for the meta analysis. I can't see Table 2- am I using the right version?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to set up a table of comparisons- I/e/ how you are going to portray the data., and then enter the data which will automatically appear in metaview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;need to decide what you can combine. i.e. best not to combine cross overs with parallel studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably should analyse separately the trials which were NIPPV vs Sham and NIPPV vs standard and NIPPV vs O2 treatment alone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the tables of comparisons for a few of the Cochrane Reviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) In the description of studies section don't reproduce what is in the Table of included studies - need to make it very easy fro the read to see what types of trials and participants were included -- e.g. there were 2 crossover trials, 3 had nocturnal BiPAp, mean age of all participatnts , mean FEV etc etc setting, withdrawals( again have a look at a few reviews - e.g. mucolytics in COPD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;iv) in Types of studies state what the minumium duration for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(v) in Types of interventions you state that control was standard thereapy alone, howver you have inlcuded studies with Sham and o2 rx as controls. Should comment on the different controls and suggest in discussion what you recommned as the best control in this type of trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(vi) in Types of Outcomes- lung function included PI max as well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;PJP 12 Sept 00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter&lt;br&gt;This is looking really good. Well done for mastering the Revman so quickly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added in smoking cessation to 1st paragraph-It is the most important intervention and now that there are proven agents such as bupropion and NRT to treat this addiction, we should always consider it in therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have corrected a few typos and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please can you add more detailed contact details and list your co reviewers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a section in Revman for your references. These would be listed under &amp;quot;other references&amp;quot;-useful as you can hyperlink to them using the link toolbar. Suggest you cut and paste these to this part of Revman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 17:23:51 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="NOC-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-10 11:21:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a method to assist or replace spontaneous breathing (or normal breathing) with the aid of a machine called a ventilator. A mask is fitted over the nose or mouth, or both and air is pushed into the lungs. It can be used as a short-term measure, during critical instances in the hospital, but also at home for longer periods in people who have raised levels of carbon dioxide in their blood. We wanted to discover whether using NIPPV at home during the night alongside standard therapy was better or worse than standard therapy alone in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. In 2002, we published our original Cochrane review looking at this. It is important to check if new studies have been published that could be added to the existing studies in the review. In this review, we performed a new search and found new studies and, therefore, this is an update of the review published in 2002.</P>

<B>What is individual patient data?</B> In this review we used individual patient data. This means we collected original research data for each participant from the original researchers who performed the studies. We used this information to perform our calculations.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>What is the effect of NIPPV in people with COPD on blood gases, six-minute walking distance, health-related quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle function and sleep efficiency.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>The evidence is current to August 2012. We found seven studies that reported the effects of NIPPV at home. Five of these studies looked at the effects after using NIPPV compared to regular treatment (without NIPPV) for at least three months. Two studies looked for a longer period of time, for at least 12 months. The mean age of all participants included in our meta-analysis was 67 years. All studies included men and women, but 77% of participants were men. We used data from 245 people for our meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Results: </B>NIPPV during the night for 3 and 12 months in people with COPD who had raised levels of carbon dioxide had no clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, six-minute walking distance, health-related quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle strength and sleep efficiency. This means we found little or no difference in the outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the results: </B>Because some trials had very small numbers of participants, our confidence in the quality of evidence is moderate when looking at the effects on gas exchange. All seven trials measured this outcome. Other outcomes were not always measured or available leading to a lower quality of evidence for the other outcomes such as six-minute walking distance, health-related quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle function and sleep efficiency.</P>

<P>This update of the systematic review on nocturnal-NIPPV in COPD (<A HREF="Wijkstra 2002">Wijkstra 2002</A>), has led to the inclusion of three new studies, leading to seven included studies on 245 people. We obtained IPD for all participants in all included studies. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of all outcomes included zero. These included partial pressure of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>2 </SUB>in arterial blood, six-minute walking distance (6MWD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and sleep efficiency. The mean effect on 6MWD was small at 27.7 m and not statistically significant. Given the width of the 95% CI (-28.1 to 66.3 m), the real effect of NIPPV on 6MWD is uncertain and we cannot exclude an effect that is clinically significant (considering that the minimal clinically difference on 6MWD is around 26 m).</P>

<P>Nocturnal-NIPPV at home for at least three months in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD had no consistent clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, exercise tolerance, HRQoL, lung function, respiratory muscle strength or sleep efficiency.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-11 14:32:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:45:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are several therapeutic options to help people with COPD manage their symptoms, but to date, only smoking cessation and the provision of long-term oxygen therapy to hypoxic patients have been shown to prolong life (<LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>). Usually, treatment is with bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids), although the latter is still controversial in people with COPD. When medication doses are optimal and people still have dyspnoea or an impaired exercise tolerance, pulmonary rehabilitation can be added to medical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006</LINK>). In people with more severe COPD, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Slebos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slebos 2012</LINK>), lung volume reduction surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1997</LINK>), and, in extreme cases, lung transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Orens-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orens 2006</LINK>), can be considered. In people with COPD with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure nocturnal non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (nocturnal-NIPPV) might be beneficial.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:45:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>In non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), the person receives ventilatory support through a non-invasive interface, such as a nasal mask, full-facemask or helmet. NIPPV is currently applied as evidence-based therapy in people with COPD admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation. It has been shown that NIPPV reduces hospital deaths and complications associated with treatment and length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2004</LINK>). NIPPV during an acute exacerbation is often applied intermittently or continuously for a few days to reduce the (life-threatening) ventilatory failure, after which the person is weaned from ventilation and treatment is ended. Chronic nocturnal-NIPPV, however, entails the use of NIPPV at home during the night for a longer period. Currently there is much discussion about the need for NIPPV in COPD, mainly because conflicting results have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Rossi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 2000</LINK>). There is consensus, but with little supportive evidence, that people with COPD who have substantial daytime hypercapnia and superimposed nocturnal hypoventilation are most likely to benefit from NIPPV (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:45:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>Several theories exist as to why nocturnal-NIPPV might be beneficial. First, nocturnal-NIPPV might rest chronically fatigued muscles. Periods of rest may lead to recovery of the inspiratory muscle function, thereby leading to an increased muscle strength and endurance capacity of the respiratory muscles during the daytime (<LINK REF="REF-Ambrosino-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambrosino 1990</LINK>). Second, nocturnal-NIPPV has been shown to improve sleep time and efficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Meecham-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meecham 1995</LINK>), as people with severe COPD can experience poor sleep quality due to sleep-disordered breathing with episodes of hypoventilation associated with desaturation. Third, nocturnal-NIPPV may ameliorate nocturnal hypoventilation and allow the respiratory centre to be reset. In this way nocturnal-NIPPV may reduce daytime hypercapnia (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1991</LINK>). Fourth, it is postulated that nocturnal-NIPPV decreases hyperinflation leading to an improvement in respiratory mechanics, such as an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) and a decrease in residual volume (<LINK REF="REF-Duiverman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duiverman 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-11 14:32:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>Despite all these theories, the effect of nocturnal-NIPPV in people with stable severe COPD remains unclear and needs further investigation. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002. Since then, more studies have been reported, making an update necessary. As in 2002, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD). With IPD, we collected original research data for each participant from the original researchers for data checking, validation and re-analysis. This gives an advantage over the conventional meta-analysis based on summary statistics from published papers as more or different analyses are possible. IPD meta-analyses have greater power, enabling investigation of additional hypothesis related to individual characteristics, for example within subgroups or treatment across trials, or both.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:47:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>Two review authors (FMS and PJW) assessed risk of bias of each study independently (for details see 'Risk of bias' table in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We used criteria for assessment of risk of bias as provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We considered potential for bias using the following domains:</P>

<P>The principal investigators of all the trials included in the meta-analysis kindly provided the individual data for each of their study subjects. We therefore conducted an individual data meta-analysis. We expressed study outcomes in the same natural units across the trials. For each individual and for each outcome, we calculated an absolute difference in score that defined treatment effect. An overall treatment effect (mean difference and associated 95% confidence interval (CI)) was obtained from the difference in scores under each study condition (NIPPV minus controls). Different proportions of participants contributed to the different outcomes.</P>

<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the results of the meta-analysis based on IPD. There is a difference between the number of participants included in the studies and the number included in the meta-analysis. There were some dropouts in most studies, for the short-term follow-up this was often due to intolerance of the nose mask, intercurrent infections or participants no longer meeting the inclusion criteria after a stabilisation period. In both studies looking at long-term effects, this was often due to progression of the disease and reluctance of participants to return to hospital for follow-up measurements. Finally, not all parameters were measured in all participants and, therefore, there is a difference in number of participants per outcome.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:54:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Hayes">
<P>In this update, IPD from three new studies were added to the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2002</LINK>), and two of these studies were conducted over 12 months, which means we now have some long-term data on which to base our conclusions, including long-term information on quality of life outcomes. Nocturnal-NIPPV at home for at least three months in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD had no consistent clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, exercise tolerance, lung function, respiratory muscle strength or sleep efficiency. Meta-analysis of the two new long-term studies did not show significant improvements in blood gases, HRQoL or lung function after 12 months of NIPPV.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:54:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>In this meta-analysis, we did not find statistically significant effects in any included outcomes. By adding data of PaCO<SUB>2 </SUB>after three months from two studies in this update, the improvement of 2.5 mmHg was still not significantly different but the CIs now only just exceeded zero. The small sample size precludes a definitive statement regarding the clinical implications of NIPPV, other than stating that at present there is insufficient evidence to support its widespread use.</P>
<P>Although the improvement of 27.7 m in the 6MWD is not statistically significant, it could be clinically significant as it does reach the clinically minimal important difference of 26 m (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>). This meta-analysis of 6WMD after three months, however, was only based on 40 participants and although not contributing to the meta-analysis, the long-term study of <LINK REF="STD-Clini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clini 2002</LINK> looking at effects on 6MWD after 12 months of NIPPV only found a very small improvement of 3.2 m (95% CI -49.7 to 56.1) in 46 participants.</P>
<P>The upper limit of the CI of 66 m for the 6MWD in the meta-analysis suggests that it remains possible that NIPPV has beneficial effects on walking in at least some people, but it is not possible to identify these people a priori. Additional studies with larger sample sizes that address participant selection, ventilator settings, training and NIPPV compliance should clarify the role of this treatment.</P>
<P>Not all outcomes could be combined because of measurements with different scales. Dyspnoea was measured in three studies, but as this was measured with the 5-point MRC scale (<LINK REF="STD-Casanova-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Casanova 2000</LINK>) and 6-point MRC scale (<LINK REF="STD-Clini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clini 2002</LINK>), Borg (<LINK REF="STD-Casanova-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Casanova 2000</LINK>), or TDI (<LINK REF="STD-Strumpf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Strumpf 1991</LINK>) and different lengths of follow-up, data could not be combined. The same applied to HRQoL; three studies examined this outcome but all used different questionnaires ranging from the more generic SF-36 questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2009</LINK>) and the (lung) disease specific St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Clini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meecham-Jones-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meecham Jones 1995</LINK>) to the Maugeri Respiratory Failure questionnaire-28 (MRF-28) (<LINK REF="STD-Clini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clini 2002</LINK>), designed for people with respiratory failure. For future studies, it would be of great benefit if the same questionnaires were to be used making comparison and pooling of data possible. The effect of NIPPV may not be captured by the HRQoL questionnaires currently analysed. Several studies have shown good reliability and validity of the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire and the MRF-28, specifically for people with COPD with hypercapnic respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Duiverman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duiverman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windisch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windisch 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested to use both these questionnaires, as the SRI focuses more on psychological aspects and the MRF-28 focuses on restrictions of daily living. But moreover, a large trial also looking at the effect of NIPPV on survival, exacerbation frequency and admissions is needed.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:54:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Seven (three new to this update) RCTs with individual data from 245 people were included in this systematic review. Meta-analysis was performed when trials used similar outcome measures. Short-term trials were analysed as one group, measuring effects of NIPPV after three months. Long-term trials comprised the second group, measuring effects of NIPPV after 12 months. All studies described how randomisation was performed and described adequate allocation concealment. Mainly the short-term studies had few participants (between 7 and 36 participants) and sometimes showed large CIs for some outcome measures such as PImax (<LINK REF="STD-Strumpf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Strumpf 1991</LINK>). Two studies show a high dropout rate after randomisation because people were not able to tolerate NIPPV (<LINK REF="STD-Gay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strumpf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Strumpf 1991</LINK>). Only results from the completers were reported, which could make outcomes susceptible to selection bias. In the other studies, dropout due to non-tolerance was considered small. The two larger studies with long-term follow-up had quite large dropout rates but mainly due to progression of the disease and unwillingness to repeat tests; these were similar amounts between groups. Both studies performed ITT analysis and per-protocol analysis. In this systematic update we only included complete data.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis in this review was performed based on IPD. Treatment effects can, therefore, be seen as more conservative (with wider CIs). They take into account not only interstudy variation, but also intrastudy variation.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations regarding the setup of the meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>The design of this meta-analysis included only studies in which nocturnal-NIPPV was applied for at least five hours per night. This excluded two studies that reported beneficial effects from NIPPV administered for two hours during the day (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Renston 1994</LINK>). In keeping with the application of mechanical ventilatory support for people with thoracic restriction or neuromuscular conditions, we considered night-time ventilation to be the most appropriate clinical approach and reasoned that several hours would be required to achieve therapeutic goals. Furthermore, a minimum duration of three weeks was chosen, as from our own clinical experience we were aware that it might take up to two weeks just for mask fitting, adjustment and patient familiarisation with non-invasive ventilation. Therefore, one study in which NIPPV was assessed for only two weeks was excluded from the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1996</LINK>).<BR/>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations regarding the included studies</HEADING>
<P>We included RCTs that determined the effects of NIPPV versus normal medical treatment. However, it is questionable whether NIPPV with IPAP pressures below 14 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O is enough to improve ventilation. As the most appropriate NIPPV settings have yet to be established, it is unclear whether pressures of 10 to 14 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O are the optimal pressures for improving ventilation in people with COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Casanova-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Casanova 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 1996</LINK>). Since the 1990s, several non-randomised trials studied a new form of NIPPV aimed at maximally reducing PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> levels by means of high IPAP pressures (<LINK REF="REF-Windisch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windisch 2009</LINK>). This form is called high-intensity NIPPV (HI-NIPPV) where pressures are carefully increased from 20 H<SUB>2</SUB>O up to 40 H<SUB>2</SUB>O depending on patient comfort and tolerance. These studies all had a mean IPAP of around 30 H<SUB>2</SUB>O and showed improvements in blood gases and alveolar ventilation during spontaneous breathing, and also improvements in lung function and HRQoL. One randomised controlled cross-over trial subsequently followed comparing six weeks of HI-NIPPV (mean IPAP 29 H<SUB>2</SUB>O in controlled mode) to six weeks of low-intensity NIPPV (mean IPAP 15 H<SUB>2</SUB>O in assist mode) (<LINK REF="REF-Dreher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreher 2010</LINK>). Thirteen people completed the trial and a mean treatment effect on PaCO<SUB>2 </SUB>of 9.2 mmHg (95% CI -13.7 to -4.6) in favour of HI-NIPPV was shown, as well as an improved FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC and HRQoL as assessed by the SRI. Somewhat surprisingly, participants showed a higher compliance in the HI-NIPPV group. One randomised cross-over study of 15 people was performed to investigate the acute physiological changes during 30 minutes of both forms of NIPPV in stable COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Luk_x00e1_csovits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lukácsovits 2012</LINK>). Significant improvements in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> during HI-NIPPV (mean IPAP 28 H<SUB>2</SUB>O) compared to low NIPPV (mean IPAP 18 H<SUB>2</SUB>O) were also found in this study, However, the decrease in cardiac output was significantly more pronounced with HI-NIPPV, leading the authors to speculate on possible limitations of this method for people with pre-existing cardiac disease.</P>
<P>One published, long-term RCT that compared the effects of NIPPV, not to standard care, but in addition to rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Duiverman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duiverman 2011</LINK>), showed a significant decrease in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> in the NIPPV plus rehabilitation group as compared to the rehabilitation only group. Interestingly, although mean levels of IPAP after three months were 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O and after two years were 23 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, there was no relationship identified between the change in PaCO<SUB>2 </SUB>and the level of IPAP (or with the inspiratory pressure difference (IPAP minus EPAP)). Change in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> after three months did correlate with baseline PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> or with the number of hours of NIPPV use per day.</P>

<P>In 2007, one systematic review on NIPPV in people with stable COPD was published (<LINK REF="REF-Kolodziej-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolodziej 2007</LINK>).

They found improvements in blood gasses, hyperinflation and work of breathing, but only in a combined analysis of non-randomised trials with evident heterogeneity. This heterogeneity was probably the result of including studies with different lengths of follow-up, usages per day and types of ventilation (during the day or at night).</P>

<P>Nocturnal-non-invasive positive pressure ventilation at home for 3 and 12 months in hypercapnic patients with COPD had no clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, exercise tolerance, quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle strength or sleep efficiency.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-10 09:54:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should focus on adequate patient selection, ventilator settings, training and length of ventilation, as well as exacerbation frequency, admissions to hospital and survival. During ventilation, people should be monitored carefully, to observe more precisely the changes that are occurring with non-invasive ventilation. Long-term non-invasive ventilation for people with COPD should only be started in the context of a clinical trial, preferably with agreed upon common outcome parameters.<BR/>

<P>* An overall treatment effect (mean difference and associated 95% CI) was obtained from the difference in scores under each study condition (NIPPV minus controls). Individual patient data were analysed using a linear mixed model to compare the treatment effects. Treatment and time of follow-up (3 and 12 months) were analysed with interaction terms as fixed factors. To consider the homogeneity among trials, a random factor was defined in the statistical models. Statistical significance (P value &lt; 0.05) in the test of homogeneity suggested that the observed difference in the treatment effects was in part attributable to the study effect.</P>
