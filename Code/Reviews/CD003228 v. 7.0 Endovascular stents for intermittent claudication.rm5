<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Searches were run and five additional studies were found but had to be excluded from the review because data could not be separated for patients with intermittent claudication. Risk of bias tables were added to the review. A recommendation was made that the review should be updated as soon as the results of recently completed studies are published but that the scope of the review should be broadened to include patients with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia. </P>

<P>Intermittent claudication is a cramping leg pain that develops when walking and is relieved with rest. It is caused by inadequate blood flow to the leg muscles because of atherosclerosis (fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries blocking blood flow). People with mild-to-moderate claudication are advised to keep walking, stop smoking and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Possible treatments include exercise, drugs, bypass surgery or angioplasty. Angioplasty involves expanding the narrowed artery. This can be done by inflating a 'balloon' inside the artery. Sometimes stents (thin metal sleeves) are inserted to keep the artery open.</P>
<P>The review authors identified two controlled studies in which a total of 104 participants (68 male and 36 female) with intermittent claudication were randomised to receive the same type of endovascular stent (Palmaz) or balloon angioplasty alone. This review found that there is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of using stents with angioplasty over angioplasty alone to treat intermittent claudication.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-26 12:37:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is pain in the legs on exercise, caused by an inadequate supply of oxygen to the muscles (ischaemia). It is associated with stenosis (narrowing) or occlusion of the arteries. The diagnosis is based on the classical symptom of pain or discomfort when walking at an ordinary pace on the level, which is aggravated by walking up an incline and relieved by rest (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1992</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of IC varies between 2.2% and 7.0 % of the general adult population aged between 45 and 74 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hughson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dewhurst-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewhurst 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). Individuals with IC have a reduced overall survival compared to controls due to increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease and non-haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the preferred management of individuals with IC remains a subject of discussion, if patients with IC still have unacceptable disability after modification of risk factors and the best available medical management (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2006</LINK>), then interventional therapy may include either percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) or operative by-pass surgery. PTA can lead to an immediate increase in the calibre of the arterial lumen that is secondary to disruption and compression of the atheromatous plaque and dilation of the native vessel (<LINK REF="REF-Belli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belli 1993</LINK>). With its versatility (<LINK REF="REF-Ahn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahn 1992</LINK>), patient preference and low complication rate (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Keeffe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Keeffe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Axisa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axisa 2002</LINK>), PTA has become an increasingly viable option for patient management (<LINK REF="REF-Whyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyman 1996</LINK>). However, the results on primary arterial patency following PTA remain inconsistent (<LINK REF="REF-Tegtmeyer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tegtmeyer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-el_x002d_Bayar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">el-Bayar 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Price-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to improve the outcome of PTA, endovascular stents as originally described by (<LINK REF="REF-Dotter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dotter 1989</LINK>) have been used (<LINK REF="REF-Blum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vorwerk-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorwerk 1995</LINK>). Since their introduction many different designs of stent have been developed, although all vascular stents remain either balloon or self-expanding. The focus of this review was to present the evidence from randomised clinical trials in which various outcomes were reported after the use of endovascular stents (either balloon-expandable or self-expanding) in the treatment of adults with intermittent claudication, compared to participants receiving angioplasty alone.</P>

<P>For the original review, extensive MEDLINE and EMBASE searches (up to and including January 2001) were performed by the authors. The Journal of Vascular Interventional Radiology (1990 to 2001) was handsearched by one of the authors (PT). Further trial reports were sought through examination of proceedings from vascular, surgical and radiological society meetings (the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the European Vascular Surgical Society; the North American Society of Vascular Surgery; the Society for Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology; the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology Society of Europe; and the British Society of Interventional Radiology). Contact was made with authors of published trials requesting information about any eligible unpublished trials and with manufacturers of endovascular stents. One stent manufacturer responded to written enquiries (Merck Pharmaceuticals, United Kingdom) however no published or unpublished data were available for the purposes of the review.</P>

<P>For the update, identified studies were assessed independently by two authors (HM, KW) using the checklist provided by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group. An emphasis was placed on concealment of randomisation. Studies were excluded if they were not randomised, were quasi-randomised controlled trials, made comparisons other than those pre-specified by the review authors and included patients with either acute or critical ischaemia. Each review author assessed the methodological quality of selected trials without prior consideration of the results. Review authors were not blinded to the names of study authors, institutions or journals. Disagreements between the two authors were resolved by discussion followed, where necessary, by referral to the Co-ordinating Editor.</P>

In the other group, studies examining the role of endovascular stents for infra-inguinal disease (femoro-popliteal occlusive pathology) were included. Data extraction from the included studies was performed independently by the same two authors using a proforma designed by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group. Only published data have been used for the purposes of this review but unpublished data were sought. Differences of opinion relating to the data extraction process were again resolved by local discussion between the authors and referral to the Co-ordinating Editor for comment, where necessary.</P>

<P>Statistical analyses were performed according to the statistical guidelines for reviews outlined in the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group module (<LINK REF="REF-PVD-Group-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">PVD Group 2009</LINK>). Odds ratios were used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. Where sufficient data were available, a summary statistic for each outcome was calculated using a fixed-effect model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the data were analysed in continuous form (that is as mean differences).</P>
<P>If different scales were used in the different studies the results were standardised and then combined (as mean differences), where possible. If there had been sufficient trials to warrant subgroup analysis, some categories of participants may have been considered separately, for example groups prescribed different antiplatelet, anticoagulation, or lipid lowering regimes; individuals undergoing endovascular intervention at more than one site; the use of different types of endovascular stents; and variations in policy (routine versus selective stent insertion). Future updates of this review will incorporate these data, if available.</P>

<P>Two studies were identified which satisfied the inclusion criteria. They studied the outcome from angioplasty alone, or angioplasty and stent insertion in a total of 104 participants (68 male, 36 female) with intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2001</LINK>). The number of participants in the two studies were similar and both recruited more men than women. Each study reported a similar inclusion criterion of disease confined to the femoro-popliteal (above knee) artery as well as similar exclusion criteria: multisegmental disease, poor run-off, or disease in the below knee popliteal artery. Both study centres assessed the morphology and distribution of the arterial disease based on information obtained from intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography.</P>
<P>Although all participants in the experimental arm of both included studies received the same type of endovascular stent (Palmaz), the method with which it was deployed differed. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2001</LINK>) preferred to pre-dilate the target lesion to 5 to 6 mm using balloon angioplasty prior to deploying the stent and confirmed the correct positioning of the stent with angiography on completion of the procedure whereas neither of these techniques were used by researchers in the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, in the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2001</LINK>) participants received an additional 5000 unit bolus of heparin prior to angioplasty followed by an intravenous heparin infusion for 48 hours, and oral warfarin for three months compared to the controls. Participants in the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Vroegindeweij-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vroegindeweij 1997</LINK>) received a bolus heparin load of 5000 units and 1g of intravenous aspirin prior to angioplasty.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-09-28 12:57:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Claudication is generally a benign condition in terms of symptom progression. The decision to implant a stent should result in long-term improvement in patency of the blood vessel and clinical improvement when compared to angioplasty alone, and should not result in additional morbidity. The clinical symptoms and the long-term outcome of critical ischaemia differ from those of claudication in that they are dependent on shorter-term patency of blood vessels and the effects of limb salvage. We therefore considered that it was essential to separate and exclude studies in which the patient population of the trial included both participants with claudication and critical ischaemia. A differing response to endoluminal therapy between the iliac and infra-inguinal vessels, resulting from different haemodynamic environments, would have necessitated separation of trials and analysis of results. As it was, the only controlled trials eligible for inclusion in this review concentrated on the femoro-popliteal segment. Neither study was able to convincingly identify a clinically significant advantage or disadvantage in arterial patency or walking ability associated with the use of endovascular stents. These null results from the reported primary outcomes are followed by similar data for secondary outcome variables, in particular post-interventional ABPI (<LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2001</LINK>) and the need for repeat procedures during intermediate follow up.</P>
<P>Both studies evaluated the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent, a well proven but ageing design. More recently, manufacturers have made claims that newer stents are less prone to neointimal hyperplasia by virtue of their self-expanding design and lower metal content. The development of stents coated with cytostatic agents that suppress cell growth, is already showing promising improvements in patency in the coronary arteries. It is certain that further evaluation of stents in the treatment of claudication both above and below the groin is required. It may well be that this is an appropriate time to assess this new technology.</P>
<P>The results of this review fail to provide robust evidence in favour of either angioplasty and stenting or angioplasty alone for any primary or secondary outcome. The use of endovascular stents appears technically safe and does not in itself appear to compromise outcome.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-09-28 12:59:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From this review it can be concluded that there has been inadequate scientific evaluation using randomised controlled trials of endovascular stents in the management of patients with purely intermittent claudication, in either the aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal arterial segments. Unfortunately the review authors were unable to include any additional published trials because data on patients presenting with intermittent claudication at baseline were not available. Given this and the likelihood that there are unlikely to be such trials we would recommend that the scope of this review be broadened to include patients with both intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia. This would allow the evidence from many of the excluded studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zdanowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zdanowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cejna-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cejna 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grenacher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grenacher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fast-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fast 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Saxon 2008</LINK>) and ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chalmers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chalmers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2007</LINK>) to be considered for inclusion.

<P>Methodological weaknesses in the included studies compromised the value of their results. The two included studies were both small with imprecise estimates of treatment differences. They provided no priori power calculation, reported outcomes after a relatively short follow-up period, and there was no reporting of blinding of outcome assessors to reduce bias. Data reported by the trials appear to be predominantly limited to secondary outcome measures, whilst potentially relevant outcome measures such as quality of life and economic impact of stenting were not reported at all. The issue of additional anticoagulation amongst participants in the stented group remains a confounding variable and potential source of bias. Vascular laboratory investigation, duplex scanning in particular, is routinely used as a surrogate measure of clinical outcome when comparing different interventions. Whilst this is a useful diagnostic procedure, its use as a proxy measure of outcome must be cautioned as inter-observer variation, scanning technique, and machine type may all affect the accuracy of the data. It is also noted that intravascular sonography may in fact be the most accurate means of identifying in-stent restenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzenberg 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Despite the different perspectives from which the use of endovascular stents could be assessed (patient-orientated, clinical, physiological, anatomical, or radiological), this review failed to convincingly demonstrate that the use of stents in intermittent claudication improved outcome, from any perspective. There is no clear scientific evidence to recommend the use of angioplasty and stenting in preference to angioplasty alone in patients with intermittent claudication in either the aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal segments. We have been unable to challenge our hypothesis that angioplasty alone is inferior to angioplasty with endovascular stenting in any part of the arterial tree. We are unable to recommend any specific stent as superior to any other. Although it is appreciated that endovascular stents present important economic considerations, our review cannot present any economic data.</P>
