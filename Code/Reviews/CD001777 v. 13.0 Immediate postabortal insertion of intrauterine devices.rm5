<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-05 17:07:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inserting an intrauterine device (IUD) right after an abortion or miscarriage can be good for many reasons. The woman is not pregnant and may be thinking about birth control, and the time and place are convenient for the woman. If asked to delay IUD insertion, many women do not return to get the device. However, the IUD might be more likely to come out on its own if put in right after abortion or miscarriage. This review looked at how safe it was to insert an IUD right after abortion or miscarriage. We also looked at whether the IUD stayed in.</P>
<P>We did computer searches for randomised trials of IUDs inserted right after abortion or miscarriage. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare types of IUDs or times for insertion. We found 12 studies to include.</P>
<P>Four trials randomised women to an IUD inserted right away or at a later time. One had no major difference. Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. A subanalysis showed more IUDs came out when inserted right after abortion or miscarriage rather than later.</P>
<P>Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. The IUD was more likely to come out on its own when inserted after a mid-pregnancy abortion than after an earlier one. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often.</P>
<P>Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical. However, the IUD is more likely to come out when inserted right away rather than at a later time. Women are more likely to use an IUD at six months if they had it inserted right away compared to some weeks after the abortion or miscarriage.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-02 15:51:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Babasola O Okusanya">
<P>The use of an effective contraceptive may be necessary after an abortion. Insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) may be done the same day or later. Immediate IUD insertion is an option since the woman is not pregnant, pain of insertion is less because the cervical os is open, and her motivation to use contraception may be high. However, insertion of an IUD immediately after a pregnancy ends carries risks, such as spontaneous expulsion.</P>

<P>To assess the safety and efficacy of IUD insertion immediately after spontaneous or induced abortion.</P>

<P>We evaluated the methodological quality of each report and abstracted the data. We focused on discontinuation rates for accidental pregnancy, perforation, expulsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. We computed the weighted average of the rate ratios.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-21 11:15:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 12 trials most of which are of moderate risk of bias involving 7,119 participants which described random assignment. Five trials randomised to either immediate or delayed insertion of IUD. One of them randomised to immediate versus delayed insertion of Copper 7 showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than was delayed insertion (RR 11.98, 95% CI 1.61 to 89.35,1 study, 259 participants); the quality of evidence was moderate. Moderate quality of evidence also suggests that use and expulsion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A was more likely for immediate compared to delayed insertion risk ratio (RR) 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.58; 3 studies; 878 participants) and RR 2.64 ( 95% CI 1.16 to 6.00; 3 studies; 878 participants) respectively. Another trial randomised to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T showed discontinuation rates due to pregnancy were likely to be higher for women in the Nova T group. (MD 8.70, 95% CI 3.92 to 13.48;1 study; 438 participants); moderate quality evidence.</P>
<P>Seven trials examined immediate insertion of IUD only. From meta-analysis of two multicentre trials, pregnancy was less likely for the TCu 220C versus the Lippes Loop (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75; 2 studies; 2257 participants ) as was expulsion (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81; 2 studies; 2257 participants). Estimates for the TCu 220 versus the Copper 7 were RR 0.42 ( 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77; 2 studies, 2,274 participants) and RR 0.68, (95% CI 0.51 to 0.91); 2 studies, 2,274 participants), respectively. In other work, adding copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop improved efficacy (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.28 to 9.04, 1 study, 400 participants) and reduced expulsion (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.97; 1 study, 400 participants).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:25:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abortion is the termination of pregnancy prior to viability. It could be due to a spontaneous miscarriage or be medically or surgically induced. Abortion and its complications are a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, especially, in low and middle income countries. </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:25:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The termination of pregnancy prior to viability could occur spontaneously. Spontaneous abortion is also known as spontaneous miscarriage. The true incidence of spontaneous abortion is unknown but 15% of clinically evident pregnancies and 60% of chemically diagnosed pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Uzelac-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uzelac 2007</LINK>). There are different classifications of abortion.</P>
<P>Threathened abortion occurs when there is uterine bleeding with or without lower abdominal pain and the cervical os is closed. In missed abortion, there is retention of the dead embryo or fetus prior to viability. It presents with slight uterine bleeding, regression of pregnancy symptoms and therefore mimics threatened abortion. However, ultrasonography would confirm a missed abortion when fetal heart activities are not demonstrated. Ineveitable abortion is diagnosed when there is dilatation of the cervix and intrauterine bleeding without expulsion of any products of conception (<LINK REF="REF-Uzelac-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uzelac 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Occassionally, spontaneous miscarriage could be incomplete. In these instances, uterine bleeding is usually associated with lower abdominal pains, the cervical os is open with partial expulsion of products of conception (<LINK REF="REF-Uzelac-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uzelac 2007</LINK>). It may be possible to see products of conception at the cervical os.Complete spontaneous miscarriage occurs when all the products of conception are expelled and the cervical os is closed. Due to the closed os, it may be difficult to diagnose but, ultrasonography may aid diagnosis.</P>
<P>Intentional termination of pregnancy is known as induced abortion. Induced abortion may be medical or surgical, and medications used to induce abortion include Mefipristone and Misoprostol. Surgically-induced abortion could be done with the manual vacuum or electric aspirator.</P>
<P>The cause of most cases of spontaneous abortion is unknown. However, abnormal karyotype account for about 50% of first trimester spontaneous abortions (<LINK REF="REF-Uzelac-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uzelac 2007</LINK>). Other causes of spontaneous abortion are infection, anatomic defects, endocrine factors, immunologic factors and maternal systemic diseases.</P>
<P>The impact abortion has on health systems depends on how liberal the legislation on abortion is. In settings with restrictive abortion laws, abortion takes a large toll on health systems due to the morbidity and mortality that complicate clandestine induced abortions. Abortion-related complications accounted for 5.4% of maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Okusanya-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okusanya 2013</LINK>) and 11.4% of severe maternal outcomes in the cluster of facilities involved in the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicountry Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Souza-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souza 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>By contrast, abortion is procured in health facilities of countries with liberal legislation on abortion. In the United States, 1.3 million women have abortions annually and half of these are repeat procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2008</LINK>). In these settings, family planning counselling and provision of contraceptive products such as the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) are offered to avert repeat, unintended pregnancies.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-01 22:53:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Babasola O Okusanya">
<P>Postabortion IUD insertion could be immediate or at an interval (otherwise known as delayed). When an IUD is inserted the same day after an induced abortion or complete spontaneous miscarriage, it is termed 'immediate IUD insertion'. Insertion of an IUD immediately after an abortion has several potential advantages. The woman is known not to be pregnant (a major concern for clinicians) and it avoids repeat unintended pregnancies despite return to sexual activity and of ovulation. For example, many clinicians refuse to insert an IUD in a woman who is not menstruating (<LINK REF="REF-Stanback-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 1997</LINK>). More so, after induced abortion, a woman's motivation to use contraception may be high, and for women who have limited access to a clinician, abortion care may provide a unique opportunity to address a woman's need for contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaurin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaurin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>). In addition, insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion may avoid discomfort related to insertion, and any bleeding from the insertion will be disguised by the expected bleeding after abortion. Less than a third of women who intend to have an IUD after abortion may actually have one inserted, and many prefer to have the option of immediate insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Stanek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanek 2009</LINK>). Interval postabortion IUD insertion allows time for the woman to come to terms with the loss of a wanted pregnancy after a spontaneous miscarriage and affords a woman who had an induced abortion the opportunity to be sure of her choice of contraceptive since a visit is required postabortion. However, observational studies have reported that 40% of clients do not return for insertion after opting for delayed IUD insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2008</LINK>), and that the additional visit was a barrier to delayed IUD insertion (<LINK REF="REF-McNicholas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNicholas 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Insertion of an IUD immediately after a pregnancy ends carries potential risks as well. There are concerns over expulsion of the IUD due to dilated cervix and risk of perforation may be increased due to softening of the myometrium. Another potential concern is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), particularly when postabortion IUD insertion is done after a clandestine or unsafe abortion which increases the risk of upper genital tract infection compared with interval insertion.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:25:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intrauterine contraceptive devices act locally on the endometrium causing inflammatory reaction. In addition, progestin-impregnated devices cause daily release of hormones into maternal circulation.</P>
<P>Copper-containing IUDs are thought to have spermicidal actions, and their effect on the endometrium interferes with normal development of ova or fertilization of ova. It also promotes phagocytosis of sperm cells and inhibits the movement of sperm cells from the vagina to the fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Burkman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkman 2007</LINK>). It is also thought that the inflammatory changes of the endometrium may prevent implantation of the embryo should fertilization occur.</P>
<P>Hormone-impregnated IUDs release the progestin into the maternal circulation daily. They act primarily by thickening the cervical mucus, thereby impeding the ascent of sperm cells and its migration. They also inhibit ovulation, especially following insertion when the woman's serum concentration is relatively high. For instance, levonorgestrel-20 (LNG-20) IUD causes anovulation in approximately 10-15% of cycles and changes the endometrium to reduce the likelihood of implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Burkman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkman 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the mechanism of action of IUDs is irrespective of whether insertion is immediate or delayed, immediate IUD insertion would afford the woman an opportunity to have an effective contraceptive method earlier, before resumption of sexual activities. This would prevent an unplanned pregnancy and the need for a repeat induced abortion, or space the interval between a spontaneous miscarriage and the next planned pregnancy.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-01 23:04:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Babasola O Okusanya">
<P>An effective contraceptive is required postabortion. The return of fertility after an abortion is good and 83% of women who had an abortion ovulate during the first menstrual cycle following the abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Saav-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saav 2012</LINK>), and ovulation may occur as early as eight to 10 days after an induced abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Saav-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saav 2012</LINK>). This, coupled with return to sexual activity by most women within two weeks of an induced abortion make the use of postabortion contraceptives necessary. A postabortion contraceptive method should be effective, long-lasting and convenient to use. The IUDs, being similar to sterilisation in terms of contraceptive efficacy meet these criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2008</LINK>), yet they are simpler, less expensive, and promptly reversible. </P>
<P>The early return of ovulation, the likelihood of the woman not returning for a delayed IUD insertion and return to sexual activities make the concept of immediate insertion of intrauterine contraceptive devices worthy of a systematic review to assess the evidence for its effectiveness over delayed insertion.</P>

<P>Most studies could not be aggregated into a meta-analysis due to having different interventions.We extracted the estimates of effects (MDs) and SE of the mean for some outcomes and calculated 95% CIs of the MDs using generic inverse variance. Where the SE was not reported, we calculated the SE using the P-values reported. We estimated the (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for most of the trials using the crude number of events for dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using a fixed-effect model. An example is the proportion of women with spontaneous expulsion. Fixed- and random-effects give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, as when a comparison includes only one study. The Peto OR can be used when a study arm has no events, e.g. pregnancy; the Peto OR does not require correction for zero events (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

The researchers did not disclose when or if they informed the 100 participants in Group A that they had a sham insertion. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Goldsmith-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Goldsmith 1972</LINK> randomised 584 women to receive either a Lippes Loop or a sham insertion. The design was double blind, and the blinding ended after 30 days of observation, when the women without contraception were provided an IUD. In an addendum to the published report, the researchers acknowledged that women in the sham insertion group "were exposed to a risk of pregnancy albeit an extremely small one." They reasoned that this "risk was more than justified." In both studies, women lost to follow-up may have incorrectly assumed they were using an IUD when they were not. We excluded both trials because of unethical research conduct.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Immediate versus delayed insertion</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gillett-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gillett 1980</LINK>, low quality evidence suggests that immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than was delayed insertion for three to five weeks. (RR 11.98.; 95% CI 1.61 to 89.35; 1 study; 259 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). No other significant differences emerged. However, 42% of women assigned to delayed insertion did not return for IUD insertion.</P>
<P>Three recent studies randomised women to immediate or delayed insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Bednarek-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bednarek 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cremer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cremer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hohmann-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hohmann 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hohmann-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hohmann 2012</LINK> used the LNG-IUS; <LINK REF="STD-Cremer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cremer 2011</LINK> used Cu T80A and <LINK REF="STD-Bednarek-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bednarek 2011</LINK> offered either LNG-IUS or Cu T380A (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). When the trials were combined in a meta-analysis, moderate level evidence showed that expulsion by six months was more likely for the group assigned to immediate insertion than delayed insertion (RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.00; 3 studies; 878 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). Also low quality evidence shows that use at six months was greater in the immediate insertion group compared to the delayed insertion group (RR 1.40; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.58; 3 studies; 878 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.3</LINK>). Although there was more than a three-fold increase in risk of pregnancy in the delayed group when compared to the group who had immediate IUD insertion; there was no statistical difference between the two (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; 3 studies; 878 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-011.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.4</LINK>). However, infection of the upper genital tract was similar for the groups assigned to immediate and delayed insertion of IUD (<LINK REF="CMP-011.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.5</LINK>), quality of evidence was moderate.</P>
<P>From the trial comparing the Nova T and levonorgestrel-releasing device (Luukkainen et al, 1987, see <LINK REF="STD-Pakarinen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pakarinen 2003</LINK>), two subgroup analyses were published, only <LINK REF="STD-Pakarinen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pakarinen 2003</LINK> met our inclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Pakarinen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pakarinen 2003</LINK> analysed 438 immediate postabortal insertions, with 305 women randomised to the LNG system (LNG-IUS) and 133 to the Nova T. Over five years of use, pregnancies were significantly less common with the LNG-IUS than with the Nova T;(MD 8.70, 95% CI 3.92 to 13.48; 1 study; 438 participants) the gross discontinuation rate was 0.8 versus 9.5 per 100 women (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). A moderate level of evidence suggests that five-year cumulative discontinuation rates for hormonal reasons were higher with the LNG-IUS (MD -12.00, 95% CI -20.39 to -3.61; 1 study; 438 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). Expulsion rate between the two IUDs was no different (MD 4.90, 95% CI -5.99 to 15.79; 1 study; 438 participants). The Nova T was reportedly associated with more total days of bleeding and episodes of bleeding (MD 8.30, 95% CI -2.03 to 18.63; 1 study; 438 participants). On the other hand, amenorrhoea was reported as more common with the LNG-IUS (MD -2.10, 95% CI -5.02 to 0.82; 1 study; 438 participants). There is however no statistically significant different between Nova T and LNG-IUS for the two outcomes respectively.</P>

The Lippes Loop and Copper 7 did not differ significantly. When data from both trials were combined, moderate level evidence suggests that accidental pregnancy was more likely amongst women assigned to Lippes loop than TCu 220C (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75, 2 studies, 2,269 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

Expulsions were also significantly less frequent with the TCu 220C than with either of the other two IUDs. The estimate for the TCu 200C compared to the Lippes Loop was RR 0.61, (95% CI 0.46 to 0.81; 2studies; 2269 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and compared to the Copper 7 it was RR 0.68, ( 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 2 studies; 2274 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Uterine perforations were uncommon; one woman in the TCu 220C group, two in the Copper 7 group, and one in the Lippes loop group respectively; these figures are not statistically different (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK> and; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK> ). Pelvic inflammatory disease was also rare with IUD use after both induced and spontaneous abortion. Eight women in the Copper 7 group had PID, three in the Lippes loop group and four in the TCu 220C group; this difference however is not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>;<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; and <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Furthermore, the WHO trials reported that IUDs inserted after second-trimester abortions had higher expulsion rates than did IUDs inserted after earlier abortions. In the trial of induced abortion (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983a</LINK>), this difference was statistically significant for all three IUDs. For example, after abortions at less than 13 weeks' gestation, the cumulative net probability of expulsion at 120 days was 1.9 for the TCu 220C, 4.8 for the Lippes Loop, and 4.5 for the Copper 7. The corresponding figures after abortions at 13 to 20 weeks' gestation were 19.5, 48.8, and 21.3, respectively. Although this trend was also evident after spontaneous abortion, not all of the differences reached statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983b</LINK>). Neither the type of induced abortion procedure (sharp versus suction curettage) nor the use of oxytocic drugs significantly influenced outcomes.</P>
<P>The Nova T offered less protection against pregnancy than did the MLCu 250 (<LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 1985</LINK>). The RR of a failure with the Nova T was 6.00 (95% CI 0.73 to 49.39, 1 study, 400 participants). compared with the MLCu 250 (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Other differences between these two IUDs were not significant either. The trial comparing the MLCu 250 and MLCu 375 (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1985</LINK>) found no significant differences between them.</P>
<P>In contrast, in <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1984</LINK>, the Nova T was superior to the Copper T 200 in contraceptive efficacy, (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.94, 1 study, 331 participants), quality of evidence was moderate. (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). Expulsions were also somewhat higher for the Nova T but it was not significantly different (RR 1.64; 95% CI 0.86 to 3.12, 1 study, 331 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>). No other important differences emerged between these two devices.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Randic-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Randic 1991</LINK> moderate quality of evidence also suggest that addition of copper sleeves significantly improved the efficacy of the Lippes Loop D (RR 3.40; 95% CI 1.28 to 9.04, 1 study, 400 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). This modification also significantly reduced the likelihood of expulsion or displacement (RR 3.00; 95% CI 1.51 to 5.97, 1 study, 400 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>). In contrast, addition of a hydrogel (<LINK REF="STD-Randic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Randic 1983</LINK>) to the surface of a spring coil IUD did not improve tolerance of this device (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:01:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several trials compared immediate and delayed insertion of the same IUD(s). Four randomised to the time of insertion. Meta-analysis of three recent trials showed expulsion to be more likely in the immediate insertion group than the delayed insertion group; the quality of evidence was moderate. Moderate level evidence shows that IUD use at six months was also greater in the immediate insertion group. An older RCT showed a non-significant difference in expulsion, with the immediate group having a slightly higher frequency than the delayed group. The high drop-out rate with delayed insertion underscores a major public health point: many women who desire an IUD do not return if the insertion is delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Stanek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanek 2009</LINK>). The increased risk of spontaneous expulsion with immediate postabortal insertion needs to be balanced against the high rate of loss to follow-up. While some women who were lost to follow-up may have adopted other contraceptive methods, an unknown proportion remained unprotected against unintended pregnancy. A fifth trial randomised to different IUDs, but a subanalysis examined immediate versus delayed insertion. Both the Nova T and the LNG-IUS had higher expulsion rates with postabortal insertion than with delayed insertion; this difference was also not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>RCTs comparing different IUDs found immediate postabortal insertion to be safe and effective. Perforations were rare with the devices studied, despite pregnancy-related changes in the myometrium. Postabortal IUD insertion appears to carry a perforation risk similar to that of interval insertions (<LINK REF="REF-Sivin-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivin 1981</LINK>). PID was also uncommon. Although populations may not be directly comparable, PID rates in these trials appear similar to those reported with interval insertions (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinei-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinei 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1998</LINK>). Pregnancy rates were low, although some significant differences emerged between devices. For example, the levonorgestrel-releasing device was significantly more effective than the Nova T.</P>
<P>The configuration of the IUD influenced the risk of spontaneous expulsion. IUDs shaped like the letter T fared better than did alternative IUDs, such as the Lippes Loop or Copper 7. However, evidence is inadequate to determine which currently available IUD is best for immediate postabortal insertion. Rates of expulsion were higher after second-trimester abortion than after earlier abortion. Based on this observation, the WHO researchers (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983a</LINK>) recommended against IUD insertion immediately after second-trimester abortion. This advice is likely inappropriate, given more recent evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Hohmann-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hohmann 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>While addition of copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop D improved the contraceptive efficacy of the device, this modification is not commercially available. The explanation for the benefit seen in terms of expulsions and displacements is unclear, although the researchers speculate that it may relate to an effect of copper on uterine motility. Further research with topical applications of hydrogel appears unwarranted.</P>

<P>Outcomes with interval or immediate IUD insertions may also be useful for comparison. In an international trial (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>), 3655 healthy parous women were randomly allocated to receive either a Multiload 375 or a TCu 380A. The gross cumulative discontinuation rates with the Multiload 375 at one year were 1.2% for pregnancy and 3.6% for expulsion; 89% were continuing with the device. At three years, these figures were 2.9%, 6.4%, and 78%, respectively. The corresponding figures for the TCu 380A at one year were 0.8% for pregnancy and 3.8% for expulsion; 88% were continuing with the device. At three years, these figures were 1.6%, 5.2%, and 78%, respectively. In a US study of immediate insertion, 256 women were contacted six weeks after insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Drey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drey 2009</LINK>). The study showed 7.4% discontinuation; 1.9% had expulsions and 2.7% had suspected PID. Women with immediate insertion after first trimester abortions had slightly lower rates than those with second trimester abortions.</P>
<P>Insertion of an IUD at the time of abortion has several benefits compared with later insertion. After an unintended pregnancy, a woman may be highly motivated to avoid a recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaurin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaurin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>). IUD insertion after abortion ensures effective contraception by the time ovulation resumes, and it eliminates the need for another visit for IUD insertion. Concerns about uterine perforation and PID, however, have limited postabortal IUD insertions. These concerns appear unwarranted.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:25:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate level evidence suggests that immediate insertion of an IUD after abortion is both safe and effective. This was true for both induced and reported 'spontaneous' abortions, many of which may have been induced under clandestine circumstances (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983b</LINK>). IUD use is higher at six months with immediate insertion than with delayed insertion, though expulsion of IUD at six months may also be higher for immediate insertion.</P>
<P>Guidelines and package labelling that argue against postabortal insertions lack a scientific foundation. With immediate postabortal insertions, contraceptive efficacy is high, and PID and perforations are rare. While the risk of spontaneous expulsion of an IUD appears to be greater in this setting than with interval insertions, this potential disadvantage may be outweighed by provision of highly effective contraception with one procedure. The one-month follow-up visit (after the next menses) may be especially important for identifying unsuspected complete or partial expulsions. IUD insertion immediately after second-trimester abortion carries a higher risk of spontaneous expulsion than insertion after first-trimester abortion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-12 12:25:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Newer data are available on immediate versus delayed insertion. Addition of full reports of three recent studies in this review has shown that expulsion of IUD is more likely after immediate insertion than delayed insertion of IUD. Two ongoing trials are also directly comparing the time of insertion. Those trials should help inform the field in the near future.</P>
<P>Many trials compared different IUDs for immediate postabortal insertion. Hence, these trials cannot address the comparative safety and efficacy of immediate insertion versus insertion at a later time. Also, many of the reports were of suboptimal quality, and communication with researchers was needed for supplementary information. Few reports had a sample size calculation, and several had little power to detect differences. Some IUDs reviewed here are no longer widely used.</P>

<P>The report provides no a priori hypothesis or sample size and power calculation. Given the high proportion of abortions after 12 weeks and that legal abortion is unavailable or inaccessible in several of these countries, many of these "spontaneous" abortions were likely induced, possibly by unsafe methods. Thus, the risk of infection may be increased in this population. Non-medical and other reasons for discontinuation (such a desire for pregnancy) are not included in this review. No subjects who had an expulsion or removal of the device were readmitted to the study, thus analysis was based on first-segment event rates.</P>
