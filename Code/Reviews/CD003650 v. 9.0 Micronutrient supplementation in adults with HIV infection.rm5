<P>Cochrane researchers conducted a review of the effects of micronutrient supplements for people living with HIV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010. After searching for relevant trials up to 18 November 2016, the review authors included 33 trials. Thirteen of these trials included people not on HIV treatment and were conducted in Thailand, Peru, and eight African countries. Nineteen trials included people on HIV treatment and were conducted in North America, Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Thailand, Botswana, and Uganda. One trial from China did not state whether people living with HIV were on treatment or not. Some trials looked at the effects of taking supplements with multiple micronutrients whereas others looked at supplementation with single vitamins or minerals.</P>
<P>
<B>What are micronutrient supplements and how might they help people living with HIV?</B>
</P>
<P>Micronutrient supplements contain vitamins or minerals, or both, that are essential to good health. Many of these vitamins play important roles in maintaining the human immune system, which helps to fight off infections.</P>
<P>Infection with HIV causes a progressive destruction of the immune system, which leaves people vulnerable to frequent infections. Many people living with HIV, especially in low-income countries, are also undernourished and many consume diets deficient that these essential micronutrients. Supplementation could therefore help people living with HIV to stay healthy for longer by strengthening their immune system or assisting recovery from infections.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple micronutrients</I>
</P>
<P>Providing a daily supplement that contains multiple vitamins and minerals may have little or no effect on reducing deaths in people living with HIV, whether they are taking antiretroviral drugs or not (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). Daily supplements may have little or no effect on HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count (<I>low certainty evidence</I>) or HIV viral load (<I>low or moderate certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Single or dual micronutrients</I>
</P>
<P>We do not know whether supplements that contain single vitamins or minerals reduce deaths (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>) or slow disease progression (<I>very low/low certainty evidence</I>) in people living with HIV. Supplementation with vitamin A, D, zinc, or selenium may improve the level of each vitamin in a person's blood, especially those with low levels before supplementation (<I>low/moderate certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>These findings do not mean that an adequate dietary intake for people living with HIV is not important. It is also not a reason to deny micronutrient supplements for those in whom a deficiency has been clinically demonstrated, or who are unlikely to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:13:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Micronutrient deficiencies are common among adults living with HIV disease, particularly in low-income settings where the diet may be low in essential vitamins and minerals. Some micronutrients play critical roles in maintenance of the immune system, and routine supplementation could therefore be beneficial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-02 10:15:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess whether micronutrient supplements are effective and safe in reducing mortality and HIV-related morbidity of HIV-positive adults (excluding pregnant women).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-01 13:31:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed literature searches from January 2010 to 18 November 2016 for new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of micronutrient supplements since the previous review included all trials identified from searches prior to 2010. We searched the CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), Embase, and PubMed databases. Also we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of all new included trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-02-16 09:38:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included RCTs that compared supplements that contained either single, dual, or multiple micronutrients with placebo, no treatment, or other supplements. We excluded studies that were primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of HIV-positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity, and disease progression.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-02-16 09:38:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and appraised trial quality for risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, as hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event data, and as mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Since we were often unable to pool the outcome data, we tabulated it for each comparison. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-20 10:16:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 trials with 10,325 participants, of which 17 trials were new trials. Ten trials compared a daily multiple micronutrient supplement to placebo in doses up to 20 times the dietary reference intake, and one trial compared a daily standard dose with a high daily dose of multivitamins. Nineteen trials compared supplementation with single or dual micronutrients (such as vitamins A and D, zinc, and selenium) to placebo, and three trials compared different dosages or combinations of micronutrients.</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple micronutrients</I>
</P>
<P>We conducted analyses across antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults (3 trials, 1448 participants), adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (1 trial, 400 participants), and ART-naive adults with concurrent active tuberculosis (3 trials, 1429 participants). Routine multiple micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in adults living with HIV (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15; 7 trials, 2897 participants, <I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Routine supplementation for up to two years may have little or no effect on the average of mean CD4+ cell count (MD 26.40 cells/mm³, 95% CI &#8722;22.91 to 75.70; 6 trials, 1581 participants, <I>low certainty evidence</I>), or the average of mean viral load (MD &#8722;0.1 log<SUB>10</SUB>viral copies, 95% CI &#8722;0.26 to 0.06; 4 trials, 840 participants, <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>). One additional trial in ART-naïve adults did report an increase in the time to reach a CD4+ cell count &lt; 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation in Botswana (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.88; 1 trial, 439 participants). However, the trial authors reported this effect only in the trial arm that received multiple micronutrients plus selenium (not either supplementation alone), which is inconsistent with the findings of other trials that used similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium.</P>
<P>In one additional trial that compared high-dose multiple micronutrient supplementation with standard doses in people on ART, peripheral neuropathy was lower with high dose supplements compared to standard dose (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.94; 1 trial, 3418 participants), but the trial was stopped early due to increased adverse events (elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels) in the high dose group.</P>
<P>
<I>Single or dual micronutrients</I>
</P>
<P>None of the trials of single or dual micronutrient supplements were adequately powered to assess for effects on mortality or morbidity outcomes. No clinically significant changes in CD4 cell count (data not pooled, 14 trials, 2370 participants, <I>very low or</I> <I>low certainty evidence</I>) or viral load (data not pooled, seven studies, 1334 participants, <I>very low or</I> <I>low certainty evidence</I>), were reported. Supplementation probably does increase blood concentrations of vitamin D and zinc (data not pooled, vitamin D: 4 trials, 299 participants, zinc: 4 trials, 484 participants, <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>) and may also increase blood concentrations of vitamin A (data not pooled, 3 trials, 495 participants, <I>low certainty evidence</I>), especially in those who are deficient.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-03 10:26:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analyses of the available trials have not revealed consistent clinically important benefits with routine multiple micronutrient supplementation in people living with HIV. Larger trials might reveal small but important effects.</P>
<P>These findings should not be interpreted as a reason to deny micronutrient supplements for people living with HIV where specific deficiencies are found or where the person's diet is insufficient to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-21 08:58:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite a substantial decrease in the number of new HIV infections during the past decade, recent estimates from the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) indicate that 35 million people were still living with HIV worldwide in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2014</LINK>). The HIV/AIDS pandemic has severely affected sub-Saharan Africa, more than any other part of the world. With about a tenth of the world's population, the region is home to more than two-thirds of all people living with HIV worldwide, an estimated 24.7 million adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2014</LINK>). Globally, more than one-third of HIV-positive adults receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2014</LINK>). Earlier initiation of ART, in line with recent recommendations, is a challenge to implement in many countries, especially those in resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adults living with HIV may also have micronutrient deficiencies, particularly those from communities at high risk of food insecurity since diets are frequently inadequate to meet the recommended daily requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Gebrehiwot-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gebrehiwot 2014</LINK>). A recent review reported that people living with HIV who experience food insecurity tended to have lower CD4 counts than their counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-Aibibula-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aibibula 2016</LINK>). Deficiencies of micronutrients are more pronounced in individuals with advanced disease, as a consequence of reduced nutrient intake due to AIDS and opportunistic infections, and excessive losses due to diarrhoea, malabsorption, and parasitic infections. Furthermore, in sub-Saharan Africa, a region severely affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is common. PEM refers to inadequate protein and energy intake and is usually associated with multiple micronutrient insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-17 09:22:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Micronutrient supplements are either single or multiple formulations of vitamins and trace elements. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:10:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Micronutrients play a critical role in the maintenance of a functional immune system. The interactions between micronutrients and the components of the immune response are multifaceted and complex <LINK REF="REF-Chandra-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raiten-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiten 2015</LINK>). Several observational studies have suggested that micronutrient deficiencies may hasten clinical disease progression in HIV-positive adults. Low blood levels of vitamin A, B12, zinc, and selenium have been related to increased HIV progression (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupka-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupka 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1997</LINK>) or death in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baum-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semba-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1993</LINK>). Most participants in these earlier studies were not receiving ART at the time. More recently, vitamin D deficiency, which is assessed by low 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, has been associated with increased disease progression of untreated (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2010</LINK>) or treated HIV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sudfeld-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudfeld 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viard 2011</LINK>), and impaired CD4 cell count recovery of HIV-positive men and women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (<LINK REF="REF-Aziz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Widespread micronutrient supplementation may lessen the effects of concurrent micronutrient deficiency and help to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Semba-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 1999</LINK>). It has also been suggested that micronutrient supplementation may enhance the CD4 cell responses of individuals on ART who demonstrate adequate viral suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessing the effectiveness of micronutrient supplementation in participants with inflammation requires special consideration. Acute inflammation results in the redistribution of micronutrients due to changes in plasma proteins and may therefore impact on the validity of nutrient biomarkers, such as serum micronutrient concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Raiten-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiten 2015</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-01 12:41:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous version of this Cochrane review included 30 trials: 20 trials of single micronutrient supplements (vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc, and selenium) and 10 of multiple micronutrient supplements. Eight trials were undertaken in child populations and four trials were conducted among pregnant and lactating women (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK>). The review found no conclusive evidence that micronutrient supplementation effectively reduces or increases morbidity or mortality in HIV-positive adults.</P>
<P>The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a major impact on global health, nutrition, and overall socioeconomic development. An update of the review based on recent, valid research is therefore important. Micronutrient supplements have potential benefit for people living with HIV infection. However, in order to understand the magnitude of this benefit and how supplements should be positioned alongside the proven advantages of antiretroviral drugs, a robust evidence-base to guide policy and practice is required.</P>
<P>At the request of the World Health Organization (WHO), two separate Cochrane Reviews on the role of micronutrient supplementation were published for HIV-positive pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 2012</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2013</LINK>). The primary focus of this Cochrane review is therefore on the role of micronutrient supplementation in HIV-positive non-pregnant adults.</P>

Since the objective of this Cochrane Review is on the adjunctive role of micronutrients on mortality and HIV-related morbidity, we excluded studies that were primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of HIV-positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to ART. A Cochrane review on treatment for dyslipidaemia in HIV infection is in progress (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed__x002d_Carvajal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martí-Carvajal 2010</LINK>).</P>

A positive result in an underpowered study is not likely to reflect a true result (low positive predictive value (PPV)) and the magnitude of the effect estimate may also be exaggerated (<LINK REF="REF-Button-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Button 2013</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Multiple micronutrients</HEADING>
<P>Routine multiple micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in adults living with HIV, but the pooled analysis remains underpowered to confidently exclude small effects (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). Trials were conducted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve adults (3 trials, 1068 participants, <I>low certainty evidence</I>), adults on ART (1 trial, 400 participants, <I>very low certainty evidence</I>), and adults with concurrent active tuberculosis (3 trials, 1429 participants, <I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Routine supplementation for up to two years, has also not been shown to have consistent benefits on either mean CD4+ cell count (<I>low certainty evidence</I>) or mean viral load (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>). One recent trial in ART-naïve adults reported a reduction in the risk of reaching a CD4+ cell count of less than 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation in Botswana. However, this effect was only robust in the trial arm receiving multiple micronutrients plus selenium (not either supplementation alone) and is inconsistent with the findings of other trials using similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium.</P>
<P>In one additional trial that compared high dose multiple micronutrient supplementation with standard doses in people on antiretroviral therapy (ART), peripheral neuropathy was reduced with high dose supplements compared to standard dose, but the trial was stopped early due to increased adverse events in the high dose group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Single or dual micronutrients</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials of single or dual micronutrient supplements were adequately powered to assess for effects on mortality or morbidity outcomes such as hospital admissions and persistence or rate of diarrhoea. Clinically important effects on CD4+ cell count or viral load were not reported. Supplementation probably does increase blood concentrations of vitamin D and zinc, and may also increase blood concentrations of vitamin A, especially in those who are deficient at baseline.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-15 11:12:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials of multiple micronutrient supplements were predominantly conducted in people who either were not taking ART or were on concurrent treatment for tuberculosis. In these populations, routine supplementation has not been shown to consistently improve disease progression as measured by average CD4+ cell count. One recent well-conducted trial, from Botswana detected a benefit in the group receiving multivitamins with selenium but not with multivitamins alone. However, the lack of demonstrable benefit in other trials with similar selenium content, suggest that this effect should be repeated before reliable conclusions can be drawn.</P>
<P>The trials of single or dual micronutrient supplements included more participants on ART, and several were conducted in populations with proven micronutrient deficiencies. Despite this the only demonstrable benefits were improvements in serum levels of some micronutrients. However, these effects may be enough for some to recommend routine supplementation in similar populations.</P>
<P>There are several possible explanations for the lack of benefit seen in many of these trials.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The period of supplementation may have been insufficient to demonstrate effects, with benefits only accruing over prolonged periods of supplementation. Supplementation ranged from as little as four weeks up to two years.</LI>
<LI>The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies may have been too low in some of these populations to demonstrate an effect. Baseline micronutrient status was poorly assessed in many of the included trials, particularly those evaluating multiple micronutrients, so it is difficult to determine which populations these negative results should be applied to. Only one trial reported adjustment of their analysis of blood micronutrient concentrations for the effect of inflammation, an important confounder.</LI>
<LI>The doses supplemented varied considerably. Many trials evaluated doses significantly higher than the daily recommended intake, and one trial of multiple micronutrients directly compared high doses with standard doses to investigate this. However, it should be noted that the high doses were not well-tolerated in this trial.</LI>
<LI>The trials may simply be too small to demonstrate effects. Certainly there is insufficient evidence to say that micronutrients could never have effects.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Given the lack of benefit in those not on ART, it seems unlikely that large effects would be seen in those who are taking ART, but adequately powered trials may still be justifiable to explore this. There may be a number of ways by which specific micronutrients may impact on or interact with ART, including aspects of drug pharmacokinetics. However, the clinical significance of these interactions remains to be determined (<LINK REF="REF-Raiten-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiten 2011</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-15 11:12:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered the certainty of the evidence for most of the outcomes in this review to be low or very low, meaning that we can have only minimal confidence in these effects. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly for the following reasons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Indirectness: since micronutrient deficiencies differ widely among populations it is difficult to generalize the findings of a single trial, or even a few trials, to all settings, and all populations.</LI>
<LI>Imprecision: most included trials were small and well below the optimal information size for the outcomes that were being measured and therefore not able to reliably detect or exclude an effect.</LI>

<P>In the previous version of this Cochrane Review, <LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2010</LINK> concluded that further trials of single supplements (vitamin D, zinc, and selenium) were required to build the evidence base for adults and that the long-term clinical benefits, adverse effects, and optimal formulation of multiple micronutrient supplements required further investigation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Forrester-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrester 2011</LINK> conducted a narrative review to investigate whether the 2003 WHO recommendations for micronutrient intake in HIV-positive adults should change. This review focused primarily on the results of nine trials of multiple micronutrient supplementation; seven trials in non-pregnant HIV-positive adults, and two in pregnant HIV-positive women. The authors noted that "five of the six trials that used high-dose multiple micronutrients showed benefits in terms of either improved CD4 cell counts or survival", but also that "many of these trials were small and of short duration, and the long-term risks and benefits of high-dose multiple micronutrients are not established". Our analysis and appraisal of the evidence agrees that there is currently insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions about the effects of supplementation.</P>

<P>Furthermore, adequately powered studies with sufficient follow-up periods are still required to confidently prove or exclude any long-term clinical benefit of routine supplementation.</P>

<P>Preliminary data analysis after 1 year after the start of the trial (November 2008) indicated an increased mortality risk with high-dose supplementation.

<P>These participants were subsequently excluded from enrolment and those who had been enrolled received standard dose supplementation. Since 612 participants enrolled in this period did not fulfil the eligibility criteria of the trial protocol, the sample size was increased.</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>No serious risk of bias: most trials were at low risk of selection bias and used placebos to prevent performance or detection bias.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious heterogeneity: none of the trials found statistically significant effects overall (although one small subgroup from one trial in Tanzania did find a statistically significant difference this is probably a chance finding).<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: although most trials reported this outcome, only one of these (from Uganda using standard dose micronutrients) included a substantial number of adults on ART in line with current recommendations. The other trials used standard or high dose micronutrients and were conducted in ART-naive adults (in Botswana, Zambia, and Thailand), and adults with concurrent tuberculosis (in Tanzania and Malawi).<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious imprecision: the 95% CI is wide and includes both clinically important effects and no effect. The overall meta-analysis remains underpowered to confidently exclude effects.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for very serious indirectness: these two trials were conducted in Thailand (high dose micronutrients in ART-naive adults) and Uganda (standard dose micronutrients in adults on ART). The finding of no effect may not apply to all populations and settings.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: in total eight trials reported a measure of CD4+ cell count although we could only include six trials in this meta-analysis. Of note, one recent trial in Botswana among ART-naive adults (not included in the meta-analysis) reported a reduced risk of reaching a CD4+ cell count of less than 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation. This finding is inconsistent with other trials that used similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: in total four trials in ART-naive adults, with concurrent TB (in Tanzania and Malawi) or without TB (in Kenia and Thailand), reported viral load. The finding of no effect may not apply to people on ART or other populations and settings.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for serious indirectness: only three trials (from Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania) reported measures of nutritional status (BMI, weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), lean body mass). The finding of no effect may not apply to all populations and settings.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious imprecision: we were unable to pool data but the 95% CIs of the individual trials were wide and included clinically important effects and no effect.<BR/>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>No serious risk of bias: all trials were at low risk of selection bias. Appropriate methods of blinding were used.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious heterogeneity: none of the trials found statistically significant effects.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: the three trials were conducted in Botswana (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2013-BWA" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2013 BWA</LINK>), Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2008-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2008 ZMB</LINK>) and Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Jiamton-2003-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Jiamton 2003 THA</LINK>).The finding of no effect may not apply to all populations.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious imprecision: the 95% CI is wide and includes both clinically important effects and no effect. The overall meta-analysis is substantially underpowered to confidently exclude effects.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for very serious indirectness: only a single trial is available from Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Jiamton-2003-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Jiamton 2003 THA</LINK>). The finding of no effect is not easily generalized to other settings.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: One trial in Botswana among ART-naive adults (not included in the meta-analysis) reported a reduced risk of reaching a CD4+ cell count of less than 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation. This finding is inconsistent with other trials that used similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: these two trials both used high-dose multiple micronutrients and were conducted in Kenya (with 6 weeks follow-up) and Zambia (with 1.9 years follow-up). TThe finding of no effect may not apply to people on ART or other populations and settings.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: these two studies both used high dose multiple micronutrients and were conducted in Kenya (with 6 weeks follow-up) and Thailand (with 48 weeks follow-up). The finding of no effect may not apply to people on ART or other populations and settings.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for very serious indirectness: only a single trial from Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2008-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2008 ZMB</LINK>) reports measures of nutritional status. This does not exclude the possibility of effects in some populations.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for serious imprecision: this trial is underpowered to detect or exclude clinically important differences. The trial reported no difference in BMI, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), lean body mass or fat mass but did not present data.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Domain 1: recruitment bias</HEADING>
<P>Recruitment bias can occur when individuals are recruited to the trial after the clusters have been randomized (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The types of participants recruited can be influenced by the knowledge of whether the specific cluster is an intervention or a control cluster.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate: when no recruiting was done after randomization.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate: when additional recruiting was done after randomization.</LI>
<LI>Unclear: when no reporting was done regarding the timing of recruiting all participants.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Domain 2: baseline imbalance</HEADING>
<P>Cluster-randomized trials often randomize all clusters at once, therefore, a lack of allocation concealment should not usually be a problem (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). However, when there is only a small number of clusters, there is a possibility of chance baseline imbalances between the randomized groups. This may affect either the clusters or the individuals.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate: when the baseline comparability of clusters is sufficient, or when statistical adjustment for baseline characteristics occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Inadequate: when there are significant differences between clusters and no statistical adjustments for baseline characteristics were made accordingly.</LI>
<LI>Unclear: when no reporting was done regarding baseline characteristics, or when it is not clear whether the differences between the clusters were significant.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Domain 3: loss of clusters</HEADING>
<P>It is possible that complete clusters may be lost from a trial, and have to be omitted from the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In the same way as for missing outcome data in individually randomized trials, this may lead to bias in cluster-randomized trials. In addition, missing outcomes for individuals within clusters may also lead to a risk of bias in cluster-randomized trials.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate: there were no missing data, or the missing data were addressed in the correct manner.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate: there were missing data and it was dealt with in a way that could have introduced bias.</LI>
<LI>Unclear: when no reporting was done regarding missing data (either complete clusters or individuals within clusters), or when it is unclear whether the authors of the primary study have dealt with the missing data adequately (for example, acceptable statistical adjustments).</LI>
