<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The review substantially updates the <LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2006</LINK> review due to new Cochrane guidelines for inclusion and exclusion of studies and the need for the review to be standardised with the repeat courses of prenatal corticosteroids review. Six new trials have been included (<LINK REF="STD-Amorim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Amorim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dexiprom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dexiprom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fekih-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fekih 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2001</LINK>). Three studies that were included in the previous review have been excluded. The results are now presented as relative risks. Results from recent follow-up studies have been included. Individual participant data were available from the Liggins and Howie study and these were analysed completely by intention-to-treat analysis for the first time. These data contribute nearly a third of the data to the review. This represents an important development. The review also provides new information on corticosteroid use in the presence of rupture of membranes, hypertension syndromes, in multiple pregnancies and according to gestational age at first corticosteroid dose.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Babies born very early, or very preterm, are at risk of having breathing difficulties and other serious health problems at birth, as a child and later in life. Some babies born very early do not survive these difficulties. Some babies have health problems that prevent them from developing as they should and can lead to problems with movement or learning. Corticosteroids are medicines given to women in early labour to help the babies' lungs to mature more quickly and so reduce the number of babies who die or suffer breathing problems at birth.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Breathing problems are the main cause of death and serious health problems for babies born very early. Pregnant women who have ruptured membranes or spontaneous preterm labour can take corticosteroids to help mature the baby's lungs. In this review, we compared women and babies who had these medicines to women and babies who did not.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (17 February 2016).</P>
<P>We looked at 30 trials where corticosteroids were given to women at risk of preterm birth (7774 women and 8158 infants). The trials were all carried out in hospitals in high-income countries. Our review shows that a single course of a corticosteroids, given to the mother in preterm labour and before the baby is born, helps to develop the baby's lungs and reduces complications such as breathing problems. Furthermore, this treatment results in fewer babies dying at birth, and fewer babies having other serious health problems that commonly affect babies born very early (such as bleeding in the brain or damage to the baby's intestines).</P>
<P>For the mother, having a single course of corticosteroids did not appear to impact on the number of women who had infections of the womb (chorioamnionitis or endometritis). There were too few data available to fully assess the outcome of maternal death.</P>
<P>The quality of the trial evidence was moderate, which means that we can be reasonably confident that future studies of corticosteroids in similar hospital settings will come to the same conclusions about the benefits and safety of treatment for women and babies.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Most pregnant women who are at risk of giving birth very early or very preterm will benefit from having a corticosteroid medicine. These medicines appear to be safe for pregnant women and babies when given in hospital settings in high-income countries, and they improve the chance that the preterm baby will survive and avoid immediate health problems. We have less information about the impact of steroids on women with multiple pregnancy and on women with other problems during pregnancy such as high blood pressure or ruptured membranes. We are uncertain whether a specific steroid or dosage is best for women and babies.</P>
<P>Evidence in this review comes from high-income countries and hospital settings; therefore, the results may not be applicable to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-09 13:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nancy  Medley">
<P>Respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal mortality and disability. While researching the effects of the steroid dexamethasone on premature parturition in fetal sheep in 1969, Liggins found that there was some inflation of the lungs of lambs born at gestations at which the lungs would be expected to be airless. Liggins and Howie published the first randomised controlled trial in humans in 1972 and many others followed. </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-02-14 12:56:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered all randomised controlled comparisons of antenatal corticosteroid administration (betamethasone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) with placebo, or with no treatment, given to women with a singleton or multiple pregnancy, prior to anticipated preterm delivery (elective, or following spontaneous labour), regardless of other co-morbidity, for inclusion in this review. Most women in this review received a single course of steroids; however, nine of the included trials allowed for women to have weekly repeats.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 13:35:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update includes 30 studies (7774 women and 8158 infants). Most studies are of low or unclear risk for most bias domains. An assessment of high risk usually meant a trial had potential for performance bias due to lack of blinding. Two trials had low risks of bias for all risk of bias domains.</P>
<P>Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids (compared with placebo or no treatment) is associated with a reduction in the most serious adverse outcomes related to prematurity, including: <B>perinatal death</B> (average risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.89; participants = 6729; studies = 15; Tau² = 0.05, I² = 34%; moderate-quality); <B>neonatal death</B> (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; participants = 7188; studies = 22), <B>RDS</B> (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.77; participants = 7764; studies = 28; Tau² = 0.06, I² = 48%; moderate-quality); <B>moderate/severe RDS</B> (average RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.91; participants = 1686; studies = 6; Tau² = 0.14, I² = 52%); <B>intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)</B> (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76; participants = 6093; studies = 16; Tau² = 0.10, I² = 33%; moderate-quality), <B>necrotising enterocolitis</B> (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.78; participants = 4702; studies = 10); <B>need for mechanical ventilation</B> (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.84; participants = 1368; studies = 9); and <B>systemic infections in the first 48 hours of life</B> (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; participants = 1753; studies = 8).</P>
<P>There was no obvious benefit for: <B>chronic lung disease</B> (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.79; participants = 818; studies = 6; Tau² = 0.38 I² = 65%); <B>mean birthweight</B> (g) (MD -18.47, 95% CI -40.83 to 3.90; participants = 6182; studies = 16; moderate-quality); <B>death in childhood</B> (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.27; participants = 1010; studies = 4); <B>neurodevelopment delay in childhood</B> (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.98; participants = 82; studies = 1); or <B>death into adulthood</B> (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.81; participants = 988; studies = 1).</P>
<P>Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids does not increase the risk of <B>chorioamnionitis</B> (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; participants = 5546; studies = 15; moderate-quality evidence) or <B>endometritis</B> (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; participants = 4030; studies = 10; Tau² = 0.11, I² = 28%; moderate-quality). No increased risk in <B>maternal death </B>was observed. However, the data on maternal death is based on data from a single trial with two deaths; four other trials reporting maternal death had zero events (participants = 3392; studies = 5; moderate-quality). </P>
<P>There is no definitive evidence to suggest that antenatal corticosteroids work differently in any pre-specified subgroups (singleton versus multiple pregnancy; membrane status; presence of hypertension) or for different study protocols (type of corticosteroid; single course or weekly repeats).</P>
<P>GRADE outcomes were downgraded to moderate-quality. Downgrading decisions (for perinatal death, RDS, IVH, and mean birthweight) were due to limitations in study design or concerns regarding precision (chorioamnionitis, endometritis). Maternal death was downgraded for imprecision due to few events.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 13:06:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from this update supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery. It is important to note that most of the evidence comes from high income countries and hospital settings; therefore, the results may not be applicable to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.</P>
<P>There is little need for further trials of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids versus placebo in singleton pregnancies in higher income countries and hospital settings. However, data are sparse in lower income settings. There are also few data regarding risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroids in multiple pregnancies and other high-risk obstetric groups. Further information is also required concerning the optimal dose-to-delivery interval, and the optimal corticosteroid to use.</P>
<P>We encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information, which may answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids in such pregnancies without the need for further randomised controlled trials. Individual patient data meta-analysis from published trials is likely to answer some of the evidence gaps. Follow-up studies into childhood and adulthood, particularly in the late preterm gestation and repeat courses groups, are needed. We have not examined the possible harmful effects of antenatal corticosteroids in low-resource settings in this review. It would be particularly relevant to explore this finding in adequately powered prospective trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-09 08:27:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal death and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2002</LINK>). It affects up to half of babies born before 28 weeks and a third of babies born before 32 weeks. Approximately 42% of extremely low birthweight babies have RDS (less than 1500 g) (<LINK REF="REF-Hintz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hintz 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Respiratory failure in these infants occurs as a result of surfactant deficiency, poor lung anatomical development and immaturity in other organs. Neonatal survival after preterm birth improves with gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2001a</LINK>), reflecting improved maturity of organ systems. However, those who survive early neonatal care are at increased risk of long-term neurological disability (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some understanding of fetal lung development may be useful in understanding why RDS occurs and why corticosteroids work. Fetal lung development can be divided into five stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, terminal sac and alveolar. The lung first appears as an outgrowth of the primitive foregut at 22 to 26 days after conception. By 34 days, the outgrowth has divided into left and right sides and further to form the major units of the lung. Mature lungs contain more than 40 different cell types derived from this early tissue. From eight to 16 weeks' gestation, the major bronchial airways and associated respiratory units of the lung are progressively formed. At this time the lung blood vessels also begin to grow in parallel. From 17 to 25 weeks' gestation, the airways grow, widen and lengthen (canalisation). Terminal bronchioles with enlargements that subsequently give rise to terminal sacs (the primitive alveoli) are formed. These are the functional units of the lung (respiratory lobules). It is at this stage that the increasing proximity of blood capillaries begins the air-blood interface, required for effective air exchange. This can only take place at the terminal bronchioles. At the end of the canalicular stage, type I and II pneumocytes can be seen in the alveoli. From 28 to 35 weeks' gestation, the alveoli can be counted and with increasing age they become more mature. Lung volume increases four-fold between 29 weeks and term. Alveolar number shows a curvilinear increase with age but a linear relationship with bodyweight. At birth there are an average of 150 million alveoli (half the expected adult number). The alveoli produce surfactant. The alveolar stage continues for one to two years after birth. In the preterm infant, low alveolar numbers probably contribute to respiratory dysfunction.</P>
<P>The fetal lung also matures biochemically with increasing gestation. Lamellar bodies, which store surfactant, appear at 22 to 24 weeks. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and apoproteins, the main constituents of which are dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline, phosphatidylglycerol and apoproteins A, B, C and D. Surfactant is needed to maintain stability when breathing out, to prevent collapse of the alveoli. Premature infants have a qualitative and quantitative deficiency of surfactant, which predisposes to RDS. At the low lung volume associated with expiration, surface tension becomes very high, leading to atelectasis with subsequent intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation perfusion inequalities, and ultimately respiratory failure. Capillary leakage allows inhibitors from plasma to reach alveoli and inactivate any surfactant that may be present. Hypoxia, acidosis and hypothermia (common problems in the very preterm infant) can reduce surfactant synthesis required to replenish surfactant lost from the system. The pulmonary antioxidant system develops in parallel to the surfactant system and deficiency in this also puts the preterm infant at risk of chronic lung disease.</P>

Liggins and Howie performed the first randomised controlled trial in humans of betamethasone for the prevention of RDS in 1972 (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several clinical trials have been performed on the effects of corticosteroids before preterm birth since the original Liggins study. The first structured review on corticosteroids in preterm birth was published in 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 1990</LINK>). This review showed that corticosteroids given prior to preterm birth (as a result of either preterm labour or planned preterm delivery) are effective in preventing RDS and neonatal mortality. Corticosteroid treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). Corticosteroids appear to exert major vasoconstrictive effects on fetal cerebral blood flow, protecting the fetus against IVH at rest and when challenged by conditions causing vasodilatation such as hypercapnia (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 2000</LINK>). Crowley found no effect on necrotising enterocolitis or chronic lung disease from antenatal corticosteroid administration. The influence of the results of the original trial and Crowley's review was the subject of a Wellcome Witness Seminar (<LINK REF="REF-Wellcome-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellcome 2005</LINK>) held in 2004.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids have become the mainstay of prophylactic treatment in preterm birth, as a result of these findings and subsequent work. However, there have remained a number of outstanding issues regarding the use of antenatal corticosteroids. The original trial by Liggins suggested an increased rate of stillbirth in women with hypertension syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1976</LINK>). There is concern about using corticosteroids in women with premature rupture of membranes due to the possible increased risk of neonatal and maternal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Imseis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imseis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1994</LINK>). The efficacy of this treatment in multiple births has only been addressed retrospectively (<LINK REF="REF-Turrentine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turrentine 1996</LINK>). From the time of the original Liggins paper, debate has continued around whether the treatment is effective at lower gestations and at differing treatment-to-delivery intervals. Recently, debate has also centred around whether treatment is effective at latter gestations, up to and including term delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Sotiriadis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sotiriadis 2009</LINK>). These issues will be addressed in this review in subgroup analyses. The effectiveness and safety of repeat doses of corticosteroids for women who remain undelivered, but at increased risk of preterm birth after an initial course of treatment, is addressed in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent epidemiological evidence and animal work suggests that there may be adverse long-term consequences of antenatal exposure to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Seckl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seckl 2000</LINK>). Exposure to excess corticosteroids before birth is hypothesised to be a key mechanism underlying the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benediktsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benediktsson 1993</LINK>). This hypothesis postulates a link between impaired fetal growth, and cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in later life along with their risk factors of impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1998</LINK>). A large body of animal experimental work has documented impaired glucose tolerance and increased blood pressure in adult animals after antenatal exposure to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodic 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2001</LINK>). Thus, this review has considered blood pressure, glucose intolerance, dyslipidaemia, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function in childhood and adulthood.</P>
<P>Experimental animal studies have also shown decreased brain growth in preterm and term infants exposed to single courses of corticosteroid (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1998</LINK>). This review has therefore also addressed long-term neurodevelopment and other childhood and adult outcomes after antenatal corticosteroid exposure.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972a</LINK> theorised that dexamethasone might have accelerated the appearance of pulmonary surfactant. The hypothesis is that corticosteroids act to trigger the synthesis of ribonucleic acid that codes for particular proteins involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids or in the breakdown of glycogen. Subsequent work has suggested that, in animal models, corticosteroids mature a number of organ systems (<LINK REF="REF-Padbury-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padbury 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vyas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vyas 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-07 12:25:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was a need for an updated systematic review of the effects of prophylactic corticosteroids for preterm birth, as a result of current interest and due to further published trials. In the previous review we were able to re-analyse the Auckland Steroid Study by intention-to-treat. This study contributes 15% of the participants to the review so this was an important development for the review. This update is needed because it has been some time since the previous version was published, review methodology for Cochrane Reviews has changed, and we attempted to standardise the review with the Cochrane Review on 'Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes' (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>We considered all randomised controlled comparisons of antenatal corticosteroid administration (betamethasone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) with placebo, or with no treatment, given to women prior to anticipated preterm delivery (elective, or following spontaneous labour), regardless of other co-morbidity, for inclusion in this review. Quasi-randomised (e.g. allocation by date of birth or record number), cross-over and cluster-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included trials where the method of randomisation was not specified in detail in the expectation that their inclusion in this review would encourage the study authors to make available further information on the method of randomisation. We excluded trials where non-randomised cohorts were amalgamated with randomised participants if the results of the randomised participants could not be separated out. We also excluded trials that tested the effect of corticosteroids along with other co-interventions. We included trials in which placebo was not used in the control group.

The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the RevMan 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: that is, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, we presented the results as the average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<P>We performed analysis of clinical groups for primary outcomes only (where data were available).</P>
<P>We analysed the following clinical groups:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>singleton versus multiple pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>intact membranes versus ruptured membranes at first dose;</LI>
<LI>pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes;</LI>
<LI>type of glucocorticoid (betamethasone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone);</LI>
<LI>decade of trial (post-hoc, i.e.not pre-specified in the protocol);</LI>
<LI>protocol with weekly repeats (post hoc, i.e. not pre-specified in the protocol);</LI>
<LI>gestational age at trial entry (post hoc, i.e. not pre-specified in the protocol).</LI>
</OL>
<P>All covariates were proposed after deliberation with clinical experts. We planned to explore potential differences in the effect of corticosteroids in distinct clinical populations, such as pregnant women with ruptured membranes or multiple pregnancy, and in different types of trials.</P>
<P>For the main analysis we did not adjust data for multiple pregnancies to take account of non-independence of outcomes for babies from the same pregnancy. For some outcomes there will be a higher correlation between babies from the same pregnancy than between babies from different pregnancies. The degree of non-independence of outcomes for babies from multiple pregnancies will vary considerably depending on the outcome and the type of multiple pregnancy. For some outcomes the risk of an adverse event will be highly correlated in babies from the same pregnancy (e.g. preterm birth); while for others the degree of correlation will be lower (e.g. fetal death) but still higher than for babies from different pregnancies. In view of this non-independence, subgroup analysis examining fetal and neonatal outcomes in singleton versus multiple pregnancies must be interpreted with particular caution.</P>
<P>We found that some trials included in this review had a protocol of weekly repeat doses of corticosteroid if the mother remained undelivered. None of the trials that allowed weekly repeat doses reported outcomes separately for those exposed to repeat doses. We performed a post hoc analysis for primary outcomes of trials where a single course was used versus those where weekly repeat doses were allowed in the protocol to determine if the inclusion of such trials biased our results. Single versus multiple doses of corticosteroids is the subject of another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2015</LINK>). The analysis in this update will differ from that of the single versus multiple doses review, because the latter review includes only those studies where the women were randomised to either single or multiple doses.</P>
<P>Because the case-fatality rate for RDS has decreased with improvements in neonatal care, we postulated that the effect of corticosteroids may not be as apparent in more recent trials. This hypothesis was tested in a post-hoc subgroup analysis with trials grouped by the main decade of recruitment or publication of results.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Many trials did not report outcome data split according to the listed clinical characteristics (covariates). Due to this missing information, the total number of events/participants in subgroup analysis for some outcomes does not match the overall analysis. We have indicated in footnotes on the forest plots where the data are discrepant between the main analysis and the clinical subgroups.</P>
<P>All analyses by the covariates listed above should be considered hypothesis-generating.</P>
<P>Finally, it should be noted that we did not conduct subgroup analysis where there were too few trials reporting data to conduct meaningful analyses.</P>

Funnel plots for two outcomes 1.4 Perinatal deaths (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and 1.11 IVH (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>) both showed asymmetry. For perinatal deaths, two studies with very low event rates were the funnel plot outliers; one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1988</LINK>) had no events in the corticosteroid arm and one death in the control group, and one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Gyamfi_x002d_Bannerman-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gyamfi-Bannerman 2016</LINK>) had no events in the control arm and two deaths in the corticosteroid group. For IVH, the funnel plot mapped 13 of the 16 studies due to no events in both arms of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Attawattanakul-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Attawattanakul 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dexiprom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dexiprom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansouri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mansouri 2010</LINK>).

<P>In addition, we inspected funnel plots for evidence of asymmetry and possible publication bias in further analyses where exactly 10 trials contributed data: necrotising enterocolitis, need for mechanical ventilation/CPAP and Apgar less than seven at five minutes.

We carried out a sensitivity analysis removing each decade from the overall analysis set and repeating the test for subgroup differences without the decade removed. Removal of all decades apart from the 2000s resulted in significant subgroup differences, suggesting that data from studies conducted in the 2000s contributed significantly to the finding that the decade of study enrolment led to different rates of RDS in infants exposed to corticosteroids. Studies conducted during the 2000s had the greatest efficacy in reducing RDS in infants exposed to corticosteroids (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.59; participants = 839; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 22%) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-03 16:51:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the 30 studies included in this updated review support the conclusion of the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>), that treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces perinatal death, neonatal death, RDS, and IVH in preterm infants. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids is not associated with changes in the rates of maternal death, maternal endometritis or chorioamnionitis, fetal death, neonatal chronic lung disease, or birthweight. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids is associated with a reduction in the incidence of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and systemic infections in the first 48 hours of life, as well as a reduction in the need for respiratory support and NICU admission.</P>
<P>Whether antenatal corticosteroids are beneficial in the current era of advanced neonatal practice has been questioned on the basis that previous conclusions concerning their benefits drew on data from the 1970s. In this update, we have included nine trials published since 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-Attawattanakul-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Attawattanakul 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balci-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Balci 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fekih-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fekih 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyamfi_x002d_Bannerman-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gyamfi-Bannerman 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khazardoust-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khazardoust 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansouri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mansouri 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Porto 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qublan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Qublan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shanks-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shanks 2010</LINK>), as well as analyses for the previous decades. These more recent trials contributed 51% of the overall data to the review. Overall, the results show consistent benefits of steroid use, without any strong evidence that antenatal corticosteroids are not beneficial in the current era of advanced neonatal practice. In subgroup analysis two decades suggested heterogeneity of the results between decades for only one each of the eight primary outcomes analysed; studies conducted in the decade of the 2000s appeared to show that corticosteroids had a greater effect on reducing RDS, the opposite result to that expected if antenatal corticosteroids are not beneficial in the current era of advanced neonatal practice. Studies conducted in the 1980s appeared to show that corticosteroids had no effect in reducing neonatal death (removal of this group in sensitivity analysis explained subgroup heterogeneity), with no evidence of effect also seen in the most recent decade (2010s). However, as the sole study (<LINK REF="STD-Gyamfi_x002d_Bannerman-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gyamfi-Bannerman 2016</LINK>) conducted in the 2010s was conducted in near term infants who have very low rates of neonatal death, and with studies conducted in the decades of the 1990s and 2000s showing a clear statistical and clinical benefit in terms of neonatal death, RDS and IVH, we conclude that antenatal corticosteroids continue to have a strong role in supporting current methods of obstetric and neonatal practice.</P>
<P>The gestational age range at which antenatal corticosteroids provide benefit has been subject to debate. Previous reviews have had difficulty demonstrating benefit at gestations less than 26 weeks and beyond 36 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Once again it was not possible to test this adequately using trial level data; ideally this question should be investigated with individual patient data analysis using a priori agreed gestational age cut-offs. In this update, we examined outcomes based on gestational age divisions of up to, and including, 35 weeks + 0 days and greater than, and including, 34 weeks + 0 days. Although this post hoc analysis is exploratory, and 17 studies have data in the overlapping 34 weeks + 0 days to 35 weeks + 0 days gestational age group, we found no evidence of a difference in effect of antenatal corticosteroids in the two gestational age groups for the seven primary outcomes analysed. The most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Gyamfi_x002d_Bannerman-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gyamfi-Bannerman 2016</LINK>) included in this review enrolled 2831 women from 34 weeks + 0 days until 36 weeks + 5 days, and found a clinical benefit in terms of a primary outcome of requirement for respiratory support in the first 72 hours of life (11.6% versus 14.4%), but with increased neonatal hypoglycaemia (24% versus 15%) for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Consistent with this we have demonstrated a clear statistical and clinical benefit of corticosteroids on RDS in six studies providing data from 34 weeks + 0 days gestation, but not with other primary outcomes. Thus in very late preterm gestation women (from 35 weeks + 0 days) the use of antenatal corticosteroids needs to be considered in light of the balance of risks and benefits.</P>
<P>The relationship between the time interval from first dose to delivery and outcome, and how this is influenced by factors such as whether corticosteroids were given and how many doses a women received, can only be determined by an individual patient data analysis. We were not able to do this in this update. We were able to undertake an analysis comparing outcomes in mothers and children exposed to studies allowing only a single course versus study protocols allowing weekly repeats if infants remained undelivered. We found no differences between these two study protocol groups. The effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids is the subject of a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2015</LINK>), which found that although repeated doses reduced the severity of neonatal lung disease, there were insufficient data to exclude other beneficial or harmful effects to the mother or infant. The Crowther review awaits the outcome of trials looking at the long-term effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids.</P>
<P>We did not find any evidence that the effect of antenatal corticosteroids was different in the subgroups of women with multiple pregnancies, premature rupture of membranes and hypertension syndromes. However as discrete RDS data from infants of women with multiple pregnancies contributed to 4.1% of the total RDS data, and discrete data from infants of women with hypertension syndromes and premature rupture of membranes contributed to 4.9% and 14.5% of the total RDS data respectively, there needs to be caution in the interpretation of these findings. Further caution is required due to the number of studies in which subgroup classification data were not available.</P>
<P>In this update, we have included a comparison of studies using dexamethasone as a trial protocol with studies using betamethasone. We found no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the two types of corticosteroids, apart from less maternal chorioamnionitis occurring with betamethasone. Our analysis is subject to bias as allocation to one type of corticosteroid or the other was not subject to randomisation. However, consistent with our results a review by <LINK REF="REF-Brownfoot-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownfoot 2013</LINK> and colleagues (10 studies; 1089 women and 1161 infants) compared different corticosteroid regimens and found insufficient evidence to support the use of one corticosteroid over the other.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data from follow-up studies into childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Collaborative-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Collaborative 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kari-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kari 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liggins-1972b" TYPE="STUDY">Liggins 1972b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schutte-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schutte 1980</LINK>) and into adulthood (<LINK REF="STD-Liggins-1972b" TYPE="STUDY">Liggins 1972b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schutte-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schutte 1980</LINK>) included in this review. Just one small study reported neurodevelopmental delay in childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Kari-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kari 1994</LINK>; n = 82). There are also limited data for developmental delay in childhood (two trials; n = 518). Five trials report potential improvement in rates of cerebral palsy in childhood, though confidence intervals are wide and cross the line of no effect. Just two included studies followed up into adulthood (<LINK REF="STD-Liggins-1972b" TYPE="STUDY">Liggins 1972b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schutte-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schutte 1980</LINK>) and found no differences in intellectual impairment or educational achievement between those exposed to a single course of antenatal corticosteroids and those exposed to placebo. This has largely contributed to dispelling previous concerns regarding decreased brain growth after antenatal corticosteroid exposure from animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exposure to excess corticosteroids before birth is a postulated mechanism underlying the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benediktsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benediktsson 1993</LINK>). Increased insulin release has been found 30 minutes following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in one follow-up study conducted at age 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Liggins-1972b" TYPE="STUDY">Liggins 1972b</LINK>). However, the same study found no difference in blood pressure, fasting lipids, body size, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function or the prevalence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Thus, while the finding of increased insulin resistance in adulthood provides support for excess corticosteroids as a mechanism underlying the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis, it should not be seen as a reason to withhold antenatal corticosteroids given the large and clinically substantial benefits seen in the neonatal period.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:33:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have attempted to identify all available published and unpublished randomised trial data for the use of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth. Additional data have been obtained and included where possible. We feel that the data are comprehensive and relevant to women at risk of preterm birth. Comparisons of repeat antenatal corticosteroid regimens, of different antenatal corticosteroids and of the use of antenatal corticosteroids at term before elective birth are described in other Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brownfoot-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownfoot 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sotiriadis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sotiriadis 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence here is applicable to most hospital settings in mid- or high-income countries. More evidence from low-income settings would help support the overall applicability of the data. For example, data in this review for RDS come from 15 different countries, but only one of these is a low-income country (Tunisia). The issue of generalisability of the current evidence has also been highlighted in the recent cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="REF-Althabe-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althabe 2014</LINK>). This trial suggested harms from better compliance with antenatal corticosteroid administration in women at risk of delivering preterm in communities of low-resource settings (<LINK REF="REF-Althabe-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althabe 2014</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:51:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence described in this review is based on 30 randomised controlled trials comparing antenatal corticosteroids with no antenatal corticosteroids. Overall the evidence is consistent. There are some limitations in 13 of the trials where there was no blinding of the intervention, and there was insufficient information in 14 trials to enable the review authors to make judgements on the processes of randomisation or allocation concealment. The lack of information is most likely due to the era in which the trials were conducted, when this information was not a requirement for publication.</P>
<P>We assessed seven outcomes with GRADE methodology, as shown in the 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). For pregnant women, evidence was graded as of moderate quality for three outcomes: maternal death, chorioamnionitis and endometritis. Downgrading in each case was for imprecision due to wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. There were very few data for maternal death.</P>
<P>For infants, evidence for four outcomes was also graded to be of moderate quality. We downgraded evidence for perinatal death, RDS, IVH and birthweight for risks of bias in the included trials. A grade of moderate quality suggests we have some reservations about the available data and its quality due specifically to unclear risks of bias for allocation concealment or randomisation and unclear or high risks of bias for lack of blinding or incomplete outcome data in some trials included in the meta-analyses.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-02-08 11:32:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe we have made sufficient attempts to reduce the potential bias of the review process. We have attempted to identify all relevant trials and two or more researchers have independently appraised the trial and extracted the data required. Where data were missing, we have contacted the original trialists and some additional data have been provided that enhances the content of this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-02-08 11:34:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current systematic reviews of antenatal corticosteroids including the World Health Organization have used earlier versions of this review on which to base their recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review conducted for a bi-national clinical practice guideline for Australia and New Zealand in 2015 reported on the same maternal and neonatal benefits as the primary outcomes of this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Antenatal-Corticosteroid-CPG-Panel-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antenatal Corticosteroid CPG Panel 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent systematic review of observational studies has analysed the use of antenatal corticosteroids in specific populations of pregnant women at risk of impending preterm birth (with gestational age 34 to 37 weeks); the authors considered evidence for pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus; pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section (34 to 37 weeks' gestation; pregnant women with chorioamnionitis; and pregnant women with growth-restricted fetuses) (<LINK REF="REF-Amiya-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiya 2016</LINK>). There was no available evidence (randomised or observational) for women with gestational diabetes or for pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section. For pregnant women with chorioamnionitis, pooled evidence from eight studies (1424 women) showed a benefit of steroid use for the outcomes of neonatal death, RDS, IVH and severe IVH; consistent with the conclusions of this review. There were no data available from these studies for maternal outcomes for women with chorioamnionitis. For pregnant women with growth-restricted fetuses, the results were inconclusive. There were no clear benefits for growth-restricted babies for outcomes measuring neonatal mortality or morbidity, including RDS, and the authors called for further research in this population. Using GRADE methods, review authors assessed all evidence for individual outcomes in the review as of low or very low quality, due to observational study design and, most often, imprecision due to wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Amiya-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiya 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>As mentioned above, additional evidence is required to better understand the potential for adverse effects with steroid use in low-resource settings (<LINK REF="REF-Althabe-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althabe 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Azad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azad 2014</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-02-08 11:36:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from this review update supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids in women at risk of preterm birth. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of perinatal death, neonatal death, RDS, IVH, necrotising enterocolitis, need for respiratory support and NICU admission, even in the current era of advanced neonatal care.</P>
<P>Antenatal corticosteroids can continue to be used in women at high risk of preterm birth. Further information is required regarding the optimal dose-to-delivery interval, the optimal steroid, the effects in multiple pregnancy and long-term effects into adulthood. We advise that birth should not be delayed to administer antenatal corticosteroids when there are serious concerns about maternal condition that will be alleviated by expedited delivery.</P>
<P>It is important to note that most of the evidence in this review comes from high-income countries and hospital settings; therefore, the results may not be applicable to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-09 12:28:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little need for further trials of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids versus placebo in singleton pregnancies in high-income countries and hospital settings. However, data are sparse in lower-income settings. There are also few data regarding risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroids in multiple pregnancies and other high-risk obstetric groups. We encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information, which may answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids in such pregnancies without the need for further randomised controlled trials. Individual patient data meta-analysis from published trials is likely to answer some of the evidence gaps. Follow-up studies into childhood and adulthood, particularly in the late-preterm-gestation and repeat-courses groups are needed. The possible harmful effects of antenatal corticosteroids in low-resource settings were not examined in this review. It would be particularly relevant to explore this finding in adequately powered prospective trials.</P>

<P>P Crowley's first, unstructured review of antenatal corticosteroids was conducted at the suggestion of Professor Dennis Hawkins in 1980. Dr Anne Anderson encouraged her to use it as a basis for an early meta-analysis in 1981. Her work at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit in 1980 to 1981 was funded by the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin at the suggestion of the then Master, Dr Dermot MacDonald. This review was first published in structured form on the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials in 1989. The preparation and continued updating of the original review would have been impossible without the help of Iain and Jan Chalmers, Marc Keirse, Jini Hetherington, Sonja Henderson and Professor Zarko Alfirevic.</P>

<P>(Summary of comment received from Zohar Nachum, September 2002)</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Only two small trials report outcome following a multiple pregnancy. Therefore there is currently not enough evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in multiple pregnancy. Nevertheless, in view of the strength of the overall evidence, it would seem sensible to offer a single course of steroids to women with a multiple pregnancy at risk of preterm birth. </P>

<P>It is unclear whether quasi-randomised trials should be included. The abstract states they are included, types of studies says they are excluded, and a quasi-randomised study has been included (Morales 1986).</P>
<P>Also some data appear to be missing from the meta-analysis. Silver 1995 does not contribute any information to the outcome neonatal death, yet the data are reported in the abstract you reference (7/54 deaths on dexamethasone, 8/42 deaths on placebo).</P>

<P>The results, and reviewer's conclusions, are that administering corticosteroids (24 mg betamethasone, or 24 mg dexamethasone) to women who are expected to give birth at 28-34 weeks' gestation reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, there is no clarification of how this should be prescribed. Standard regimens are for 48 hours treatment, using either 12 mg betamethasone IM every 24 hours, or 6 mg dexamethasone IM every 12 hours. But data in this review show the maximum benefit for corticosteroids is after 24 hours of treatment.</P>
<P>I have some questions about how to maximise the benefit in clinical practice.</P>
<P>1) For a woman in preterm labor who is being given tocolytic treatment to facilitate steroid administration, how long should tocolytics be continued, 24 hours or 48 hours?</P>
<P>2) Would the benefit of steroids be the same for a modified regimen over 24 hours, for example 8 mg dexamethasone IM every 8 hours for 3 doses, or 12 mg dexamethasone IM every 12 hours? Will this affect adrenal suppression and fetal growth like repeated doses?</P>
<P>3) Do we need a review comparing the benefits and adverse events between different regimens of prophylactic corticosteroids?</P>

<P>(Summary of comment from Mark Selinger, December 2005)</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Presumably the original sheep studies were done with parenteral steroids, so perhaps the initial extrapolation to humans was intramuscular use. We are not aware of evidence about the effects of oral administration.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>There have been two recent reports(1,2) of 30-year follow-up of people recruited whilst in utero to Liggins 1972a. Both used intention-to-treat analysis, as does this review. One of these reports (1) stated " that there were similar numbers of neonatal survivors with much the same perinatal morbidity in both treatment and control groups". Clearly this means that Liggins 1972a showed no overall benefit in terms of survival or morbidity, which to me seem the most important end points. </P>
<P>Liggins 1972a forms a major part of this Cochrane review, yet the data from the follow-up reports differ from those in the review. This new evidence therefore raises questions about the validity of the Cochrane meta-analysis. There are also discrepancies between this version of the review, and its earlier published versions, for some of the other trials. The version published in Effective care in Pregnancy and Childbirth (3) contained 12 trials reporting the effect of corticosteroids on early neonatal death (0-7 days). Some of these 12 are in the analysis presented here of corticosteroids versus placebo for the outcome neonatal death (0-28 days). However, for Liggins 1972a, Block 1977, Gamsu 1989, and Morales 1989 the data remain unchanged between the two reviews. Does this mean there were no deaths from 8-28 days? We now know this is not true for Liggins 1972a. There is also something peculiar about the randomisation in Schmidt 1984. Between appearing in Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth and inclusion in the Cochrane review 15 women were added to this study, all in the treatment group and with no change in the number of deaths.</P>
<P>I understand an update of the review is in preparation. However, since the early nineties it would have been considered unethical to carry out a randomised trial of steroids versus placebo and so I do not expect any new trials to have become available since the last Cochrane review in 2002.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Since Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth appeared, nine randomised controlled trials of antenatal corticosteroids have been published. These trials are now included in the updated Cochrane review. This updated review shows the contribution of each study to the outcome measures, and describes the methodological quality of each included trial. </P>
<P>For Liggins 1972a, the previous Cochrane review (Crowley 1996) included data that were published at that time Hence, data for perinatal death (stillbirth or death in the first week of life) were included. However, the updated Cochrane review includes an intention-to-treat analysis of the original data from Liggins 1972a. These data were not available for the previous review (Crowley 1996). This updated review therefore now includes data for neonatal death (death in the first 28 days of life) in Liggins 1972a. </P>
<P>Data reported for Schmidt 1984 included a third arm of women and infants who had been excluded from randomisation. This study is now excluded from the review. </P>

<P>It is good to see the updated review has incorporated intention to treat analysis for all the trials. In the paragraph entitled "Effects of antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth" the third sentence referring to the 1990 review by Crowley et al (1) is not strictly correct. "This review showed that corticosteroids ... are effective in preventing respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal mortality." In fact that analysis was for early neonatal deaths (deaths in the first seven days) only. Subsequently the Cochrane review used neonatal deaths (deaths in the first 28 days) and, as I pointed out in my feedback on the last update, data from some of the trials (Liggins 1972a, Block 1977, Gamsu 1989, and Morales 1989) are still the same as the previous data reported as early neonatal deaths. Therefore, to be correct, the above sentence should end "...preventing respiratory distress and early neonatal mortality."</P>
<P>Confusion remains regarding the results of three trials. Differences in the data for neonatal death between this update and the previous version (Table 1) are unexplained. For Block 1977 and Gamsu 1989 the differences are minor, but for Morales 1986 they are larger. These changes merit some comment.</P>
<P>Table 1 Differences in the data for neonatal mortality:</P>
<P>Block 1977<BR/>Previous update: Treatment (n/N) = 1/69; Control (n/N) = 5/61<BR/>This update: Treatment (n/N) = 1/57; Control (n/N) = 5/53</P>
<P>Gamsu 1989<BR/>Previous update: Treatment (n/N) = 14/131; Control (n/N) = 20/137<BR/>This update: Treatment (n/N) = 14/130; Control (n/N) = 17/132</P>
<P>Morales 1986<BR/>Previous update: Treatment (n/N) = 7/121; Control (n/N) = 13/124<BR/>This update: Treatment (n/N) = 7/87; Control (n/N) = 8/78</P>
<P>Finally, data from Liggins 1972a has been adjusted and is now presented as an intention to treat analysis. Precise details about the cause of death are not available. Data for Block 1977, Gamsu 1989 and Morales 1986 are not quite as old as that for Liggins 1972a, nevertheless, it is surprising that secure reanalysis of these studies was available after all these years.</P>
