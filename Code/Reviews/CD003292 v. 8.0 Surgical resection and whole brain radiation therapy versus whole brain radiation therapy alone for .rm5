<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:02:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For patients with single brain metastasis there is good evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that surgery in addition to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) does not improve overall survival.Treatment of brain metastasis is usually palliative although in selected patients - particularly those with only a single metastasis to the brain - surgery could be considered. This review analysed the evidence from three RCTs, enrolling a select group of patients, and found that the combination of surgery and WBRT did not improve overall survival compared with WBRT alone. The addition of surgery may improve the length of time patients remained independent from others for support and there is a suggestion it may also reduce the risk of death due to neurological causes. Patients undergoing surgery were not reported have a higher risk of adverse events than patients who only had WBRT. Decisions on the treatment for an individual patient are best made as part of a multidisciplinary team.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-26 15:41:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The treatment of brain metastasis is generally palliative since most patients have uncontrollable systemic cancer. Historically, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been the treatment of choice, although more recently focused radiation therapy e.g. stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has developed a role in selected patients. In certain circumstances, such as single brain metastasis, death may be more likely from brain involvement than systemic disease. In this group surgical resection has been proposed to relieve symptoms and prolong survival.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-01-26 15:43:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The following databases were part of a systematic literature search: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Biosis and the Science Citation Index. References of identified studies were hand searched, as were the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-Oncology, including all conference abstracts.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-26 15:45:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Three RCTs were identified enrolling 195 patients in total. No significant difference in survival was found (hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55, P = 0.40) although there was heterogeneity between trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83%). One trial found surgery and WBRT increased the duration of Functionally Independent Survival (FIS) (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82, P = 0.01). There was some indication that surgery and WBRT might reduce the risk of deaths due to neurological cause (relative risk (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.09, P = 0.11). The risk of adverse events was not statistically proven to be different between arms although actual event numbers were higher in the surgery arm.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-29 12:39:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery and WBRT may improve FIS but not overall survival. It may also reduce the proportion of deaths due to neurological cause. All these results were in a highly selected group of patients.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:03:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:02:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Brain metastasis are cancers that spread to the brain from a primary site outside of the brain. Metastasis are the most frequent type of brain malignancy, comprising around 50% of all brain tumours, and have an incidence of 14 cases per 100,000 population a year (<LINK REF="REF-Counsell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Counsell 1998</LINK>). They occur in between 20 to 40% of those with cancer, as determined at autopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Posner-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posner 1978</LINK>), with the most common primary sites being lung and breast. Patients usually present with a short history of focal neurological symptoms, symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, or seizures. Symptoms vary depending on the site, size and number of metastasis. Previously around 50% of brain metastases were thought to be single (<LINK REF="REF-Delattre-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delattre 1988</LINK>) although advances in brain imaging suggest this figure is now closer to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Schaeffer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaeffer 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, the treatment is palliative, as most patients have uncontrollable cancer outside the brain. Steroids frequently cause a resolution or improvement of symptoms but side effects can be problematic and without further treatment neurological symptoms will recur (<LINK REF="REF-Kaal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaal 2004</LINK>). Median survival in patients having no treatment after diagnosis of brain metastases is one month, with most patients dying from their neurological disease. For patients taking steroids it is two months, and for people taking steroids and undergoing WBRT it is three to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Cairncross-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairncross 1980</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:02:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has historically been the accepted palliative treatment of choice with potential benefits including relief of symptoms and longer survival (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-II-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker II 2005</LINK>). Patients who respond to radiation are usually less than 60 years old, have a good Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (greater than 70), have radiosensitive primary tumours and controlled primary disease with metastatic spread confined to the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Diener_x002d_West-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diener-West 1989</LINK>). The optimal dose fractionation schedule for treatment of brain metastases remains uncertain and varies widely (<LINK REF="REF-Tsao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsao 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Focal radiotherapy techniques, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), have been developed that focus higher radiotherapy doses on the metastasis but with less damage to surrounding brain than WBRT (<LINK REF="REF-Patil-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patil 2010</LINK>). This has been proposed to provide increased local control and potentially fewer long-term cognitive side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical resection involves a craniotomy and surgical excision of the lesion. It is commonly performed under general anaesthesia although can be performed 'awake' when cortical stimulation is justified to identify eloquent tissue. The lesion is removed using microsurgical techniques or macroscopically. Post-operatively the patient will recover in more intensively monitored environments initially prior to discharge. Most patients will not be suitable for surgery because of multiple lesions, a surgically inaccessible lesion location, active primary disease, or co-morbidity.</P>
<P>Following surgery or SRS, WBRT is usually recommended to prevent local recurrence and target any micro-metastases not detected on initial imaging; this management is based on the findings of a single RCT that found those undergoing WBRT after surgery have a reduced local recurrence rate compared with those who had surgery alone (<LINK REF="REF-Patchell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patchell 1998</LINK>). Previosuly, symptomatic radiation induced dementia was previously believed to be rare with modern dosing schedules, with one chart-review study revealing a frequency of less than 5% (<LINK REF="REF-DeAngelis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeAngelis 1989</LINK>). Recent studies have increasingly recognised the cognitive effects of WBRT, particularly with an increase in survival times, and questioned the routine use of WBRT after surgery or SRS (<LINK REF="REF-Aoyama-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoyama 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soffieti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soffieti 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:03:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Surgical resection provides its main benefits through direct removal of the targeted mass lesion. It has been proposed to help maintain a patients quality of life (QoL), prevent death directly from the metastasis and prolong survival. In patients with raised intra-cranial pressure surgery can be life saving and bring immediate relief of symptoms. Surgery also provides the opportunity to assess the histology of the lesion as some lesions thought to be metastasis may have an alternative origin requiring different treatment (e.g. brain abscess). The potential benefits of surgical resection must be balanced against the risks of post-operative morbidity and mortality.</P>
<P>Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is designed to treat identified metastasis as well as prophylaxis against any 'micro-metastasis' not detected on pre-intervention imaging. Radiation therapy in general is aimed at inducing terminal damage to the DNA of neoplastic cells. It is administered on an out-patient basis for five days a week over two weeks.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-12-29 17:50:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there are in theory advantages to having a metastasis surgically removed there is also a definite risk involved with undergoing surgery. There are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses in this area and the choice of treatment is controversial. In order to improve patient outcomes maximise the use of resources it is necessary to have a clear description of the potential risks and benefits of surgery in treating patients with single brain metastasis.</P>

<P>Patients with proven systemic cancer (i.e. primary site confirmed by histology) and a suspected single brain metastasis (on imaging and clinical findings) were included. Imaging had to include at least CT although ideally contrast enhanced MRI to optimise sensitivity for detecting multiple metastasis. Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. The brain metastasis did not have to be histologically proven pre-hoc (e.g. by biopsy). Patients should have been stratified by age, performance status, primary tumour and extent of systemic disease as these are the strongest prognostic factors (<LINK REF="STD-Noordijk-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Noordijk 1994</LINK>). Performance status could be recorded using the KPS (<LINK REF="REF-Karnofsky-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnofsky 1948</LINK>) or the World Health Organisation Score (WHO/ECOG) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1982</LINK>).</P>

<P>Surgical resection and WBRT versus WBRT alone, defined as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Surgical resection: all procedures where the pre-operative aim was to remove more tissue than is necessary for diagnosis. The technique normally involved general anaesthesia, craniotomy and attempted total macroscopic microsurgical resection of the lesion. All aids to achieving surgical resection - including neuro-navigation, 5-ALA/Gliloan guided resection, awake craniotomy, Sonowand and intra-operative MRI - were eligible for inclusion. Extent of resection was often graded as either total macroscopic, partial or de-bulking; all of which were eligible for inclusion. Assessment of complete resection could have been made by the surgeons operating opinion but ideally by early post-operative imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Hensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensen 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>WBRT: conventional whole brain radiotherapy fractionation schedules were 3000 cGy in 10 fractions or 2000 cGy in 5 fractions. There is currently no evidence that alternative schedules or administration of radiosensitising agents improves patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Tsao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsao 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS): techniques such as LINAC, Gamma Knife, Cyberknife or proton beam were not eligible for inclusion in either arm of this review.</LI>
<LI>Post-operative care: was decided by the individual attending physician on an individual patient basis in light of the absence of specific evidence based therapies at this stage.</LI>

<LI>Functionally independent survival (FIS): time to KPS less than 70 or other grading system from randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Neurological death: whether a person died primarily from their intracerebral metastasis rather than fulminant systemic disease. A neurological death was also one where both systemic and brain metastasis were active at the time of death, as this would be a failure of the brain treatment. Death from neurological cause also involved acute deterioration (from either rapid growth of the metastasis, haemorrhage, invasion of local structure or decompensation of raised intra-cerebral pressure) or more gradual tumour expansion and deterioration of neurologic function. Care was taken to try and distinguish any contribution that treatment related morbidity may have contributed.</LI>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-01-26 16:50:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The first study by was a single institution RCT set in Kentucky, USA (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>). It randomised 48 patients to confirmatory brain tumour biopsy followed by WBRT or surgical resection of metastasis and WBRT. Randomisation was by computer generated random numbers after stratification for prognostic factors but outcome assessors were not blinded. It included mainly young (mean age 60 years) and fit subjects (mean KPS = 90). All participants underwent pre-operative MRI whilst those in the radiotherapy arm also underwent biopsy. Outcome measures included survival, functional independence, radiographic changes in tumour size, time to recurrence and cause of death. The logHRs for survival and FIS and their standard errors, as estimated by Cox regression, were reported to us by the trial's lead statistician.</P>
<P>The second study was multi-centre RCT set in the Netherlands. It randomised 63 patients to surgical resection followed by WBRT versus WBRT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK>). Randomisation was performed centrally by telephone in blocks after stratification for prognostic factors but outcome assessors were not blinded. The participants were mainly young (mean age 60 years) but slightly less fit (WHO score of 2 or less) than in the previous study. Only CT imaging had to be performed and biopsy was not mandatory in the radiotherapy only group. The minimum and maximum duration of follow to up were assumed to be 1 and 70 months respectively. Outcome measures included survival, functionally independent survival and cause of death. The log (HR) and its standard error were estimated from the published survival curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final study was a multi-centre RCT set in Canada. It randomised 84 patients to surgical resection followed by WBRT versus WBRT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>). Randomisation was by central telephone randomisation after stratification for prognostic factors but outcome assessors were not blinded. This patients were mainly young (median age 59 years) but entry criteria allowed less fit patients (KPS of 50 or more) than in the previous two studies. Only CT imaging was required and biopsy was only undertaken when the diagnosis was in doubt. Outcome measures were survival, cause of death, functional status (by KPS) and QOL (using Spitzer QOL index), and surgical complications within 30 days. The minimum and maximum duration of follow to up were assumed to be 0 and 34 months respectively. The logHR and its standard error were estimated from the published survival curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>All studies included adequate methods of randomising patients. In the trial by Patchell (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>), selection of cases for randomisation was by a single neurosurgeon, which may have resulted in inclusion of only those most suitable for surgery. However, there was no obvious discrepancy in any prognostic factors between the groups. In the trial by Mintz (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>), it is not clear the reasons why so many people who were suitable for inclusion in the trial refused randomisation when compared with the other trials. There is the possibility then that the group randomised in the Mintz trial is not representative of all those eligible.</P>

<P>The reports of adverse events were difficult to interpret as more than one adverse event was reported for some patients and this was not clearly described in the included RCTs. The statistical analysis did not allow for the clustering of events within patients; correct allowance for this would widen the CIs.

Mortality at 30 days was also similar in both arms of each of the trials. No statistical heterogeneity between these findings was identified (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%). Individual subcategories did not demonstrate that any one type of complication was significantly more likely in one group than the other.</P>
<P>The Patchell study did not report adverse effects by category. The Vecht study reported complications in the surgical arm as: respiratory problems (4), intracerebral haematoma (1), infectious disease (3) and other complications (9). These were in 13 patients and serious in 4. The Mintz study reported: infections (surgery 1 versus WBRT 1); haematoma (surgery 3 versus WBRT 0); other (surgery 7 versus WBRT 7).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-26 16:55:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Although no statistically significant difference between surgery plus WBRT and WBRT alone was found in the meta to analysis, the trials by Patchell and Vecht were in favour of surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK>), while that by Mintz was in favour of WBRT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>). The key differences between the trials are the decreased survival of those in WBRT alone in the trial by Patchell, and the decreased survival for those treated by surgery and WBRT in the trial by Mintz. Two possible reasons may account for the findings in the Patchell trial. Firstly, the majority of their patients had non-small cell lung cancer, a highly radio-resistant tumour, which would not be expected to respond to WBRT particularly well. Secondly, there may be a selection bias, as patients were selected for surgery in a specialist unit by a single neurosurgeon. This may have resulted in randomisation of only patients who were particularly suited to surgery.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>In the Mintz trial, the key issue is why patients who underwent surgery had a poorer survival than those who did not. The entry criteria allowed patients with a poorer KPS and a larger percentage had extracranial metastases (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Patients with a lower KPS and extracranial disease are known to have a poorer survival hence the potential benefits of surgery may not be applicable in this more ill population. The radiotherapy group had a considerably longer time between primary tumour diagnosis and metastasis than the surgery group, possibly reflecting less aggressive disease, which is known to confer a better survival (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, the entry criteria did not specify a minimum life expectancy of six months, as in the other two trials. The patients examined by Mintz, having in general a lower life expectancy and more active disease, would seem less likely to benefit from surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>). It could be that in this group of patients the surgical approach does not provide any improvement in survival, but in a more selected group (examined in the other two trials) surgery may increase survival.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-26 16:59:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Although much focus is put on the benefit in survival times, equally important is the benefit to patients' QoL, as few patients were cured overall. No trial directly examined QoL, which is a major shortcoming; FIS was examined in only one trial although KPS is known to correlate poorly with patients' own perception of QoL. The one trial did find an improvement in FIS with surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>). In addition the trial by Vecht found an improvement in FIS in patients treated by surgery who had stable extra-cranial disease (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK>), although the trial by Mintz found little difference between arms in the stable extra-cranial disease subgroup (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>). It has been noted that patients in general maintain their functional independence until a few months before death after both approaches, and that after surgery there is a trend for the patients' KPS score to improve, although this is mainly in those who have a high score already (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK>). It would be of benefit for further trials to clarify exactly the nature of this benefit in QoL, especially in regard to a reduction in the dose of steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 1990</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-01-26 17:00:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>In all trials the number of patients was very small (84, 48 and 63 in the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK> respectively), due in part to the highly selected nature of cases. In the trial by Patchell, sample size was calculated with a highly optimistic end point in mind, derived from a previous non-randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Patchell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patchell 1986</LINK>). In the trial by Vecht, the slow rate of entry of participants meant it took over six years to accrue all their data (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1993</LINK>). This opens up questions as to the standardisation of treatment during this time. The trial by Mintz found 143 capable of being randomised, although only 84 consented to trial randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Mintz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mintz 1996</LINK>). This demonstrates that it is possible to generate much larger numbers, but only in a large multi to institution study.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-12-30 11:23:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review only included the results of highly selected series of patients and the findings are not necessarily applicable to a larger cohort of those with brain metastasis. It is important to note that there are many other important indications for operating on metastases, for example raised intra-cerebral pressure or obstructive hydrocephalus. There may also be other benefits to surgery which were not examined in any of the three RCTs, such as reducing steroid doses, improving control during WBRT and improving some neurological symptoms. In the case of a single brain metastasis without an obvious primary site, the case for resection is well established for histological confirmation. Authors have suggested that for certain radio-resistant tumours, such as non-small cell lung cancer, surgery should always be considered in the management (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 1990</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-26 17:00:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Another systematic review and meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Mintz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintz 2007</LINK>). This review heavily cites this Cochrane review and the conclusions are appropriately concordant. Another systematic review and evidence based practice guideline has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Gaspar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaspar 2010</LINK>). This review stated that surgical resection plus WBRT for single brain metastasis is an effective treatment based on the findings of the three known RCTs also included in this Cochrane review. Only a descriptive analysis of the RCTs was performed and the omission of a meta-analysis is a disappointing shortcoming of their review. We have shown that the correct interpretation of the three RCTs is critically dependent on the meta-analysis, which reveals that surgery does not lead to a longer survival time compared to WBRT alone, necessitating that our conclusions surpass the findings in their review. Other non-systematic review articles in the field have broadly recommended surgery for single brain metastasis based on the findings of the two selected RCTs that are in favour of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ewend-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewend 2005</LINK>). This Cochrane review offers a higher level of evidence due to it's meta-analysis, thorough discussion of individual RCTs, and transparent methodology aimed at producing un-biased conclusions.</P>

<P>It is difficult to advise either patients or colleagues on the basis of evidence from such small studies. It is important to note that these results were obtained in a highly selected group of patients - under close follow-up and receiving further active therapy in many cases - who are not necessarily representative of the majority of those with single brain metastasis. In this group, the surgical approach did not improve OS. Surgery may reduce the number of deaths due to neurological cause, while one trial has suggested an increase in the duration of a patients FIS. Adverse events were similar in each group whilst QoL was not directly examined. Those most likely to benefit from surgery are of young age, have good neurological function, and controlled primary disease (<LINK REF="STD-Noordijk-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Noordijk 1994</LINK>). Careful attention to prognostic factors will see only those who have the most to gain from surgery, while those who are less well will avoid unnecessary risks and morbidity. It must not be forgotten that the overall outlook for patients at two years is dismally poor with either intervention and death is commonly due to systemic disease. Currently, the management for the majority of those with single brain metastasis will be WBRT alone, due to active systemic disease and other co-morbidity. Decisions of the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient should be made at an MDT meeting in line with NICE guidance (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Further trials in this area would help increase the robustness of the data both by answering methodological shortcomings and recruiting greater numbers. Follow-up should be longer and at patients examined at closer intervals. Statistically, the reporting in trials of HRs and their variance would improve the accuracy in reading data from Kaplan-Meier plots. These results could be combined in future updates of this review to provide an up-to-date conclusion on management of single brain metastasis.</P>
<P>Recently, much attention has been given to focal radiotherapy techniques, known as Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS). A meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Stafinski-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stafinski 2006</LINK>) and a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Patil-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patil 2010</LINK>) of three RCTS (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chougle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chougle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>) comparing SRS and WBRT versus WBRT alone both found that combination therapy improved survival in only those with single but not multiple brain metastasis. A single RCT has examined surgery and WBRT in comparison with SRS and found, after terminating prematurely, that survival and local control is comparable but distant recurrences more common with SRS alone (<LINK REF="REF-Muacevic-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muacevic 2008</LINK>); another similar RCT is on-going (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2008</LINK>). In the future the management of single brain metastasis is likely to focus on surgery versus SRS and the role of WBRT (<LINK REF="REF-Aoyama-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoyama 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soffieti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soffieti 2010</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>A similar search strategy to the one for BIOSIS was used. Searches were made in the title, keyword or abstract. Unlike BIOSIS, there was no "major concepts" search facility.<BR/>The differences were as follows:<BR/>(1) "tumo*" was used in place of "tumo?r"<BR/>(2) "central &amp; nervous &amp; system &amp; tumo*" and "central &amp; nervous &amp; neoplasm" were two additional searches<BR/>(3) "extent &amp; resection" was used in place of "extent of resection"</P>
