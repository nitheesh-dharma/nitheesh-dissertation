<TITLE>Interventions for the prevention and treatment of pes cavus (high-arched foot deformity)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-19 06:42:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pes cavus is characterised by an excessively high medial longitudinal arch (the arch on the inside of the foot) and is typically defined as a high-arched or supinated foot type. Population based studies suggest the prevalence of pes cavus is approximately 10%, and its cause is primarily neuromuscular (for example Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) or idiopathic (unknown) in nature. It has been estimated that 60% of people with cavus feet will experience chronic foot pain at some time in their life, most commonly beneath the forefoot (for example metatarsalgia, sesamoiditis) or heel (for example plantar fasciitis). Conditions such as these are thought to be the result of abnormal pressure distribution across the sole of the foot during walking. Many conservative therapies and surgical procedures have been recommended for cavus-related foot pain. In particular, foot orthoses (aids applied and worn on the outside of the body to support the bony structures) customised to an individual's foot shape are increasingly prescribed by podiatrists, physiotherapists, orthopaedic surgeons and rehabilitation specialists for people with pes cavus pain. This updated review analysed four relevant trials, but only one fully met the inclusion criteria. This trial with 154 adults showed that custom-made foot orthoses can reduce and redistribute plantar foot pressure and subsequently decrease foot pain by approximately 75%. Some biomechanical outcomes, such as pressure distribution, improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear, but many other biomechanical outcomes, such as foot alignment or muscle activity, do not improve with botulinum toxin or off-the-shelf foot orthoses, respectively. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other interventions for people with painful high-arched feet.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-27 12:41:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (17 August 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2010), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2010), AMED (January 1985 to August 2010) and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-11-01 11:35:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We included all randomized and quasi-randomised controlled trials of interventions for the treatment of pes cavus. We included trials aimed at preventing or correcting the pes cavus deformity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected papers, assessed trial quality and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-27 14:08:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Four trials were included in the review. One new trial of botulinum toxin was identified in the updated search. Only one trial of custom-made foot orthoses fully met the inclusion criteria. Three additional studies (botulinum toxin, footwear and off-the-shelf foot orthoses), all assessing secondary outcomes were included. We could not pool data used in the four studies due to heterogeneity of diagnostic groups and outcome measures. The one trial that fully met the inclusion criteria investigated the treatment of pes cavus pain in 154 adults over three months. The trial showed a significant reduction in the level of foot pain with custom-made foot orthoses versus sham orthoses (WMD 10.90; 95% CI 3.21 to 18.59). Furthermore, a significant improvement in self-reported foot function and physical functioning was reported with custom-made foot orthoses. There was no difference in reported adverse events following the allocation of custom-made or sham orthoses. Secondary biomechanical outcomes improved with the use of custom-made foot orthoses and footwear (pedobarography), but not with intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (radiographic) or off-the-shelf foot orthoses (electromyography).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-19 06:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review shows that custom-made foot orthoses are significantly more beneficial than sham orthoses for treating foot pain associated with pes cavus in a variety of clinical populations. We also show that some secondary biomechanical outcomes improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear, but not with botulinum toxin or off-the-shelf foot orthoses. There is an absence of evidence for any other type of intervention for the treatment or prevention of pes cavus.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-21 20:08:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Pes cavus is a multiplanar foot deformity characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch. It also commonly features a varus (inverted) hindfoot, a plantarflexed (downward) position of the first metatarsal, an adducted (internally directed) forefoot and claw toes. The resultant deformity is usually bilateral and rigid leading to difficulty with fitting footwear and decreased walking tolerance.</P>
<P>The term pes cavus encompasses a broad spectrum of foot deformities. Three main types of pes cavus are regularly described in the literature: pes cavovarus, pes calcaneovarus and &#8216;pure&#8217; pes cavus. Cavovarus, the most common type of pes cavus, is seen primarily in neuromuscular disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and in cases of unknown aetiology, conventionally termed as &#8216;idiopathic&#8217;. Cavovarus presents with the calcaneus in varus, the first metatarsal plantarflexed and a claw-toe deformity. In the calcaneocavus foot, which is seen primarily following poliomyelitis, the calcaneus is dorsiflexed and the forefoot is plantarflexed. In &#8216;pure&#8217; pes cavus the calcaneus is neither dorsiflexed or in varus, and is highly-arched due to a plantarflexed position of the forefoot on the rearfoot. A combination of any or all of these elements can also be seen in a &#8216;combined&#8217; type of pes cavus that may be further categorised as flexible or rigid. Despite various presentations and descriptions of pes cavus, all are characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch, gait disturbances and resultant foot pathology.<BR/>
</P>
<P>While much attention has been given to the plight of the pathological pes planus, or 'flat foot', little is known about the other extreme in foot type, the high-arched foot, or pes cavus. People with pes cavus frequently suffer foot pain, which can lead to significant disability. Despite anecdotal reports, rigorous scientific investigation of this condition and how best to manage it is lacking. This review examines the effectiveness of established and experimental interventions for the prevention and treatment of pes cavus.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology of pes cavus</HEADING>
<P>There are few good estimates of the prevalence of pes cavus. There has been only one community-based study of its prevalence in the general population. An Indian study of 1,846 healthy people aged 16 to 65 years found that 10% had high-arched feet, as assessed on static footprint (<LINK REF="REF-Sachithanandam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachithanandam 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology of pes cavus</HEADING>
<P>The aetiology and mechanisms underlying pes cavus are complex and not well understood. Factors considered influential in the development of pes cavus include muscle weakness and imbalance in neuromuscular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2005b</LINK>), residua of congenital clubfoot (<LINK REF="REF-Pandey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandey 2002</LINK>), post-traumatic bone malformations (<LINK REF="REF-Horne-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horne 1984</LINK>), peroneus longus tendon laceration (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1999</LINK>), contracture of the plantar fascia and shortening of the Achilles tendon (<LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1939</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Foot and ankle pain in pes cavus</HEADING>
<P>Individuals with pes cavus frequently report foot pain, which can lead to significant disability (<LINK REF="REF-Badlissi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badlissi 2005</LINK>). The range of complaints reported in the literature include forefoot metatarsal pain and plantar heel pain (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2005a</LINK>), pain under the sesamoid region (<LINK REF="REF-Helliwell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helliwell 1995</LINK>), painful callosities (<LINK REF="REF-Aktas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aktas 2000</LINK>), ankle arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2002</LINK>) and Achilles tendonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Giannini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannini 2002</LINK>). Other symptoms believed to be related to pes cavus include shoe-fitting problems (<LINK REF="REF-Aktas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aktas 2000</LINK>), lateral ankle instability (<LINK REF="REF-Barrie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrie 2001</LINK>), lower limb stress fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Korpelainen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korpelainen 2001</LINK>), knee pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dahle-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahle 1991</LINK>), iliotibial band friction syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>) and osteoarthritis of the hip (<LINK REF="REF-Reilly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reilly 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions for the prevention and treatment of pes cavus</HEADING>
<P>Successful prevention and treatment of pes cavus foot pain and associated disability is clinically challenging. While conservative and surgical approaches have been described in the literature, no firm evidence exists for any approach. Conservative management of people with pes cavus typically involves strategies to reduce and redistribute plantar pressure loading through the use of foot orthoses and specialised cushioned footwear (<LINK REF="REF-Statler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Statler 2005</LINK>). Other non-surgical rehabilitation approaches include stretching and strengthening of tight and weak muscles, debridement of plantar callosities and strategies to improve balance (<LINK REF="REF-Manoli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manoli 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are also numerous surgical approaches described in the literature aimed at correcting and preventing the progression of the deformity by re-balancing and reconstructing the foot. Surgical procedures fall into three main groups: (1) soft-tissue procedures (for example plantar fascia release, Achilles tendon lengthening, tendon transfer); (2) osteotomies or removing a wedge-shaped portion of the bone (for example metatarsal, midfoot or calcaneal); and (3) bone-stabilising procedures (for example triple arthrodesis, which consists of fusion of the three joints in the foot and ankle: the talocalcaneal, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid) (<LINK REF="REF-Wines-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wines 2005</LINK>). There are few reports of long-term follow-up of patients undergoing surgery for cavus foot deformities.</P>
<P>The evidence base of interventions for the prevention and treatment of pes cavus is currently weak. This review was undertaken because of the complex nature of pes cavus, the apparently high incidence of pain and chronic morbidity in people with this condition, and the limited scientific data on all aspects of its prevention and treatment.</P>

A risk of bias table was created to present a description of what was reported within the published report for each criterion and to assign a judgment relating to the risk of bias for that entry. 'Yes' indicated a low risk of bias, 'No' indicated a high risk of bias and 'Unclear' indicated an unclear or unknown risk of bias; or if an entry is not relevant to the study at hand.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-10-21 20:09:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>If there was more than one trial with a specific treatment or prevention approach we calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect across the trials using the Cochrane statistical package Review Manager. Where possible, we calculated weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all continuous outcomes, and relative risks and 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes, using a fixed-effect model.

Handsearches and contact with known experts in the field identified one unpublished study.

Three studies, published in detail in peer-reviewed journals, were excluded because they were non-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olmsted-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Olmsted 2004</LINK>) and three studies were excluded because they did not include participants with pes cavus (<LINK REF="STD-Bus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simkin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Simkin 1989</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>When we repeated the searches in August 2010, one new reference was obtained from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register, 228 from MEDLINE, 58 from EMBASE, 140 from CINAHL and 24 from AMED. EBMReviews and SPORTdiscuss were not updated because they did not identify any studies in addition to those found in the original search. Hand searches and contact with known experts in the field identified one unpublished study. Review authors JB and KL selected a total of five full-length possibly relevant studies and one unpublished study for evaluation. One published study was excluded because it was non-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Mubarak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mubarak 2009</LINK>) and four studies were excluded because they did not include participants with pes cavus (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knapik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Knapik 2010</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, five trials were identified by the authors as randomised controlled trials of interventions for the prevention or treatment of pes cavus (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kavros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kavros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). However, in one trial evaluating a pneumatic compression device (Aircast Airheel, Aircast, Inc., Summit New Jersey, USA) versus an off-the shelf orthotic device (1st Step, Wrymark, Inc., St. Louis, USA) for the treatment of heel pain in participants with a range of foot types (normal, pes cavus and pes planus), data were not provided in the published report for the subgroup of seven participants with a cavus foot type (<LINK REF="STD-Kavros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kavros 2005</LINK>). We contacted the author for additional data but he was unwilling to provide the information.</P>
<P>Only one trial fulfilled all selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>). The trial evaluated the effect of custom-made foot orthoses against sham orthoses on the level of chronic musculoskeletal foot pain three months from baseline in a community sample of 154 adults with pes cavus of mixed aetiology: 21 neuromuscular (16 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, four poliomyelitis, one polyneuropathy) and 133 idiopathic. This trial also evaluated efficacy in terms of functional change, biomechanical improvement (plantar pressure), health-related quality of life and adverse events. The custom-made foot orthoses were moulded from neutral-suspension plaster casts of the feet, and the orthoses were fabricated from 3-mm polypropylene using a computer aided design&#8211;computer-aided manufacturing milling machine to a standardised prescription that had been previously developed and pilot tested (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst a further three trials were included (<LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>), they did not fulfil all selection criteria. The three trials assessed only secondary biomechanical outcomes. Two were performed with a cross-over design with no follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>), and one with a between-legs parallel design with a 24-month follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>). Hertel et al. investigated the effect of three off-the-shelf orthotic devices (medial posted, neutral and laterally posted; Superfeet footbed orthotics, Superfeet Worldwide LLC, Ferndale, Washington, USA) against no orthotic device on surface electromyography of the quadriceps (vastus medialis and lateralis) and gluteus medius during selected exercises (squat, step down, vertical jump) in 10 healthy young adults with pes cavus (<LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>). Wegener et al. evaluated the effect of two commercially available running footwear models commonly recommended for the athlete with pes cavus: Asics Nimbus VI (Asics Oceania Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and Brooks Glycerin 3 (Texas Peak Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) against a control shoe (Dunlop Volley, Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) on in-shoe plantar pressure whilst running in 22 healthy adults (<LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>). Burns et al. tested the safety and effectiveness of 6-monthly intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type-A (Dysport, Ipsen Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia) in the posterior tibialis and peroneus longus muscles on preventing progression of pes cavus in 10 children (20 legs - <U>see analysis 2.1-2.8</U>) aged 3 to 14 years with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>). Each child had a randomly allocated treated and control leg and the trial was single blind. Primary outcome was radiographic alignment at 24-months. Secondary outcomes were objective clinical measures of foot structure, ankle flexibility and strength.</P>

<P>Only one of the randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>) investigated the treatment of pes cavus foot pain.

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>) investigated the effect of an intervention on functional improvement. In the trial of 154 participants evaluated over a follow-up period of three months, a significant improvement in foot function was reported on the Foot Health Status Questionnaire with custom-made foot orthoses compared to sham orthoses (WMD 11.00; 95% CI 3.35 to 18.65), (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The foot function domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire asks questions about how much a patient&#8217;s feet: cause difficulties with work or activities; limit the kind of work; limit walking; limit climbing stairs, on a series of 5-point scales. In the same trial physical functioning, measured with the 100-point Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36), was also shown to improve more with custom-made foot orthoses compared to the sham orthoses (WMD 9.50; 95% CI 4.07 to 14.93), (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The physical functioning domain of the SF-36 asks questions about how much a patient&#8217;s health limits: vigorous activities, such as running; moderate activities, such as cleaning the house; lifting or carrying bags of shopping; climbing a steep hill; climbing one flight of stairs; getting up from a sitting position; walking more than a kilometre; walking one hundred meters; showering or dressing. No other trial measured functional improvement (for example activities of daily living, disability measures).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Biomechanical improvement</HEADING>
<P>All four included trials reported biomechanical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>) evaluating the pressure reducing/redistributing qualities of custom-made foot orthoses versus sham reported a reduction of in-shoe plantar pressure (pressure-time integral, N.s/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) for the whole foot (WMD -2.90; 95% CI -3.62 to -2.18), rearfoot (WMD -1.20; 95% CI -1.56 to -0.84) and forefoot (WMD -1.80; 95% CI -2.59 to -1.01) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). While the custom-made foot orthoses increased midfoot plantar pressure compared to the sham, the change was not significant (WMD 0.50; 95% CI -0.02 to 1.02) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>) evaluating in-shoe plantar pressure (peak pressure (kPa), pressure-time integral (kPa.s) and force (% Body Weight), two commercial types of running footwear routinely recommended for athletes with pes cavus [Asics Nimbus VI (Asics Oceania Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and Brooks Glycerin 3 (Texas Peak Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia)] were compared to a control footwear condition (Dunlop Volley, Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) in 22 athletes running at least 20 kilometres per week. They showed that both types of running footwear significantly reduced peak plantar pressure (kPa) compared to a control shoe for all regions of the foot (whole foot, rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot) (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Furthermore, the pressure-time integral was reduced by both types of running footwear compared to the control for the whole and forefoot (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, force did not differ significantly between footwear conditions for any region of the foot (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>), the effect of three types of off-the-shelf foot orthoses (medial posted, neutral and laterally posted (Superfeet footbed orthotics, Superfeet Worldwide LLC, Ferndale, Washington, USA) compared to no orthotic condition on electromyography (percentage of maximum electromyographic activity (% Normalized iEMG)) of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and gluteus medialis was investigated in 10 healthy adults with pes cavus. Compared to the no orthotic condition, no significant changes in any of the electromyographic outcomes of muscle activity were found (<I>see </I>

In a subgroup of 16 participants with pes cavus as a result of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, custom-made foot orthoses improved mean (SD) foot pain by 26.9 (35.9) points (using the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, 0 to 100 scale) compared to 14.0 (32.4) points with the sham orthoses. In 133 participants with idiopathic pes cavus, custom-made foot orthoses improved mean foot pain by 32.0 (24.9) points versus 22.0 (21.1) points with the sham orthoses. In both subgroups, custom-made foot orthoses were more effective than the sham intervention at improving chronic musculoskeletal foot pain. Insufficient data were available for the other aetiological subgroups (four poliomyelitis, one polyneuropathy).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-26 17:34:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael Lunn">
<P>This systematic review was conducted and subsequently updated in order to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment and prevention of pes cavus. Only one trial investigated the primary outcome and four trials investigated secondary biomechanical outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Primary outcome measure</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Change in the level of foot pain three months after intervention</HEADING>
<P>The one trial evaluating this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>), showed that custom-made foot orthoses were more effective than sham orthoses at reducing foot pain in a community sample of 154 adults with pes cavus attributed to a variety of aetiologies (21 neuromuscular (16 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, 4 poliomyelitis, 1 polyneuropathy) and 133 idiopathic). Foot pain scores improved by 74% with custom-made foot orthoses compared to 43% with the sham orthoses. From the authors' experience this difference was clinically worthwhile although it does not reflect how many participants completely recovered to 'normal' levels of foot pain. Resolution of foot pain to normal levels, i.e. a score of &gt; 85 Foot Health Status Questionnaire points, was reported by 20 (27%) participants fitted with custom-made foot orthoses and 12 (15%) with sham orthoses (RR 1.76; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.34).</P>
<P>The trial was adequately powered and methodological quality was high. There was high compliance in both groups (approximately 80%) and only one participant dropped out during the three months follow-up (99% completion). However, the investigator was not blinded, which may have resulted in a risk of performance and detection (assessor) bias. In some trials, especially orthotic and footwear trials, double blinding is difficult or impossible. In this study the authors commented that blinding of the investigator was not appropriate because of the potential need for ongoing contact with the participants concerning adverse events. To reduce potential bias, many of the outcome measures were self-reported (foot pain, functional improvement and health-related quality of life) and the investigator was blinded to all data entry and processing by a research assistant not involved in participant contact. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with evidence from observational studies and expert opinion that custom-made foot orthoses are an effective treatment for cavus-related foot pain (<LINK REF="REF-Manoli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manoli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Statler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Statler 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis by aetiology demonstrated a similar effect size for custom-made foot orthoses for participants with pes cavus due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and pes cavus aetiology regarded as idiopathic. Given that the cost was US$ 87 for the custom-made foot orthoses and US$ 2 for the sham orthoses, for people presenting to the clinician with painful cavus feet, custom-made foot orthoses may be a cost-effective treatment option for chronic musculoskeletal foot pain. However, a cost-benefit analysis would be required to confirm this assertion.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Functional improvement</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>) investigated functional improvement and showed that custom-made foot orthoses were more effective than sham orthoses at improving foot function and physical functioning in 154 adults with pes cavus attributed to a variety of aetiologies. Function scores improved by 45% with custom-made foot orthoses compared to 24% with the control. As mentioned above, the trial was adequately powered and methodological quality was high, and although the chief investigator was not blinded to treatment allocation, functional improvement was self-assessed. In trials in which key outcomes are self-assessed e.g. Foot Health Status Questionnaire or Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36), the assessor was considered to be blind if the participant was blind.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Biomechanical improvement</HEADING>
<P>Painful conditions of the cavus foot and ankle are thought to be associated with abnormal pressure distribution on the plantar surface of the foot (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2005a</LINK>). Insights into the mechanism of custom-made orthotic therapy were provided by the plantar pressure data in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2006</LINK>). Overall, the custom-made foot orthoses reduced plantar pressure by 26% compared to a 9% reduction with the sham orthoses. Specifically, the custom-made orthotic device was shown to increase pressure at the midfoot and decrease pressure at the rearfoot and forefoot, supporting preliminary hypotheses that the mechanism of pain relief is by reduction and redistribution of plantar pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Redmond-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redmond 2000</LINK>). A small reduction in pressure may also have explained the improvement of foot pain in the control group receiving sham orthoses.</P>
<P>Further insight into pressure reducing interventions was examined in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wegener-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wegener 2008</LINK>). The cross-over trial investigated the effect of two popular commercially available running shoe models (Asics Nimbus VI and Brooks Glycerin 3), designed and recommended for athletes with cavus feet, on in-shoe plantar pressure distribution. In 22 athletes with a cavus foot type, peak pressures were significantly different between shoe conditions for all foot regions (whole foot, rearfoot, midfoot, forefoot). Peak pressures were reduced in both the Asics Nimbus and Brooks Glycerin compared to the control shoe (Dunlop Volley). Similar patterns were observed for pressure-time integrals, although force did not differ significant between footwear conditions. While the sample size was small, the trial was adequately powered and methodological quality was generally high. However, the investigator and the outcomes assessor were not blinded, which may have resulted in a risk of performance and detection bias respectively. Furthermore, an important methodological limitation was the cross-over design with no follow-up period. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with evidence from observational studies and expert opinion in other clinical populations, such as diabetes mellitus, that athletic footwear can modify and improve plantar pressure distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Hennig-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennig 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>An evaluation of the effects of different types of off-the-shelf foot orthoses (medial posted, neutral and laterally posted) on electromyography was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hertel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hertel 2005</LINK>). No significant differences were reported for any of the electromyographic outcomes (vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, gluteus medius). This trial was small (N = 10), and methodological quality was low, with no blinding or concealed allocation. These results provide limited insight into the effect of off-the-shelf foot orthoses for pes cavus. Further research is needed to determine the effect of any intervention on muscular activity in people with a cavus foot deformity.</P>
<P>The trial evaluating a potential preventative intervention for pes cavus in children with CMT1A (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2010</LINK>) found no measurable effect of 24-months of intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin in the tibialis posterior and peroneus longus muscles on radiographic alignment, or clinical measures of foot structure, ankle flexibility or muscle strength using highly reliable and validated age-appropriate instruments. The leg injected with botulinum toxin for 24-months had a less cavoid radiographic alignment by, on average approximately one degree, compared to the control leg. Such a small change has questionable clinical significance. This trial was small (N = 10 participants - 20 legs. See <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>), but methodological quality was high, with outcome assessor blinding and concealed allocation. This experimental trial provides some evidence that 24-months of botulinum toxin injections in the posterior tibialis and peroneus longus is safe and well-tolerated in children with CMT1A, but does not have any significant effect on the progression of the disease or foot deformity.</P>

<P>In this updated review we show that custom-made foot orthoses are significantly more beneficial than sham orthoses for treating chronic musculoskeletal foot pain associated with pes cavus in a variety of clinical populations. We also show that some secondary biomechanical outcomes, such as plantar pressure, improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear, but that foot alignment, flexibility and strength do not improve with botulinum toxin, and that upper leg electromyography does not improve with off-the-shelf foot orthoses. There is an absence of evidence for any other type of intervention for the treatment or prevention of foot pain in people with pes cavus.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the high prevalence of cavus-related foot pain and disability, more well-designed trials are needed to determine the efficacy of other therapies for patients with painful pes cavus. Common treatments of foot pain and disability requiring scientific evaluation are footwear; joint range of motion exercises; muscle stretching and strengthening; electrotherapeutic modalities; debridement of plantar callosities, medications and soft-tissue/bony surgical procedures. </P>
