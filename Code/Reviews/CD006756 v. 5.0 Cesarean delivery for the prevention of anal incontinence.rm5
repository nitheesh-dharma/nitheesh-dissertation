<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-17 13:28:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cesarean delivery (CD) is an ancient method of delivering a baby when there appears to be a risk to vaginal delivery; in most cases, a risk to the infant. However in modern times risk to the mother has also been considered in choosing this method of delivery, and increasingly the risk being considered is post partum pelvic floor dysfunction, which includes incontinence of flatus or faeces, together known as anal incontinence. In this systematic review of non-randomised studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for CD over vaginal delivery (VD) in the prevention of anal incontinence. This review encompasses 21 published studies, involving 31,698 women, delivered by 6,028 CD and by 25,170 VD. No randomised studies comparing CD to VD in average risk pregnancies exist. The above conclusion is therefore based upon less than optimal evidence.</P>

<P>Caesarean delivery (CD) is a common form of delivery of a baby, rising in frequency. One reason for its performance is to preserve maternal pelvic floor function, part of which is anal continence.</P>

<P>Search terms include: "Caesarean section, Cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, incontinence and randomised". PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) were searched from their inception through July, 2009.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-09-20 17:29:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both randomised and non-randomised studies that allowed comparisons of post partum anal continence (both fecal and flatus) in women who had had babies delivered by either CD or VD were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-11 14:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mode of delivery, and when possible mode of all previous deliveries prior to the index pregnancy were extracted, as well as assessment of continence post partum of both faeces and flatus. In Non-RCTs, available adjusted odds ratios were the primary end point sought. Incontinence of flatus is reported as a separate outcome.<BR/>Summary odds ratios are not presented as no study was analysed as a randomised controlled trial. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) are presented, that is, the number of CDs needed to be performed to prevent a single case of fecal or flatus incontinence, for each individual study. Quality criteria were developed, selecting studies that allowed maternal age adjustment, studies that allowed a sufficient time after the birth of the baby for continence assessment and studies in which mode of delivery of prior pregnancies was known. Subgroup analyses were done selecting studies meeting all quality criteria and in comparisons of elective versus emergency CD, elective CD versus VD and nulliparous women versus those delivered by VD or CD, in each case again, not calculating a summary risk statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 18:31:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twentyone reports have been found eligible for inclusion in the review, encompassing 31,698 women having had 6,028 CDs and 25,170 VDs as the index event prior to anal continence assessment . Only one report randomised women (with breech presentation) to CD or VD, but because of extensive crossing over, 52.1%, after randomisation, it was analysed along with the other 20 studies as treated, i.e. as a non-randomised trial. Only one of these reports demonstrated a significant benefit of CD in the preservation of anal continence, a report in which incontinence incidence was extremely high, 39% in CD and 48% in VD, questioning, relative to other reports, the timing and nature of continence assessment. The greater the quality of the report, the closer its Odds ratio approached 1.0. There was no difference in continence preservation in women have emergency versus elective CD.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-20 17:30:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Without demonstrable benefit, preservation of anal continence should not be used as a criterion for choosing elective primary CD. The strength of this conclusion would be greatly strengthened if there were studies that randomised women with average risk pregnancies to CD versus VD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-12 16:18:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-20 17:30:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anal incontinence may occur in women during the immediate post partum period and persist throughout adult life; indeed it is thought by some that labor and vaginal delivery are the principal causes of adult anal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Oberwalder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberwalder 2003</LINK>). It is defined as the leakage of fecal material spontaneously, solid or liquid (defining fecal incontinence) or flatus or, in many surveys, mucoid discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>). The impact of anal incontinence is dependence on protective undergarments, social isolation, and as age advances, nursing home residence (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1998</LINK>). Because of the multiple facets of anal incontinence, ascertainment and prevalence have been complex, compared to urinary incontinence (wet or not wet), leading to large variance in prevalence figures in published reports (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>), varying from 1.4% to over 11% in healthy ambulatory populations and 50% of nursing home residents (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>). The only intervention currently employed to prevent anal incontinence is elective primary Cesarean delivery.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-12 16:16:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the past decade or more there has been a lively debate concerning the health benefits of elective primary Cesarean delivery (CD) (<LINK REF="REF-Abramowitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramowitz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faridi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faridi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guise 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nygaard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nygaard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paterson_x002d_Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson-Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetterstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Idama-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idama 1999</LINK>), also known as Cesarean delivery on maternal request ((CDMR), <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>), or No indicated risk Cesarean delivery, (<LINK REF="REF-Declercq-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declercq 2005</LINK>). Evidence of the diversity of opinion even among those most expert in the field is provided by a survey in London, where 31% of female obstetricians stated that they would elect to have a CD on maternal request (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson_x002d_Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson-Brown 1998</LINK>) although in Holland the figure among female obstetricians was only 1.4% (<LINK REF="REF-van-Roosmalen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Roosmalen 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>CD rates have been steadily rising throughout high income countries and currently. CD occurs in 24.6% in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2009</LINK>) and 31.1% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Tita-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tita 2009</LINK>), a 50% rise in the USA in 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>). Yet, in the Netherlands it remains 9% (<LINK REF="REF-van-Roosmalen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Roosmalen 1999</LINK>). CDMR is a component of the rising rate of CD (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>) in the United States.</P>
<P>Many reasons are given for a woman choosing to have a CDMR. In Taiwan timing of delivery to certain days of the week is associated with life long good fortune for the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 2008</LINK>). Women in Brazil believe that this more aggressive and sophisticated intervention is better for the health of the baby, and that is better medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Behague-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behague 2002</LINK>). Economic correlates with CDMR rates are evident in Brazil and Chile, where CD occurs more than twice as often in private patients, exceeding 70% of all deliveries in wealthier classes.(<LINK REF="REF-Behague-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behague 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2000</LINK>). However the most common reason stated for CDMR is preservation of maternal pelvic floor function, such as continence of urine, faeces, flatus and prevention of pelvic floor prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Nygaard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nygaard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-01-12 16:16:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cesarean delivery may prevent anal incontinence as it may preserve and protect maternal pelvic floor function by avoiding direct vaginal, sphincter and distal pelvic nerve trauma that might occur during vaginal delivery (VD).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-01-12 16:18:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>However, Cesarean delivery (CD) is associated with a number of health risks when compared to Vaginal delivery (VD), including transfusion, ICU admission, hysterectomy and extended length of hospital stay. (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2007</LINK>). In the subsequent pregnancies, there is an increased likelihood of a repeat CD and the rate of vaginal birth after CD is decreasing (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greene-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mollison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollison 2005</LINK>). After CD there is an increased, if small, risk in the subsequent pregnancy of uterine rupture, placenta praevia, placenta accreta and operative morbidity including peripartum hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Landon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makoha-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makoha 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guise 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>). The risk of intraperitoneal adhesions is increased with each CD, up to 83% in the third pregnancy, increasing the difficulty of the procedure and the risk of subsequent adhesive bowel obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Morales-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 2007</LINK>). Thromboembolism is increased following CD (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2004</LINK>). There are also risks for the newborn, especially if the elective CD occurs before the recommended 39 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Tita-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tita 2009</LINK>). Yet in the USA more than 50% of CD occur before the 39th week of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Tita-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tita 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>). This risk pulmonary difficulties in the newborn may last well into childhood, as the risk of asthma in 8 year olds has been found to be higher if they were born by CD (<LINK REF="REF-Roduit-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roduit 2009</LINK>). There is also the question of cost (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2001</LINK>). In the UK it is estimated that the cost of a CD is 760 pounds more than a VD (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1999</LINK>). Post partum readmission to hospital is more common after CD than VD ( <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>). Awareness of these risks has led insurers in the United States to increase medical insurance costs to those women having prior CDs (<LINK REF="REF-Grady-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 2008</LINK>). The National Institute of Clincal Excellence (NICE) of the UK has recommended that CDMR not be done (<LINK REF="REF-Kmietowicz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kmietowicz 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>An intervention such as CD should require rigorous evidence of efficacy in the preservation of anal continence before that specific indication can be accepted or promoted as a reason for its choice.</P>

<P>The timing of the measurement of the outcome was considered to be optimally more than 4 months. This timing was based upon a general belief among colorectal surgeons that sphincter control is less than normal in the presence of a healing wound such as an episiotomy, but more importantly from two pairs of publications in which incontinence rates were higher in women who were assessed at 3 months post partum than in the same women assessed several years later (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>).

<P>The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (see Appendix C) to assess RCTs: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, providers and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias.</P>
<P>However, because of the inclusion of non RCTs in this review additional risk of bias measures were included for the following items:</P>
<P>prospective cohort study design,</P>
<P>adjustment for age (the most significant risk factor for anal incontinence)</P>
<P>and parity (increasing parity thought to increase anal incontinence risk),</P>
<P>pregnancy and delivery history (to assure that those categorized as CD had not had a prior VD),</P>
<P>analysing emergency and elective CD separately (i.e., those mothers in labor or not), and</P>
<P>the timing of the assessment of outcomes after more than 4 months post partum (to assure that sustained incontinence was being assessed). Four months is an inadequate length of time for perineal healing and recovery of function, especially when there has been perineal trauma related either to the birth itself or episiotomy. Anal seepage and sphincter dysfunction are common during perineal wound healing, so that incontinence at 4 months has not been a good predictor of incontinence at 6 months, one year or six years (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>).</P>

Adjustment for parity was made in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>). The cohort presented by (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>) were primiparas at registration in 1995, and all subsequent deliveries were by the same mode in each cohort as the original delivery, either VD or by CD. Vaginal delivery patients were excluded if they had an instrumented delivery (by suction or forceps). Ten year follow up data with continence assessment are presented. The Hannah trial only included breech presentations (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>).

</P>
<P>
<I>RCTs:</I> There is only one trial that randomised women to CD or VD, but there were aspects of that report that limited the ability ana lyze it as randomised and to generalize its results to all pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>). Firstly, only breech presentations were included, secondly only 50 per cent of the women were primiparous and finally prior VD was not a contraindication to randomisation to CD, creating a potential classification error. Because of the breech nature of the pregnancies, there was a 43% cross over amongst the VD arm of the study to CD at the time of birth due to the obstetrician's judgment, and a 9.1% cross over from the CD arm to VD, for a total cross over of 52.1%.</P>
<P>The study by Eason is also a randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eason 2002</LINK>) but not randomisation to VD or CD, rather to perineal massage in the 3rd trimester. What is presented related to continence is a nested cohort within this trial that looked at different delivery methods and how they affected defecation function postpartum. Only 60 per cent of the patients were primiparous and continence assessment was also done three months after delivery.</P>
<P>Four of these reports present follow-up data or analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>) on previously published cohorts (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guise-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2007</LINK>).

<I>Population Studies: </I>The population based surveys by <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fornell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fornell 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fritel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fritel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Melville-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Melville 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK> assessed continence at a time quite remote from pregnancy and delivery. A very large cross sectional population survey presented by MacArthur (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>) presents follow-up data on and analyses from a multi-continental cohort that, in the initial report (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>) only had a three month continence assessment. That original study included 7879 post partum women. At the six year follow-up, with 4214 women from the original cohort responding and matched to their original data were assessed. Age adjustment was available within some of these cohorts and it is also known within the group which patients having CD and had no prior VD. Although the first publication of the RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>) made the assessment less than 4 months, the two year follow-up of that study has been published with subsequent continence data on 917 of the original 2088 enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Overall assessment of risk of bias:</I> As only two studies were RCTs, the assessment of risk of bias did not apply to the majority of the studies. In the methods the pre stated assessment of quality included studies that reported prospective data from cohorts, adjusted for age, considered parity, separated elective and emergent CD and reported the outcomes after 4 months. Seven studies were judged to be of greater quality based upon these criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melville-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Melville 2005</LINK>). Among these 7 studies only one was also a prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>), providing more reliable incidence data and thus avoiding recall bias related to prevalence.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-01-12 16:38:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reported crude incontinence rates varied greatly between reports from 1.14% (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>) to 25.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>) to 48% (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>). This variation is troubling. Variation is also often seen in prevalence studies, where apparently similar populations report widely varying rates of anal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>), but in no case in those reports was it as high as in the reports cited above. This may be due to variations in ascertainment techniques and the age of the assessed populations. For instance the (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>) participants had just had babies and were clearly much younger than those assessed in (<LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>), who were between 40 and 69 years old. Yet in a similarly aged population to <LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fornell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fornell 2004</LINK> presents fecal incontinence prevalence as low as 1% for solid faeces in urinary continent women. Further discussion of problems related to disease ascertainment is presented in Discussion. Comparison of rates across studies are therefore not done, though comparative rates within studies, especially when age adjustment is performed, should be more reliable than rates across studies. Results for each of the outcomes are shown in the Forest plots. In addition, summary statistics of effect are not reported as these are all non-randomised studies, or in one case, a randomised study reported as treated (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>) because of a cross over rate of 52.1% after randomisation.</P>

<P>Faeces</P>
<P>1.11 Of the 22 studies shown in Forest plot 1.1, fecal incontinence by delivery mode, only two show a significant protective effect of CD (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>). The (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>) assessed continence only 3 months post partem and in a follow up study of the same participants, the difference in prevalence of incontinence comparing CD and VD disappeared (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>) (OR=1.04, 0.72-1.50), an effect also seen in comparing the early and late reports of (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>). (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>) is a subset of (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2007</LINK>), the primiparous mothers from that survey, with adjustment for age, many delivery related factors and exclusion of women who reported an anal incontinence prior to the pregnancy, allowing a calculation of incidence. Also unlike the 2007 study, the more recent publication allows direct comparison of CD and VD. The protective effect of CD was very significant (OR=0.7, 0.62-0.78) and the population large (5491), apparently giving great weight to the study. However the continence assessment tool used, the "NIH definition" of incontinence, merged both flatus and faeces. Any episode of incontinence since delivery up to three months was queried and apparently even a single episode in the early post-partum period would classify that mother as incontinent. The incidence of incontinence in CD was 39% and in VD, 48%, levels of incontinence otherwise only seen in nursing homes (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1998</LINK>). All other included studies showed prevalence numbers, despite their variation, much smaller than this, some less than 1%, especially for CD (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 2001</LINK>). This adds great emphasis to the importance of continence assessment at a time remote from the delivery of the baby. In addition it also stresses the need for an assessment tool that can be more uniformly utilized in future studies and especially one that discloses a sustained disorder rather than a single event at a traumatic time.</P>
<P>Flatus</P>
<P>1.2 There are no studies that show a significant benefit of CD over VD with regard to incontinence of flatus. As mentioned above, two studies merged flatus and faeces into a single outcome variable (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 2003</LINK>) and the data from both these studies has been entered in comparison 1.1, incontinence of faeces.</P>

A validated instrument for the detection of anal incontinence was used in four of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melville-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Melville 2005</LINK>). None of these studies showed a significant benefit of CD over VD and aside from (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>), the odds ratios are closely clustered around 1.0.</P>
<P>2.2   Emergency CD versus Elective CD</P>
<P>Six studies allowed comparison of elective versus emergent CD (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guise-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>). An important factor in separating the effects of pregnancy from labor is whether the CDs were done electively or in a women in labor, emergently. MacArthur presents only 3 month continence data for primips. (Odds Ratio for fecal incontinence = 0.99; 95 per cent confidence interval = 0.62-1.52) and all women (1.14; 0.49-2.65) (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>), and Abramov (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>) a more prolonged follow-up in discordant twins (1.07; 0.05-24.1). (<LINK REF="STD-Lal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 2003</LINK>) had an OR of 1.57; CI 0.381-6.486, among 184 women having either emergent or elective CDs and (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1997</LINK>) had an OR of 0.134; CI=0.007-2.428. In none of these studies was there a significant difference in fecal incontinence between women having emergency or elective CDs. For (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2007</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>, looking only at primiparous mothers from the 2007 population), the odds ratios were 0.92; 0.57-1.51 and 1.20; 0.92-1.56 respectively.</P>
<P>2.3   Elective CD versus VD</P>
<P>Four studies presented analyses that compare elective CD versus VD (<LINK REF="STD-Abramov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abramov 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>), again addressing the same issue raised in comparison 2.2, whether combining elective and emergent CD in comparisons to VD might obscure a benefit of CD when done electively. There was no significant advantage of elective CD over VD in any of these four studies.</P>
<P>2.4 The association of pregnancy delivered by any method with fecal incontinence compared to women who have never delivered a baby is shown in this Forest plot. These are derived from the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fritel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fritel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melville-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Melville 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>), encompassing 1796 nulliparous women and 7686 women who have had a baby by any delivery method. (<LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 2006</LINK>) both show a significant increase in risk of fecal incontinence in parous women.</P>
<P>The number needed to treat results are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. There was great variation between studies, in some cases with inverted numbers, that is VDs would have to be done to prevent a case of anal incontinence relative to CD (negative numbers in the Table). Summary calculations are not presented for two reasons. First summary risk data are not calculated since all included studies are observational studies. Second the prevalence risk of incontinence in the control population (VD) varied widely between studies suggesting cultural/methodological/clinical differences in these studies that would make them hard to compare. The internal validity within each study of the VD/CD comparison and NNT should not be affected by this variation.</P>
<P>The fecal incontinence prevalence decreased in follow-up studies for instance from 9.6% (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>) in the whole cohort at 3 months to 3.6% (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>) at 6 years The same disappearance of an apparent insignificant benefit of CD in preservation of anal continence was found in the follow up study of the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>). In the (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>) study and the mothers of twins study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 2003</LINK>), there was an insignificant trend towards increased incontinence risk with CD (see NNT in Additonal Tables). Among the studies where follow-up is also published, data from both the initial reports and longer follow up data are presented in the Forest plots for (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>From the available evidence there is no demonstrable benefit of CD, apparently any CD and not just CDMR, in the preservation of anal continence.</P>
<P>But why doesn't CD prevent anal incontinence, especially when associating perineal trauma with loss of bowel control is not just intuitive, but sometimes visibly obvious? Certain aspects of VD are clearly causally related to anal incontinence: significant laceration, forceps, and some episiotomies (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetterstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterstrom 1999</LINK>). However this review demonstrates that other factors need to be explored. So one must look to pregnancy and not just labor and delivery as an initiating factor. Further evidence in favour of this comes from the sphincter repair literature cited below. The rapid decay in function suggests that another defect is present besides a gap in the sphincter that remains after the early effects of sphincter repair wear off. What this is is not yet known, though trauma at the pelvic inlet during pregnancy or in early labor (<LINK REF="REF-Devine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devine 1999</LINK>) seems likely.</P>

<P>Many of the included reports are small studies that may not have had sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a benefit. However, the number of deliveries in some reports was quite large. Meta-analysis is a technique that could combine these results and, among other accomplishments, overcome the problem of inadequate power by performing a combined analysis of multiple studies and so increase sample size. However, the study design needed to minimize bias in meta-analysis is the randomised controlled trial. Bias is more likely in non-randomized studies, in this review most likely related to subject allocation to treatment group. Women having a CD may have been on average more likely to have bigger babies, or problems during their labor, though two studies did adjust for all labor related factors (<LINK REF="STD-Eason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eason 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>) and the former still found that CD did not prevent anal incontinence. The latter (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>) would benefit from a follow up study more remote in time from delivery and with an alternative assessment tool that might better disclose sustained incontinence. Nor do the data shown comparing emergency CD to elective CD support the latter point. The former issue of fetal weight is not supported in the analysis of data from (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2001</LINK>), in which birth weight was not found to be a predictor of anal incontinence, though in (<LINK REF="STD-Guise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guise 2008</LINK>) newborn weight was a predictor of incontinence in the VD group, a group again that had an anal incontinence incidence of 48%.</P>
<P>This is a very significant public health issue affecting all women of birthing age. CD rates in some countries approach 50 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Shorten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorten 2007</LINK>). That a randomised trial of average risk pregnancies has not yet been done suggests that such trials will not be done soon if ever. Several reports have explored why this is the case (<LINK REF="REF-Kotaska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavender-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tilbrook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilbrook 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PCRG-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCRG 2008</LINK>), all suggesting that the clinical situation is too complex and that preconceived preferences and biases among both patients and doctors would make randomisation nearly impossible. Yet in an even more complex clinical situation, breech presentation, a randomised trial has been done (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>). Similar trials should be done among women with average risk pregnancies and hopefully with many fewer crossovers between VD and CD. It is only in this way that the separate effects of pregnancy and delivery on maternal pelvic floor function can be determined.</P>
<P>The next level of evidence is the prospective cohort study, a design that might provide the opportunity to establish a baseline continence status before pregnancy, labor or delivery and thus in the post partum continence assessments establish incidence rather than prevalence and so establish pregnancy factors as the etiology of the incontinence. There are six such cohorts within this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eason 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2002</LINK>; Pinta 2004a; <LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>; Sultan 1993a), two of which included pre partum anal continence evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1999</LINK>; Pinta 2004a). The greatest advantage of the prospective cohort design is in studies for instance of dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer.  The intervention is recorded prospectively and so was precise - as dietary recall is notoriously inaccurate, and outcome also recorded as incidence, since the cohort would be ideally assured as disease free at inception by for instance an entrance colonoscopy. Subsequent disease onset is unlikely to be missed, as untreated it is lethal.  In colorectal cancer studies polyps were often substituted for cancer, since investigators didn't have the patience or money to wait for cancer to occur.  Polyps were thought to be good surrogates for cancer, though they have since been proven to be imperfect, especially since most polyps never evolve into cancer.  So, to CD.  The intervention here is CD vs. VD.  It is unlikely that a woman does not accurately recall how her baby was born, each one, and if she had stitches versus no stitches and maybe even elective versus in labor. </P>
<P>Is outcome assessment more like to be better obtained in a prospective cohort than in a population based cross sectional survey? We have already written that sustained anal incontinence is the outcome of interest rather than transient dysfunction in the post-partum period. Assurance that a woman was symptom free before pregnancy and before delivery would allow determination of incidence rather than prevalence and thus diminish the bias that might arise from varying prevalence in different groups. This may be better than recall years later, if earlier symptoms were assessed at all, which they were only in a minority of the included studies. Recall in this regard has not been rigorously assessed.</P>
<P>In addition, a healing perineum, even if unlacerated - just stretched, may be prone to dysfunction, but in the context of this review, it is often transitory.  Ascertainment at a time remote from delivery is key to determining if CD is protective. The prospective cohorts included in this review haven't, aside from (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 2007</LINK>), done that.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-11 13:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A meta-analysis of published reports that assessed anal sphincter integrity after vaginal delivery and correlated this with continence stated that 77%-83% (depending on parity) of anal incontinence in parous women was due to sphincter disruption (<LINK REF="REF-Oberwalder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberwalder 2003</LINK>). Three things are implied by this conclusion: first, that those not suffering sphincter disruption due to VD, specifically men, children, and nulliparous women, or women having CD, all being equally exposed to all other risk factors for anal incontinence, have a much lower risk of anal incontinence than women who have had a VD. There is scant epidemiologic evidence that this is the case (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>). Second, it is implied that sphincter repair would be effective treatment for anal incontinence in almost all women whose incontinence follows a VD. Yet repair of disrupted sphincter has less than a perfect track record. Even more importantly, there is a reported rapid decay in function after repair that is far too great to be explained by age alone (<LINK REF="REF-Goffeng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffeng 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Guttierz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guttierz 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Halverson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halverson 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Karoui-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karoui 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Malouf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouf 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pinta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinta 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rothbart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothbart 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vaizey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaizey 2004</LINK>). Third, if direct trauma to the anal sphincter (and not intra-pelvic nerves) were the major cause of anal incontinence, then CD should be effective in preventing incontinence. This review has shown that this is not the case.</P>
<P>An earlier version of this review as published based upon 16 reported studies and with largely the same conclusions as stated herein (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Urinary incontinence has not been investigated in a Cochrane review though one systematic review has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Press-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 2007</LINK>). Sustained urinary incontinence in the studies analyzed also, as in this report, did not differ by birth mode. As with this review, this conclusion was based upon observational epidemiologic studies alone.</P>

<P>No benefit for CD over VD can be demonstrated in this review of 21 non-randomized studies. Elective primary CD in average risk women when done for the preservation of anal continence cannot be recommended. Average risk is the key factor. No doubt there are women who, due to previous trauma or pelvic reconstruction, cannot risk further trauma to the sphincter and for whom CD is appropriate. There is no evidence in included studies that such women constituted a significant number of women having CD, which could lead to a bias in favor of VD, and this situation would have been excluded in most of the best studies. In any case the results of this review state that based upon current evidence, a pregnant woman cannot be told that by having a CD she can reliably avoid anal incontinence.</P>

<P>No adequate randomised trial of CD versus VD in average risk pregnancies with postpartum assessment of pelvic floor function, with the assessment done at an appropriate time and using an assessment tool to determine function properly has been done. Cross overs were the problem in the Term Breech Trial, a problem that should be avoidable in average risk pregnancies. There is no other issue in medicine that can approach the magnitude of this in size of population affected, cost and potential morbidity.</P>
