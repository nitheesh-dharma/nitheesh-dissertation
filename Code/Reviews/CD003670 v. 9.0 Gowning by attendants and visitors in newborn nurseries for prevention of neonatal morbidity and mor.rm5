<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Newborn nurseries and neonatal intensive care units often require staff and visitors to wear overgowns with the intention of preventing the spread of infection. It has also been thought that putting on an overgown will remind people to wash their hands, which is of proven importance in preventing infection. A review of the medical literature identified eight clinical trials on gowning in these settings, involving 3811 newborns. Infection rates, death rates, or the length of stay of infants were not significantly affected by wearing gowns. Only two of the trials were considered to be of good quality, and there was variation between trials regarding gowning policies. Gowning did not increase the rate of handwashing. There is no evidence to support the use of gowning by staff to prevent the spread of infection. Based on these studies, gowning may not be a cost effective policy. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Overgowns are widely used in newborn nurseries and neonatal intensive care units. It is thought that gowns may help to prevent the spread of nosocomial infection and serve as a reminder to staff and visitors to wash their hands before contact with the infant. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the effects of the wearing of an overgown by attendants and visitors on the incidence of infection and death in infants in newborn nurseries.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-11 15:19:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1950 - January 2009), Embase (1950 - January 2009) and CINAHL (1982 - January 2009).</P>
<P>This search was updated in December 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The review includes all published trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation, in which overgowns worn by attendants or visitors were compared with no overgowns worn by attendants or visitors.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-03-16 10:20:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. Data extraction and study quality were independently assessed by the two review authors. Missing information was sought from three authors, but only one responded. Results are expressed as relative risk or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals .</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-11 15:18:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials were included, reporting outcomes for 3,811 infants. Trial quality varied, with only two assessed as being of good quality. Not wearing overgowns was associated with a trend to reduction in the death rate (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02) compared to wearing overgowns, but these results did not reach statistical significance. There was no statistically significant effect of gowning policy on incidence of systemic nosocomial infection, (typical RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.71). The overall analysis showed no significant effects of gowning policy on the incidence of colonisation, length of hospital stay or handwashing frequency. No trials of visitor gowning were found.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from this systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate that overgowns are effective in limiting death, infection or bacterial colonisation in infants admitted to newborn nurseries. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-18 11:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Newborn infants, particularly those admitted to neonatal intensive care units, are at risk for a variety of bacterial, viral and fungal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Gaynes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaynes 1996</LINK>). Neonatal infection carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality, especially among very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Barton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 1999</LINK>). Reasons for higher rates of infection amongst newborns includes their lowered ability to resist disease agents (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1999</LINK>), exposure to endemic nursery pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Foca-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foca 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1994</LINK>), prolonged use of central venous catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Chathas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chathas 1990</LINK>) and exposure to intrauterine infections (<LINK REF="REF-Seaward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaward 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Organisms introduced into the nursery may be transmitted to other infants by a variety of routes making cross infection a particular problem (<LINK REF="REF-Baltimore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baltimore 1998</LINK>). A colonised or infected infant has the potential to impact on the colonisation or infection rates in particular time periods. Handwashing is recognised as the single most effective method of reducing the transmission of microorganisms between patients (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1999</LINK>) and is an integral part of hospital infection control programs. Other practices, such as various barrier methods, are also used to control cross infection in hospitals. Gowning is one barrier method of infection control frequently used to restrict the transmission of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Cloney-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloney 1986</LINK>). It is common practice for attendants and visitors to wear overgowns in some neonatal intensive care nurseries. For attendants, this is to prevent patient-to-patient transmission of microorganisms and infection; for visitors, it is to protect newborns from organisms which they may carry. Although wearing overgowns is believed to increase compliance with hand washing, one non-controlled study has not demonstrated this effect (<LINK REF="REF-Donowitz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donowitz 1987</LINK>). In recent times, cost considerations have led some institutions to abandon the use of overgowns in newborn nurseries (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although many centres use overgowns for attendants and visitors as a means of infection control in newborn nurseries and neonatal intensive care units, the benefits and risks of gowning remain unclear.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by each review author taking account of blinding at randomisation, intervention and outcome measurement and completeness of follow up. Additional information was sought from three trial authors. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2011, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed &#8220;partial&#8221; was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear. </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group were used. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager software.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-02-16 08:58:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials which allocated clusters of patients to each intervention were not analysed using the number of clusters as the unit of analysis, as intended in the protocol, but analysed as if the allocation was by individual. This was necessary because none of the authors of these trials used the cluster as the unit of analysis. Analysing cluster trials in this way has the potential to over-estimate the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Mollison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollison 2000</LINK>). Consequently, for each outcome there is a meta-analysis of all trials and also of two subgroups where appropriate, one which includes the trials which randomised the individual participant and one which includes the cluster allocated trials. </P>

<P>Three of the studies randomised by individual infants. Each of these was conducted in a well baby, full-term nursery (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>). In two of these studies, rooming in was practiced and infants spent only short periods of time in the nursery (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>). Methods used in the three studies were similar with staff and visitors in the control arm using gowns and those in the experimental arm not wearing gowns. In both groups, infection control precautions such as handwashing before entering the nursery and before and after handling infants were observed.</P>
<P>Five studies used cluster allocation by alternating blocks of time for the gown and no-gown periods, in either neonatal intensive care or special care nurseries (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). In the gowning time periods, gowns were worn by all staff and visitors on entering the nursery and for all infant contacts. In the no-gown time periods, there were between study variations in how 'gowning' was defined. In the earlier studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>), gowns were not worn when entering the nursery but they were worn if the incubator hood was opened or when an infant was being held. In the two later studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>), gowns were not used at all during the no-gown periods. In the <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK> trial, gowns were defined as a plastic apron.</P>
<P>Alternate time periods used in each study were two or three-month blocks and the length of studies varied between eight to 25 months. One study attempted to eliminate exposure effects from one time period to another by excluding infants who were admitted in the last 10 days of each two month interval (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>). Adjustment for seasonal biases was made in a further study where the gowning period was extended for one month at the end of the first 12 months to ensure a different distribution of gowning periods in the second year (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>). One study provided evidence of community follow-up to establish if any infections had occurred after hospital discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Each infant was allocated to the gowning and no-gowning groups according to the gowning policy in place during the month the infant was admitted and outcomes for that infant were attributed to the gowning policy as allocated on admission.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK> reported nasal and umbilical colonisation rates by day of life for the gown and no-gown groups (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK> on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14 and 21 and <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK> on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 21 and 28). We chose day four results for the meta-analysis to ensure that colonisation was hospital acquired (i.e. acquired more than 48 hours after admission) and to maximise the number included in the sample (i.e. it was not until day 10 when similar days were again used for reporting and by this time, many of the infants had been discharged). Groin swabs were also analysed using day four results (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Effect by visitors and attendants</B>
<BR/>None of the studies reported on independent effects of wearing gowns by either visitors or attendants. All of the included studies focused on comparisons when both the visitors and attendants wore or did not wear gowns.</P>

<P>
<B>Concealment of allocation</B>
<BR/>There was adequate concealment of allocation in two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>), each randomising the individual patient. One used shuffled sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>) and the second used consecutively numbered sealed envelopes that contained a folded card with the group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>). No information was provided for the allocation technique used by <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>, but it is stated that infants were randomly assigned to one of two full term nurseries. None of the trials using cluster allocation used randomly allocated periods for the intervention; all use pre-determined two or three month blocks.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>Blinding of the intervention was not possible. Blinding of outcome assessment was reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Completeness of follow up</B>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK> study, there was no indication of how many infants were randomised on admission to either the gown or no-gown groups. Infants were excluded if they did not have nose and umbilical cultures taken within six hours of delivery or if they did not have cultures taken before discharge. This makes the possibility of attrition bias likely. <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK> enrolled 234 infants in the no-gown group and 239 infants in the gown group. Length of stay was the only outcome calculated using these numbers. Infection and colonisation data were reported on 222 infants and 230 infants respectively. In the <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK> trial, follow-up data are complete for infection but not for colonisation. There were also incomplete colonisation data in the <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> trials.<BR/>

<P>Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and reported on 3,811 infants who were cared for by attendants who wore or did not wear gowns.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>PRIMARY OUTCOMES </B>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Death before discharge (Outcome 1.1):</B>
<BR/>The death rate was reported in all the cluster allocation trials, each conducted in intensive care settings (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>). None of the trials found a statistically significant effect on death. The meta-analysis was confined to four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). Overall, not wearing a gown was associated with a trend towards reduction in death rate (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.00), but these results did not reach statistical significance. The death rate as reported by <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> was similar between groups (0.44 per 100 patient days in the no gown periods and 0.51 per 100 patient days in the gown periods). Due to the way in which they were reported, these data could not be included in the meta-analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Systemic nosocomial infection (Outcome 1.2):</B>
<BR/>Five cluster allocation trials reported information on systemic infection (septicaemia, meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumonia) (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>) reported only meningitis or septicaemia confirmed by postmortem examination. None of the trials found a statistically significant effect on the incidence of systemic nosocomial infection. The meta-analysis, confined to four trials not including <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>, found no significant effect on systemic nosocomial infection (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.23)]. Substantial heterogeneity was found in this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 57.1%) so a random effects model was used for the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> also provided data for systemic infections (no gowning period 1.38 infections per 100 patient days; gowning period 1.21 infections per 100 patient days); the difference was not statistically significant. Due to the way in which they were reported, the data of <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> could not be included in the meta-analysis.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Localised nosocomial infection (Outcome 1.3):</B>
<BR/>Four studies were identified that evaluated localised nosocomial infection. Two were trials that randomised the individual patient (<LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>). These showed no statistically significant effect (typical RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.86). Two were cluster allocation trials <LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>). These also showed no significant effect on localised nosocomial infection (typical RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.00). The overall estimate for the four studies showed no significant effect (typical RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.71).</P>
<P>
<B>SECONDARY OUTCOMES</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Colonisation:</B>
<BR/>The methods used to collect and process swabs were similar, but the days on which swabs were taken varied between studies. Two of the trials limited their investigation to staphylococcal carriage (<LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>) and one to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage (MRSA) (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK> study, the site of colonisation was not noted but carriage rates were similar between groups (no-gown group 4/1002 MRSA positive swabs, gown group 6/904 MRSA positive swabs).</P>
<P>
<B>Nasal colonisation (Outcome 1.4):</B>
<BR/>Nasal colonisation data was compared in six of the eight included studies. Three trials that randomised the individual patient (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>) found no significant differences in nasal colonisation rates (typical RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18). There was also no significant effect seen in the two cluster trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>) (typical RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07). When the results of all five trials were combined in an overall meta-analysis, there was no significant effect (typical RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88, 1.09). In the <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> trial the number of swabs taken was used as the denominator with no indication of how many infants were swabbed. There were no significant differences in the rate of positive cultures between the no-gowning and gowning periods (no-gown group 179/375 positive swabs; gown group 208/351 positive swabs).</P>
<P>
<B>Umbilical colonisation (Outcome 1.5):</B>
<BR/>Six trials provided data on umbilical colonisation. Those randomising by individual (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>) showed no significant effect on this outcome (typical RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93, 1.14). Results from two of the cluster allocation trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>) also showed no significant difference on this outcome (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12). When results from the five trials were combined, the result was not significant (typical RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10). The other cluster allocation trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>) reported similar proportions of positive cultures among the total cultures taken (no-gown group 92/213 positive swabs; gown group 86/167 positive swabs).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Eye colonisation (Outcome 1.6):</B>
<BR/>One study using random allocation by individual (<LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>) collected data on eye colonisation. No significant difference was found between the no-gowned and gowned groups (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05).</P>
<P>
<B>Groin colonisation (Outcome 01.07):</B>
<BR/>One of the trials that randomised by individual, reported collected data on groin colonisation (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>). Gowning policy did not significantly effect this outcome (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.57).</P>
<P>
<B>Stool colonisation:</B>
<BR/>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>) there was a significant difference in the rate of stool colonisation between the no-gown (84/372) and the gown groups (48/346). A total of 718 cultures were taken from 230 infants, so it is unknown how many repeat cultures were taken from each infant with a positive culture result.</P>
<P>
<B>Cost:</B>
<BR/>The cost of wearing gowns was estimated in three of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK> included an estimate of the annual cost of gowning (nursing time, cost of gown laundering and maintenance) and calculated that the cost of time alone was equivalent to employing more than one full time equivalent nurse for one year. <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK> compared the cost of gowns used in the no-gowning period with those used in the gowning period. During the gowning period, the average number of gowns used was 312 per day compared with 177 per day in the no-gowning periods. Gowns were defined as plastic aprons and cost Singapore $0.05 each. This resulted in a cost difference of S$1,696 per annum. <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK> concluded that the projected annual cost savings associated with discontinuing gowns would be approximately $US 8,000 per annum.</P>
<P>
<B>Handwashing:</B>
<BR/>One cluster allocation trial compared handwashing frequency between the no-gowning and gowning time periods (<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>). Direct observation at an infant's bedside three times weekly for 30 minutes was used to collect data. A sample of 87 contacts were observed in the no-gowning period and 34 infant contacts during the gowning period. The rate of hand wash compliance was similar in the two groups (no gowning 60%, gowning 62%, p = 0.84).</P>
<P>
<B>Length of hospital stay (Outcome 1.8):</B>
<BR/>Length of hospital stay in a well baby nursery was measured in three trials randomising the individual (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK> study, hospital stay was similar in both groups, (MD 0.40 days, 95% CI -5.82 to 6.62). The number of in-patient days did not differ significantly in either the <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK> trial (no gown 9.0 days, gown 8.5 days) or the <LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK> trial (no gown 2.81 days, gown 2.84 days). Standard deviations were unavailable for these two studies, preventing inclusion of these data in the outcome table.</P>
<P>
<B>ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES FOR PRETERM INFANTS:</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Duration of mechanical ventilation (Outcome 1.9):<BR/>
</B>One cluster allocation trial included results on the duration of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). The number of ventilator days was similar for infants admitted during the no-gowning and gowning time periods (MD 5.00 days, 95% CI -11.09 to 21.09).</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of neonatal intensive care nursery stay:<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> measured length of stay in a neonatal nursery environment. The mean length of stay between the no-gown and gown groups was not statistically different (no-gowning periods: mean number of days = 15; gowning periods: mean number of days = 20).</P>
<P>
<B>Antibiotic use in preterm infants:<BR/>
</B>None of the trials provided data for this outcome</P>
<P>
<B>OTHER OUTCOMES<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>Nursery traffic:</B>
<BR/>In a cluster allocation trial, <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK> used two 15-minute observation periods to monitor the number of people entering the nursery. The patterns of traffic were identical during the no-gown and gown periods with an average of 10 entries during each 15-minute observation period.</P>
<P>
<B>Post discharge follow-up:</B>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK> study, 83 from the no-gown group and 81 infants in the gown group were able to be followed up four weeks after discharge. Within this time, one infant from the no-gowning group was treated for conjunctivitis and one infant from the gowning group required hospitalisation for a viral infection.</P>
<P>
<B>SUBGROUP ANALYSIS:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Effect by nursery type:</B>
<BR/>All of the trials that randomised the individual patient were conducted in well-baby nurseries and all of the cluster allocation trials were undertaken in neonatal intensive care units. Thus, the analyses of sub-categories for trials randomising the individual are synonymous with well-baby nurseries and sub-categories for cluster allocation trials are synonymous with neonatal intensive care units.</P>
<P>
<B>Effect by gestational age at birth:</B>
<BR/>We intended to investigate the effects of wearing gowns for subgroups of newborn infants by gestational age; however, none of the trials reported outcomes specifically by gestational age so this analysis could not be done.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Effect by visitors and attendants:</B>
<BR/>There were no eligible studies reporting the independent effect of visitors or attendants wearing gowns on the study outcomes.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-16 11:29:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since overgowns are widely used in neonatal units, it was surprising that the evidence supporting their efficacy was limited. Of the eight studies meeting our inclusion criteria, three used the individual as the unit of allocation, but one of these did not describe the method used for allocation concealment. The nature of the study prevented blinding of the intervention and there was limited reporting of blinding of outcome assessment. Five of the studies had incomplete follow-up data on one or more of the outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Agbayani-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Agbayani 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forfar-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Forfar 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>) and there was evidence of post-randomisation exclusions in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Birenbaum-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Birenbaum 1990</LINK>). Sample size calculations were absent in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among the five cluster allocation trials there were a number of methodological variations that made comparisons difficult. In one study, colonisation rates were reported as outcomes per swab rather than per infant, leading to non-independence of multiple measures of the same outcome in the same patient. Similarly, the day on which swabs were routinely taken varied between studies. Rates of colonisation tend to increase with length of hospital stay, so comparing data on this outcome was not feasible unless swabs had been collected on the same postnatal day. Other data were reported as a rate per 100 days making it impossible to combine these results with other outcome data to estimate an overall effect. Although techniques are now available for analysing cluster allocated studies, results were all analysed as if allocation was by individual, ignoring the cluster design and creating a potential to over-estimate the intervention effect. However, based on the consistency of findings between studies, the method of analysis is unlikely to have changed the primary results of this review.</P>
<P>There was little evidence in this review of either harm or benefit of overgown use when outcomes such as systemic infection, localised infection or colonisation were compared. The only important outcome that showed a strong trend in either direction was death before discharge, where the trend was towards a lower death rate among infants nursed in the non-gowning periods. The two studies contributing to the trend were conducted over 30 years ago when death rates in neonatal intensive care units were very high (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1967</LINK>). Both of the studies used a cluster design and analysed results as though allocation was by individual, which may have tended to overestimate treatment effect. In addition, overgowns were worn by attendants and visitors whenever incubator lids were open or if the infant was removed from the cot, making it unlikely that gowning could account for the observed differences. In the most recent and largest trial, no deaths were reported in either the gowning or no-gowning periods (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1995</LINK>). The one result that showed a significant difference when overgowns were worn or not worn by visitors and attendants was stool colonisation, with a reduction during gown periods. This result was flawed by the study methodology, where there was evidence of repeat measures on the same infant.</P>
<P>Other outcomes such as handwashing frequency, length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and traffic in and out of the nursery were not significantly affected by overgown use. Based on these results and considering the costs associated with gowning, hospital personnel may wish to review their policies.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity effected one comparison, systemic infection. This may be explained by some of the issues outlined above, or because there was some variation in outcome when the older studies were compared with more recent investigations.</P>
<P>All the NICU studies included in this review used cluster allocation rather than allocating individual patients to the experimental and control groups. Allocation by cluster might be seen as a strength of study design for this question. It mirrors the way the intervention is offered in practice and minimises contamination of the experimental and control groups. Secondary cases (of colonisation, infection, death) are included in the measure of effect. If a favoured policy is identified in such a study, the application of that result in practice would be to use the favoured policy in all babies, thus mimicking a cluster allocation design. However, future trials which use cluster allocation should use truly random methods for allocating by cluster and should analyse the data taking into account the clustering of allocation.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review does not provide evidence that overgowns are effective in limiting infant colonisation, infection or death in newborn nurseries. Nor does gowning appear to impact on handwashing frequency. The costs associated with gowning are considerable.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In light of changes in hospital practices (such as rooming in, shortened length of stay and widespread discontinuation of overgown use) since many of the included studies were conducted, further investigations of the effect of overgowns on infection or colonisation rates in well-baby newborn nurseries appear to be unwarranted as their results would not be applicable to current practice. </P>
<P>The question of gowning in neonatal intensive care settings has not been tested using a randomised controlled design. Future investigations in this area should focus on important outcomes such as death and systemic infection using high quality randomised controlled designs of sufficient size to yield a conclusive result. Future studies that use cluster allocation should use truly random rather than quasi-random methods for allocating by cluster, and should analyse the data using methods which take into account the cluster design.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>No gown: Nursing staff wore scrub suits, which were home -laundered and worn to the hospital from home. Other visitors and staff wore their street clothes when entering the NICU. Residents were the only group who continued to wear hospital-laundered scrubs and they wore an over-gown when leaving the area. Gowns were available for parents to use when holding their infants but these were not used. <BR/>Gown:<BR/>Nursery staff changed into scrub dresses or suits and covered these with a gown if they left the area. Other visitors or staff wore gowns over their street clothes when entering the NICU. <BR/>Infants had nasopharyngeal (or tracheal aspirate if intubated), umbilical and rectal or stool swab taken weekly. <BR/>Nursery traffic was monitored by tallying the number of people who entered the NICU during two 15-minute periods per day on two days per week. Handwashing compliance was studied by 30 minutes observation by one infants bedside three times weekly. Bedside areas were rotated each week.<BR/>
