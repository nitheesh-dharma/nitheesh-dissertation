Many solid cancers are low in oxygen (hypoxic), which means they are resistant to the effect of radiotherapy treatment. For this reason, it has been suggested that raising the oxygen levels in the tumours by administering HBO breathing could make treatment with radiotherapy more effective.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B><BR/>We found 19 randomised trials that together included 2286 participants. The dose of oxygen per treatment session in the HBO arm was remarkably uniform, with all trials except one administering external beam radiation therapy at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA). However, the number of treatments given ranged widely, from two sessions only, separated by three weeks, up to 40 sessions over eight weeks.The total dose of radiation was generally reduced in the HBO participants in order to reduce side effects. The follow-up period varied between trials, from six months to 10 years, although most studies followed participants for between two and five years.</P><P><B>Key results</B><BR/>Adding HBO to the treatment of head and neck cancers reduced mortality at both one year and five years after therapy. Local tumour recurrence was also less likely with HBO at one year and five years in head and neck cancer. However, these advantages are achieved at the cost of some adverse effects. There was a significant increase in the rate of severe radiation tissue injury and the chance of seizures during HBO therapy.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B><BR/>The quality of evidence was generally high with close agreement between several different trials. Similarly, there was high-quality evidence of an increased risk of having a severe reaction to the radiation while breathing HBO. The evidence for an increased risk of seizures during treatment when using HBO was of moderate quality, mainly because of the small numbers of seizures seen in the included studies.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B><BR/>There is some evidence that breathing oxygen while at raised pressure may improve mortality and reduce tumour regrowth in cancers of the head and neck, but at the cost of increased side effects.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-04-03 10:07:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-27 13:17:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Cancer is a common disease and radiotherapy is one well-established treatment for some solid tumours.

There was a lower incidence of local recurrence of tumour when using HBOT at both one and five years (RR at one year 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). There was also some evidence with regard to the chance of metastasis at five years (RR with HBOT 0.45 95% CI 0.09 to 2.30, single trial moderate quality evidence imprecision). No trials reported a quality of life assessment. Any benefits come at the cost of an increased risk of severe local radiation reactions with HBOT (severe radiation reaction RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.23, high-quality evidence). However, the available evidence failed to clearly demonstrate an increased risk of seizures from acute oxygen toxicity (RR 4.3, 95% CI 0.47 to 39.6, moderate-quality evidence).</P><P>For carcinoma of the uterine cervix, there was no clear benefit in terms of mortality at either one year or five years (RR with HBOT at one year 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). Similarly, there was no clear evidence of a benefit of HBOT in the reported rate of local recurrence (RR with HBOT at one year 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.13, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). We also found no clear evidence for any effect of HBOT on the rate of development of metastases at both two years and five years (two years RR with HBOT 1.05, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.31, high quality evidence; five years RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.26, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency). There were, however, increased adverse effects with HBOT. The risk of a severe radiation injury at the time of treatment with HBOT was 2.05, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.46, high-quality evidence. No trials reported any failure of local tumour control, quality of life assessments, or the risk of seizures during treatment.</P><P>With regard to the treatment of urinary bladder cancer, there was no clear evidence of a benefit in terms of mortality from HBOT at one year (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.27, high-quality evidence), nor any benefit in the risk of developing metastases at two years (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.91, moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision). No trial reported on failure of local control, local recurrence, quality of life, or adverse effects.</P><P>When all cancer types were combined, there was evidence for an increased risk of severe radiation tissue injury during the course of radiotherapy with HBOT (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.33, high-quality evidence) and of oxygen toxic seizures during treatment (RR with HBOT 6.76, 96% CI 1.16 to 39.31, moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision).</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>We found evidence that HBOT improves local tumour control, mortality, and local tumour recurrence for cancers of the head and neck. These benefits may only occur with unusual fractionation schemes. Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is associated with severe tissue radiation injury. Given the methodological and reporting inadequacies of the included studies, our results demand a cautious interpretation. More research is needed for head and neck cancer, but is probably not justified for uterine cervical or bladder cancer. There is little evidence available concerning malignancies at other anatomical sites.<BR/></P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-27 09:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joanne Platt"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Invasive cancer continues to be a major world health problem. Approximately 14 million people were diagnosed with cancer in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>), and it is estimated there will be 15 million new cases every year by 2020. Cancer caused 8.8 million deaths in 2015, or 17% of deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>), and is the second leading cause of death in the USA, being associated with a projected 0.6 million deaths in 2017 (<LINK REF="REF-Seigel-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seigel 2017</LINK>). Radiotherapy is a well-established treatment of suitable malignancies in a wide variety of anatomical areas. In the USA, approximately 1.7 million new cases are diagnosed annually, and about 50% of these will be treated with radiation (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2002</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is relatively widely available in North America (where there are more than 800 facilities registered with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society), Russia, China, and Cuba, but is less well established in Europe and Australasia (<LINK REF="REF-UHMS-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">UHMS 2017</LINK>). Treatment involves placing the patient in a compression chamber, increasing the environmental pressure within the chamber, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Treatments for tumour oxygen sensitisation typically involve pressurisation to between 2.0 and 4.0 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for periods of between 20 and 30 minutes for pre-oxygenation, following which the radiation therapy is delivered while the patient continues to breathe oxygen at pressure. A range of radiation fractionation and dosing schemes has been suggested.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Many, if not all, solid tumours include regions where there is significant hypoxia, and it has been established for some years that these areas of hypoxia are resistant to therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1996</LINK>). A body of evidence exists to suggest that this radioresistance can be overcome by a variety of measures including increasing oxygen pressure within the tumour (e.g. high oxygen content breathing, administration of red blood cells) and administration of radiation sensitising agents (e.g. nitroimidazoles such as nimorazole) (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grau-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grau 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1979</LINK>). The effectiveness of such measures remains controversial, and despite more than 10,000 participants in total being randomised to a variety of treatment and control groups, no clinically important benefits of these treatments have been conclusively demonstrated. One review with meta-analysis suggested a reduction in tumour recurrence at the site irradiated, and in the lymph nodes draining that site when all methods to modify tumour hypoxia were combined and compared to control, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1996</LINK>). The search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria for trials, definition of outcomes, and statistical methods of this review were not clear from that report.</P><P>One attractive method for increasing oxygen pressure in hypoxic areas is the administration of 100% oxygen at greater than one atmosphere total pressure, a procedure known as hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). Hyperbaric oxygenation was first used for this purpose in the 1960s and was reported by Churchill-Davidson (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1968</LINK>). The technique of administering radiation whilst confined in a hyperbaric chamber was adopted in a number of centres around the world, but inherent difficulties with the physical requirements and the advent of orally administered agents to improve tumour sensitivity to radiation led to the abandonment of this combined approach during the 1980s.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>The decisions described above were made despite the publication of a number of promising clinical trials with HBO, and it has been suggested that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (HBOT) was abandoned before a measured evaluation could be made of its true clinical impact (<LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1996</LINK>). While many of the trials using HBO were included in the <LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1996</LINK> review, we believe a structured systematic search may reveal further evidence, and we are aware of at least two randomised trials published after 1996 (<LINK REF="STD-Dische-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dische 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haffty-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haffty 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses, and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of myopia, claustrophobia, and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBO cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention. It has further been suggested that HBOT may increase the incidence and/or rate of growth of local recurrence or remote metastatic disease in people with a history of malignancy, although a comprehensive review failed to support these concerns (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2003</LINK>). For all of these reasons, we believed a review could clarify the true value, if any, of HBOT in this area.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>To assess the benefits and harms of administering radiotherapy for the treatment of malignant tumours while breathing HBO.</P><OL><LI>Does the addition of HBO to radiation therapy:</LI><OL><LI>reduce mortality at any time following therapy?</LI><LI>increase local tumour response?</LI><LI>reduce the incidence of local recurrence?</LI><LI>reduce the incidence of metastatic spread?</LI><LI>improve the quality of life for these people?</LI></OL><LI>Does sensitisation to radiation therapy with HBO produce any of the benefits above when compared to other agents?</LI><LI>Is HBO administration safe in this setting?</LI></OL></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-27 09:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joanne Platt"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2012-02-21 14:03:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that:<BR/></P><UL><LI>compared the effect of simultaneous HBOT and radiation therapy to regimens employing radiation therapy while breathing air, or</LI><LI>compared the effect of simultaneous HBOT and radiation therapy to regimens employing another sensitising therapy and radiation therapy.</LI></UL></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-01-31 13:22:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>People with solid tumours where radiation therapy is indicated.

In general, HBO exposure during irradiation was more beneficial when the total dose of radiation was delivered in low numbers of fractions (12 or fewer) than when a more conventional 20- to 25-fraction scheme was used. Any possible benefit of HBO must therefore be interpreted in the context of the most effective fractionation scheme in air.</P><P>For head and neck cancer, there was an overall reduction in the risk of dying at both one year and five years after therapy (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, NNTB = 11 and RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 37%, NNTB = 5, respectively; high-quality evidence), and some evidence of improved local tumour control immediately following irradiation (RR with HBOT 0.58, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30%, NNTB = 7; moderate-quality evidence only due to imprecision). There was also a lower incidence of recurrence of tumour when using HBOT at both one and five years (RR at one year 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, NNTB = 5, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 32%, NNTB = 6, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). No trials reported either the risk of developing metastases or quality of life assessment. Any benefits come at the cost of an increased risk of adverse effects with HBOT (severe radiation reaction RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.23, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 1%, high-quality evidence; seizures from acute oxygen toxicity RR 4.3, 95% CI 0.47 to 39.6, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision). There was some evidence from a single trial for a reduction in the chance of metastases at five years after treatment, but with considerable uncertainty (RR with HBOT 0.45 95% CI 0.09 to 2.30, moderate quality evidence). <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P><P>For carcinoma of the uterine cervix, there was no clear benefit in terms of mortality at either one year or five years (RR with HBOT at one year 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). Similarly, there was no clear evidence of a benefit of HBOT in the rate of recurrence reported (RR with HBOT at one year 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 23%, high-quality evidence; RR at five years 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.13, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%, moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency between trials). We also found no clear evidence for any effect of HBOT on the rate of development of metastases at two years (RR with HBOT 1.05, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.31, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high quality evidence) or at five years (RR with HBOT 0.79, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.26, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%, moderate quality evidence downgraded due to inconsistency). There were, however, increased adverse effects with HBOT. The risk of a severe radiation injury at the time of treatment with HBOT was 2.05, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.46, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 42%, high-quality evidence.

There were 785 participants with head and neck tumours, 1089 with carcinoma of the cervix, and 343 with carcinoma of the bladder. While there were sufficient numbers to form some impression of treatment impact for these tumours, there were only 49 participants with carcinoma of the bronchus and four each of glioblastoma, carcinoma of the rectum, and carcinoma of the oesophagus. The trials in this review therefore have low power to assess the impact of HBO on these tumours.</P><P>We included data from 19 trials investigating the treatment of various malignancies with radiation therapy while breathing HBO, and we believe these represent all randomised human trials in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of our search of the databases. We did not locate further trials when we repeated the searches in September 2008, March 2011, and September 2017. Ten trials included participants with head and neck cancers, seven trials of carcinoma of the uterine cervix, five trials of carcinoma of the urinary bladder, and one trial each of carcinoma of the bronchus, glioblastoma, cancer of the oesophagus, and cancer of the rectum. We found some evidence that radiotherapy with HBO reduces the one- and five-year mortality rate and local tumour recurrence, along with improved early local tumour control for head and neck cancer, and two-year local recurrence for carcinoma of the cervix. We also found evidence of significant adverse effects with HBOT, particularly the incidence of oxygen toxic seizures and the chance of suffering severe radiation injury. There were no reliable data from these trials to confirm any beneficial effect of HBOT for other malignancies studied, nor on the incidence of metastatic disease for cancers of any primary site.</P><P>These trials were published over a 32-year period up to 1999, mainly drawing participants from the UK and the USA. We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to age, dose of oxygen, dose of radiation therapy, and the temporal relationship of the two therapies. However, after appraisal of these trials, we were only able to conduct a subgroup analysis for the different fractionation schemes employed. Specifically, no children were included and no trials used a sequential approach to HBOT and radiation therapy, while the dose of oxygen administered was remarkably uniform per session.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Although study quality varied across the included trials, in general the methodology was reasonable, as 13 of the 19 included trials employed a reliable method of randomisation and allocation concealment. Although none of the trials employed a sham therapy, most of our clinical outcomes, such as mortality and cancer recurrence, were unlikely to be subject to participant or observer bias. The quality of the evidence was generally high or moderate for the primary outcomes (assessed using the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK> methodology). Some major problems of this review were the poor reporting of methodological quality in some of the included trials, variability in entry criteria, the nature and timing of outcomes, and poor reporting of outcomes. In particular, there is a possibility of bias due to different fractionation schemes and radiation doses across the trials, as well as a general failure to report data suitable for comparison of survival over time using the lgHR. None of the trials blinded participants, investigators, or outcome assessors to treatment.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>All of these findings are subject to potential publication bias. While we have made every effort to locate further unpublished data, it remains possible that this review is subject to a positive publication bias, with generally favourable trials more likely to achieve reporting. With regard to any effect on the quality of life for these participants, we have located little relevant data.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Our findings are in general agreement with previously published reviews of the area. In his review of modifying agents designed to sensitise tumours to the effect of radiotherapy, Overgaard has suggested that HBOT was abandoned before a measured evaluation was made of its true clinical impact (<LINK REF="REF-Overgaard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overgaard 1996</LINK>). This decision seems to have been based more on convenience and logistics rather than a demonstrated superiority of alternative sensitising agents.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>There is some evidence that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (HBOT) improves local tumour control and mortality for cancers of the head and neck, as well as reducing the chance of local tumour recurrence in cancers of the head, neck, and uterine cervix. However, there is also some evidence that these outcomes may be related to the use of unusual fractionation schemes, and these benefits should be interpreted with caution. Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy also appears to be associated with significant adverse effects including oxygen toxic seizures and severe tissue radiation injury. Given the methodological and reporting inadequacies of the primary studies included in this review, our results demand a cautious interpretation.More research is needed for head and neck cancer, but is probably not justified for uterine cervical or bladder cancer. There is little evidence available concerning malignancies at other anatomical sites.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>Given the findings of improved tumour control and mortality with the use of HBO for people with cancers of the head, neck, and uterine cervix, there is a case for large randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit (if any) from the administration of HBO for these cancers at appropriate fractionations schemes. Specifically, such trials must employ appropriate fractionation schemes in both arms to clearly define any benefits of HBOT as opposed to novel fractionation. The effect of differing oxygen dosage and effect of other therapies administered simultaneously is not known. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:</P><UL><LI>appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences;</LI><LI>careful definition and selection of target patients;</LI><LI>appropriate range of oxygen doses per treatment session (pressure and time);</LI><LI>use of an effective sham therapy where appropriate and ethical;</LI><LI>effective and explicit blinding of outcome assessors;</LI><LI>appropriate outcome measures including all those listed in this review;</LI><LI>careful elucidation of any adverse effects; and</LI><LI>the cost-utility of the therapy.</LI></UL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-04-03 10:51:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><P>We thank Gail Quinn and Clare Jess (Managing Editors) of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancer Group for their assistance in the preparation of this review.
