<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Laparoscopic techniques versus open techniques for repair of a hernia in the groin</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Repair of a hernia in the groin (an inguinal hernia) is the most frequently performed operation in general surgery. The hernia is repaired (with suturing or placing a synthetic mesh over the hernia in one of the layers of the abdominal wall) using either open surgery or minimal access laparoscopy. The most common laparoscopic techniques for inguinal hernia repair are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair. In TAPP the surgeon goes into the peritoneal cavity and places a mesh through a peritoneal incision over possible hernia sites. TEP is different as the peritoneal cavity is not entered and mesh is used to seal the hernia from outside the thin membrane covering the organs in the abdomen (the peritoneum). The mesh, where used, becomes incorporated by fibrous tissue. Minor postoperative problems occur. More serious complications such as damage to the spermatic cord, a blood vessel or nerves, are occasionally reported with open surgery and nerve or major vascular injuries, bowel obstruction, and bladder injury have been reported with laparoscopic repair. Reoccurrence of a hernia is a major drawback.<BR/>The review authors identified 41 eligible controlled trials in which a total of 7161 participants were randomized to laparoscopic or open surgery repair. The mean or median duration of follow up of patients ranged from 6 to 36 months.<BR/>Return to usual activities was faster for laparoscopic repair, by about seven days, and there was less persisting pain and numbness than with open surgery. However, operation times were some 15 minutes longer (range 14 to 16 minutes) with laparoscopy and there appeared to be a higher number of serious complications of visceral (especially bladder) and vascular injuries. Using a mesh for repair reduced the risk of a recurring hernia rather than the method of placement (open or laparoscopic surgery). </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequently performed operation in general surgery. The standard method for inguinal hernia repair had changed little over a hundred years until the introduction of synthetic mesh. This mesh can be placed by either using an open approach or by using a minimal access laparoscopic technique. Although many studies have explored the relative merits and potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for the repair of inguinal hernia, most individual trials have been too small to show clear benefits of one type of surgical repair over another.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare minimal access laparoscopic mesh techniques with open techniques. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Registry for relevant randomised controlled trials. The reference list of identified trials, journal supplements, relevant book chapters and conference proceedings were searched for further relevant trials. Through the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration (EUHTC) communication took place with authors of identified randomised controlled trials to ask for information on any other recent and ongoing trials known to them. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic groin hernia repair with open groin hernia repair were eligible for inclusion. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Individual patient data were obtained, where possible, from the responsible trialist for all eligible studies. Where IPD were unavailable additional aggregate data were sought from trialists and published aggregate data checked and verified by the trialists. Where possible, time to event analysis for hernia recurrence and return to usual activities were performed on an intention to treat principle. The main analyses were based on all trials. Sensitivity analyses based on the data source and trial quality were also performed. Pre-defined subgroup analyses based on recurrent hernias, bilateral hernias and femoral hernias were also carried out. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Forty-one eligible trials of laparoscopic versus open groin hernia repair were identified involving 7161 participants (with individual patient data available for 4165). Meta-analysis was performed, using individual patient data where possible. Operation times for laparoscopic repair were longer and there was a higher risk of rare serious complications. Return to usual activities was faster, and there was less persisting pain and numbness. Hernia recurrence was less common than after open non-mesh repair but not different to open mesh methods.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The review showed that laparoscopic repair takes longer and has a more serious complication rate in respect of visceral (especially bladder) and vascular injuries, but recovery is quicker with less persisting pain and numbness. Reduced hernia recurrence of around 30-50% was related to the use of mesh rather than the method of mesh placement. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequently performed operation in general surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rutkow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutkow 1993</LINK>). Approximately 80,000 are performed each year in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Kingsnorth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingsnorth 1992</LINK>), 100,000 in France (<LINK REF="REF-Levard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levard 1996</LINK>) and 700,000 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Schumpelick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumpelick 1994</LINK>). Because inguinal hernia repair is performed so frequently, relatively modest improvements in clinical outcomes would have a significant medical impact (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard method for inguinal hernia repair had changed little over the hundred years since Bassini introduced the modern era of herniorrhaphy (<LINK REF="REF-Bassini-1887" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassini 1887</LINK>). Bassini's method relies on a musculo-aponeurotic repair to close the abdominal wall defect under tension, eliminate the presence of a lump and relieve the patient's discomfort. Minor postoperative problems are not uncommon, while more serious complications, such as damage to the spermatic cord, the femoral vein or artery, or the genitofemoral or ilioinguinal nerves are occasionally reported. However, its major drawback is recurrence. Annual statistics from various countries show that, despite many modifications introduced by Shouldice, McVay and others, 10-15% of inguinal hernia operations are for recurrent hernias (<LINK REF="REF-Liem-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liem 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A newer concept of groin hernia repair is to cover the hernia defect with a prosthetic mesh. This mesh is placed on one of the layers of the abdominal wall either using an open approach or a minimal access laparoscopic technique. The two most common types of laparoscopic repair are the transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and the totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP). Some surgeons fix the mesh with staples or sutures whereas others now do not. Schrenk et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schrenk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrenk 1996</LINK>) claimed that the benefits of laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy included a decrease in postoperative pain, reduced hospital stay and early return to normal activity. However, serious complications have also been reported, such as nerve injuries, major vascular injuries, bowel obstruction, and bladder injury (<LINK REF="REF-Kald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kald 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although many studies have explored the relative merits and potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for the repair of inguinal hernia, most individual trials have been too small to show clear benefits of one type of surgical repair over another and their authors' conclusions have not been consistent. Nevertheless, many of these trials have had important influence on clinical practice and consequently the debate surrounding the optimal treatment for the surgical repair of inguinal hernia has continued.</P>
<P>In 1996 the International Study Group for Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair (ISLIR) suggested a 'standard' approach to data collection as a basis for an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to combine the results from all available randomised evidence evaluating laparoscopic repair for inguinal hernia. The EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration (EUHTC) was established in 1998, under whose auspices the meta-analysis was conducted. The project secretariat, funded by the EU BIOMED II workprogramme, made contact with the principal investigators of all known relevant randomised controlled trials and invited them to collaborate. The EUHTC first conducted a meta-analysis of published data only and the results of this were published in Issue 4 2000 of the Cochrane Library and the British Journal of Surgery (<LINK REF="REF-EUHTC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUHTC 2000</LINK>). However, as expected, these analyses showed that there were insufficient published data to provide reliable estimates of some treatment effects. The purpose of this new version of the review is to build on the published meta-analyses by using, where possible, the results of individual patient data analyses to provide a more comprehensive overview of available trial evidence regarding the benefits and harms of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. These analyses were completed in January 2001.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The purpose of this review was to compare minimal access laparoscopic mesh techniques with open techniques for inguinal hernia repair. Comparisons of open mesh techniques versus open non-mesh techniques have been considered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2001</LINK>).</P>
</OBJECTIVES>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The trials included all patients with a clinical diagnosis of inguinal hernia for whom surgical management was judged appropriate.

<P>4. Specialists involved in research on the repair of inguinal hernia were contacted to ask for information about any further completed and ongoing trials.</P>
<P>5. Potentially useful sites on the world wide web were checked for references to relevant trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>This review is based on individual patient data obtained directly from the principal investigator or responsible trialist. The methods used were prespecified in a protocol.</P>
<P>Data were sought for all patients randomised in all eligible published and unpublished randomised controlled trials and follow-up beyond that previously published was requested. When received the IPD were thoroughly checked for internal consistency and consistency with any published reports. Any apparent discrepancies and queries were resolved by discussion with the responsible trialists who also verified the final version of the analyses for each trial. All analyses were based on the original allocation regardless of the actual method of repair performed ('intention to treat'). If patients had been excluded because they did not receive the allocated procedure, details were sought and included where possible.</P>
<P>Where IPD were not available, aggregated data were used; the trialist was asked to verify information abstracted from their publication and supplement this where possible. Any apparent discrepancies and queries were resolved by discussion with the responsible trialists who also verified the final results used for each trial.</P>
<P>Where IPD or additional aggregate data where not available, published data taken from the trial reports were used. All studies were assessed for methodological quality. This was performed by two reviewers independently. Where a difference of opinion existed, the two reviewers consulted an arbiter. The system for classifying methodological quality of trials was based on an assessment of the three principal potential sources of bias. These are: selection bias from insecure random allocation of treatments; attrition bias; and biased ascertainment of outcome where knowledge of the allocation might have influenced the measurement of outcome. The same two reviewers abstracted the outcome data, and other important details of the trial such as the length of follow-up, type of hernia, method of hernia diagnosis, inclusion and exclusion criteria. These data were double checked and any differences of opinion resolved by an arbiter.</P>
<P>For each outcome the results were derived from the best available source: if IPD were not available, information from aggregate data provided by the trialist or data from the trial publications were used. Dichotomous outcome data were combined using the Peto odds ratio method and continuous outcomes were combined using the Mantel-Haenszel weighted mean difference method. Time to return to usual activities was described using IPD by calculating hazard ratios. The interpretation of this outcome is similar to that of other outcomes except that the graph shows estimated hazard ratios instead of odds ratios. By using the IPD the hazard ratio compares the rate of return to usual activities in each group while taking account of the fact that not all trial participants will have returned to usual activities during the follow-up period. The observed minus the expected number of events with its variance were derived for each trial using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The results are all reported using a fixed effects model. Chi-squared tests were used to test for heterogeneity across studies and where significant heterogeneity was found possible reasons were explored. </P>
<P>The review was conducted using the standard Cochrane software 'RevMan 4.1'. Comparison 1 considers laparoscopic versus open repair. Within this analysis, the trials were ordered by the method of laparoscopic repair (TAPP and TEP). Comparison 2 considers laparoscopic TAPP versus open repair and the trials were ordered by the method of open repair (open mesh or non-mesh). Comparison 3 considers laparoscopic TEP versus open repair and the trials were also ordered by the method of open repair (open mesh or non-mesh). Comparisons 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 repeat this but include patients with recurrent, bilateral and femoral hernias respectively. </P>
<P>Duration of operation was defined as time from first incision to last suture or time in theatre where this was not available. "Opposite" method was defined as a laparoscopic repair initiated when an open repair was allocated, or an open repair initiated when a laparoscopic repair was allocated. A conversion was defined as a proceedure initiated as a laparoscopic but converted to an open repair, or a procedure initiated as an open but converted to a laparoscopic. Haematoma included wound or scrotal haematoma or ecchymosis but not bruising. Seroma included hydrocele. Wound/superficial infection was defined as wound related infections only and included pus from wound, fistula and sinus formation. Length of postoperative stay was defined as time from admission to discharge. Time to return to usual activities was defined as normal social activities or work where this was not available. Persisting pain was defined as groin pain of any severity (including testicular) persisting at one year after the operation, or at the closest timepoint to one year provided this was at least three months after surgery. Persisting numbness included paresthesia, dysesthesia and discomfort persisting at one year after the operation, or at the closest timepoint to one year provided this was at least three months after surgery. Hernia recurrence data were based on the methods of ascertainment used in individual trials. </P>
<P>The main analyses were based on all trials. However, we also planned a priori sensitivity analyses based on: 1) IPD data alone; 2) Trials with adequate allocation concealment. A priori sub-group analyses for recurrent hernia, bilateral hernias and femoral hernias were also planned, as described above.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The characteristics of the 41 trials are summarised in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. There were 45 relevant comparisons in 41 eligible trials (7161 participants), because four trials had three-arms. Of the 41 trials included, 34 were reported in full papers and seven as abstracts only. IPD were provided for 25 trials (4165 participants) four of which have a published abstract only, and additional aggregated data for a further seven (2002 participants). Published data only were available for the other nine (994 participants). Two of these were identified too late to approach the authors for individual patient data, with information available for each limited to a conference abstract. All trials were restricted to elective inguinal hernia repair. 19 included recurrent as well as primary hernias, 14 were limited to primary hernias only, one included recurrent hernias only, and these details were not reported for seven. Based on IPD, participants had a mean age of 54.2 (14.9), 96% were men, 11% had recurrent hernias, 9% bilateral, and 1% femoral. The comparisons in the 41 trials were: TAPP versus open mesh (11 trials, 1206 participants); TAPP versus open non-mesh (12 trials, 1528 participants); TAPP versus mixed open (1 trial, 57 participants); TEP versus open mesh (6 trials, 690 participants); TEP versus non-mesh (5 trials, 1522 participants); TAPP versus TEP versus open non-mesh (one trial, 86 participants); mixture of laparoscopic versus a mixture of open repairs (2 trials, 1051 participants); and TAPP versus open mesh versus open non-mesh (three trials, 1021 participants). Across the trials where reported, all but seven of the patients allocated to laparoscopic repairs received a general anaesthetic (one had a local and six regional). Patients in the open groups received general, regional or local anaesthesia, determined by the trial protocol or surgeon's choice. </P>

<P>The method of randomisation used was stated explicitly for 36 of 41 trials: central randomisation service in four, sealed envelopes in 23, computer generated random numbers in two and random number tables in three (although concealment details were not described), by alternation in two, by birthdate in one, and random selection by cards in one. In 5 trials, the allocation was said to be 'randomised' but the method was not specified. The trials ranged in size from 38 to 994 randomised patients. The mean or median duration of follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 36 months, 25 trials confirmed hernia diagnosis by clinical examination and in 21 trials the operation was reported to have been performed by an 'experienced' surgeon or one who had performed at least 10 laparoscopic hernia repairs. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1) Duration of operation</P>
<P>The average length of operation was longer in the laparoscopic groups in 36 of 37 trials with data (Comparison 01.01). Overall the WMD was 14.81 minutes (95% CI 13.98 to 15.64; p&lt;0.0001). The estimated effect size was broadly consistent for the comparisons of TAPP versus open and TEP versus open in all sub-categories (open mesh, open non mesh and mixed open: Comparisons 02.01 and 03.01). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity but, consistency in direction of effect, even when size and effect estimates varied.<BR/> <BR/>2) "Opposite" method initiated</P>
<P>The 'opposite' method was initiated in 59/2053 (2.9%) allocated laparoscopic repairs and 12/2108 (0.6%) allocated open repairs (Comparison 01.02). Similar patterns were observed after allocation to TAPP ( Comparison 02.02) and TEP (Comparison 03.02). </P>
<P>3) Conversions</P>
<P>In total, 85 (2.7%) laparoscopic operations were stated to have been converted to an open procedure amongst 3130 allocated laparoscopic repairs and 5 (0.1%) open procedures were converted to a laparoscopic repair amongst 3541 allocated open repairs (Comparison 01.03: Peto OR 6.73, 95% CI 4.42 to 10.24; p&lt;0.0001). Higher rates observed in TEP trials reflected two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coala-Trial-Gp-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Coala Trial Gp 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>) (Comparisons 02.03 and 03.03).</P>
<P>4) Haematoma</P>
<P>Overall, there appeared to be fewer haematomas in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 01.04: 238/2747 vs 317/3007: Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; p&lt;0.01) but this reflected TEP trials. Stratification by whether TAPP or TEP largely explained the statistical heterogeneity. There were no clear differences when TAPP trials were considered (Comparison (02.04). Eight of the nine TEP trials favoured laparoscopic repair in this respect (Comparison 03.04). </P>
<P>5) Seroma</P>
<P>Overall, there were more seromas in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 0105: 139/2408 vs 101/2679: Peto OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.08; P=0.001). The heterogeneity between studies is largely explained by the <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK> trial. Excluding this trial, suggests a doubling of the risk of seroma following laparoscopic repair irrespective of method; including it, suggests the differential effect is limited to TAPP repair only (Comparison 02.05 and 03.05). </P>
<P>6) Wound/Superficial infection</P>
<P>Where reported, wound/superficial infection also appeared less frequent in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 01.06: Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.65; p&lt;0.0001). Although these results were particularly influenced by the <LINK REF="STD-Whipps-Cross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Whipps Cross 1998</LINK> trial, the difference remained significant when this trial was removed. The estimated effect was similar when comparing TAPP with open and TEP with open, although non-significant in the TEP versus open comparison. </P>
<P>7) Mesh/deep infection</P>
<P>There were only three reported cases of mesh/deep infection: one case of mesh infection in a laparoscopic TAPP group (<LINK REF="STD-Nyborg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nyborg 1999</LINK>); one case of mesh infection in an open mesh group (<LINK REF="STD-Bydgoszcz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bydgoszcz 1998</LINK>); and one case of deep infection in an open non-mesh group (<LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1999</LINK>) (Comparisons 01.07; 02.07; and03.07).</P>
<P>8) Vascular injuries</P>
<P>There were three reported cases of intra-operative vascular injuries all occurring in laparoscopic groups: one unspecified vascular injury (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 1994</LINK>); one trocar injury to the left common iliac artery (<LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>); and one artery hit by a port causing a conversion (<LINK REF="STD-Woodville-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Woodville 1996</LINK>). There were eight post-operative vascular injuries, four in the laparoscopic groups consisting of two cases of post-operative bleeding which required re-operation (<LINK REF="STD-Maastricht-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maastricht 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stuttgart-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuttgart 1995</LINK>) and two haematomas which required re-operation (<LINK REF="STD-Maastricht-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maastricht 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stuttgart-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuttgart 1995</LINK>). The remaining four vascular injuries occurred in the open groups consisting of three haematomas requiring re-operation (<LINK REF="STD-Paris-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Paris 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stuttgart-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stuttgart 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Woodville-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Woodville 1996</LINK>) and one wound haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Whipps-Cross-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Whipps Cross 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>9) Visceral injuries</P>
<P>There were seven intra-operative visceral injuries, six were in the laparoscopic groups consisting of 4 bladder injuries (<LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tampere-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tampere 1998</LINK>), one re-operation causing small bowel damage (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 1994</LINK>), and one punctured stomach (<LINK REF="STD-Maastricht-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maastricht 1998</LINK>). One small bowel injury occurred in the open group of the <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK> trial. There were also two post-operative bowel obstructions both of which occurred in the laparoscopic groups (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>10) Port-site hernia</P>
<P>There were only 6 cases of port site hernia reported (<LINK REF="STD-Aarberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Aarberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Link_x00f6_ping-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Linköping 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whipps-Cross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Whipps Cross 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>11) Length of stay (days)</P>
<P>There was marked heterogeneity in length of hospital stay, with greater differences in mean stay between different hospitals than there were between laparoscopic and open repairs in the same hospital (Comparisons 01.11; 02.11; and 03.11). In respect of between trial group differences, the trials tended to show either no difference or a clear difference, sometimes in exact days (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Coala-Trial-Gp-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Coala Trial Gp 1997</LINK>). This suggests that the overall finding of shorter stay after laparoscopic repair reflects hospital policy rather than a true effect of the repair. </P>
<P>12) Time to return to usual activity (days)</P>
<P>In all trials with data, the time to return to usual activity was shorter in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 01.12: HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.61; p&lt;0.0001). This is equivalent to an absolute difference of about 7 days. The estimated effect was similar when comparing TAPP with open and TEP with open. However, there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity and this is likely to be due to differences between trials in: post-operative advice; definition of usual activity (e.g work, walking, sport); existing co-morbidity; and local 'cultures'.</P>
<P>13) Persisting pain</P>
<P>There were fewer cases of persisting pain at one year after the operation in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 01.13: overall 290/2101 versus 459/2399; Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.64; p&lt; 0.0001). The estimated effect was similar when comparing TAPP with open repair and TEP with open repair in all open mesh and open non-mesh sub-categories. The statistical heterogeneity was largely explained by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK>). This relatively large trial suggests a small difference, but still favoured laparoscopic repair. </P>
<P>14) Persisting numbness</P>
<P>There were fewer cases of persisting numbness in the laparoscopic groups (Comparison 01.14 overall 102/1419 versus 217/1624; Peto OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.49; p&lt;0.0001). The direction of effect was consistent when comparing TAPP with open repairs and TEP with open repairs. The data suggested a larger difference in TAPP (Comparison 02.14) than TEP trials (Comparison 03.14) but this again reflected the <LINK REF="STD-MRCmulticentre-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MRCmulticentre 1999</LINK> trial which contributed the majority of the TEP data. Overall, there was significant heterogeneity but not when TAPP and TEP were considered separately.</P>
<P>15) Hernia recurrence</P>
<P>Totals of 86 recurrences were reported amongst 3138 allocated laparoscopic repair and 109 amongst 3504 allocated to open repair (Comparison 01.15: Peto OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.08; p = 0.16). The comparative performance of both TAPP and TEP was, however, influenced by the nature of the open repair (Comparison 02.15 and 03.15). When the open repair was mesh, the rates of recurrence were similar in the trial groups. In contrast, when the open repair was non-mesh, recurrence was less common after laparoscopic repair, although this was statistically significant only for the TAPP comparison.</P>
<P>16) Known death</P>
<P>Only one death occurred within 30 days of surgery and this was unrelated to operation (<LINK REF="STD-Whipps-Cross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Whipps Cross 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>SUBGROUP ANALYSIS</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with recurrent hernias (Comparison 04,05 and 06), bilateral hernias (Comparison 07,08 and 09), and femoral hernias (Comparison 10, 11 and 12). Data were available from 12 trials for recurrent hernias, 12 trials for bilateral hernias, and 4 trials for femoral hernias. When considering recurrent and bilateral hernias all subgroup analyses were also consistent with or statistically compatible (i.e their confidence intervals did not rule out the effect estimate derived from the overall results) with the overall results. There were too few data to reliably perform subgroup analyses for patients with femoral hernias. </P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</P>
<P>Analyses restricted to IPD data alone gave similar estimates for recurrence to the overall results (Peto OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.14; p=0.2). Trials with adequate allocation concealment also gave similar estimates (Peto OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13; p=0.2).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review was conducted through the formal structure of the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration which ensured as complete identification of relevant trials as possible. IPD were provided for 25 trials, four of which have a published abstract only, and additional aggregated data for a further seven. This greatly enhanced the amount of data we were able to include in the review compared with the original version based on published data. This particularly applied to 'persisting pain'. The availability of IPD also helped to ensure a better quality of data and randomisation integrity. However, despite maximum effort, published data only were available for nine trials. Two of these trials were identified too late to approach the authors for individual patient data, with information available for each limited to a conference abstract. The framework of this collaboration means that it is unlikely that we have missed important trials, although we do know that one large trial with long term follow-up is currently unreported and recruitment to another is ongoing. </P>
<P>Our results provide evidence that after a laparoscopic repair return to usual activity is faster and persisting pain is reduced. However, operation times are longer and there appears to be a higher rate of serious complication rate in respect of visceral (especially bladder) and vascular injuries. Our findings relating to hernia recurrence are consistent with those in the review of open mesh versus open non-mesh repair of groin hernia (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2001</LINK>). That review provides evidence that the use of mesh in open repair is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of hernia recurrence. In this review both of the sub-group comparisons of laparoscopic groups (which use mesh) with non-mesh open methods favour the laparoscopic method (although not statistically significantly so for the TEP versus non-mesh comparison). This is equivalent to around a 30-50% reduction in the risk of hernia recurrence. However, when comparing laparoscopic methods with open mesh methods of hernia repair there is no apparent difference. Therefore results of the two reviews taken together provide evidence that the use of mesh is associated with a reduction in the risk of hernia recurrence rather than the method of placement and that the two methods of mesh placement appear equally effective in this respect. </P>
<P>The results for many of the outcomes in this review displayed significant heterogeneity. With the exception of recurrence there was generally consistency in direction of effect, even when size and effect estimates varied. Much of the variation was explained by differences in the methods of repair, both laparoscopic (TAPP or TEP) and open (mesh or non-mesh). Sensitivity analyses suggested that the type of data (IPD or not) and adequacy of allocation concealment did not influence the estimates of effect, at least in respect of recurrence. Other likely sources of heterogeneity, however, are differences in the way the outcomes were defined or measured; in operator experience; in the types of people studied; and in length of follow-up. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of mesh during laparoscopic hernia repair is associated with a reduction in the risk of hernia recurrence in comparison with non-mesh methods of hernia repair. However, there is no apparent difference when laparoscopic methods are compared with open mesh methods of hernia repair. The data available show less persisting pain and numbness following a laparoscopic repair and return to usual activities is faster. However, operation times are longer and there appears to be a higher serious complication rate in respect of visceral (especially bladder) and vascular injuries. An economic evaluation (not reported here) suggests that laparoscopic repair is more costly that an open mesh repair, and that this is not sufficiently offset by benefits to make it cost-effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To our knowledge, this is the first time that general surgeons have collaborated in this way and contributed their raw trial data for the purposes of a systematic review. We have demonstrated that, although costly, the collection of IPD can greatly enhance the data available for a Cochrane systematic review compared with using published data only. We used a liberal definition of 'persisting pain' with the consequence of widely varying prevalence rates across trials. Ideally, the issue of chronic pain should now be addressed prospectively using standard definitions and allowing assessment of the degree of pain.</P>
<P>Rare, serious complications are an important consideration in the context of minor surgery. Even considering trials involving over 7000 participants gives imprecise estimates; prospective population-based registries of new surgical proceedures may be the best way to address this. (The advantage of randomised trials, however, is formal entry prior to surgery and this ideal is unlikely to be accomplished in observational studies).</P>
<P>Questions remain about the relative merits and risks of TAPP and TEP. Further research is also required about the optimal mesh type (e.g. size) and placement (e.g. sutured, unsutured or stapled) proceedure for both laparoscopic and open mesh repair.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic groin hernia repair like most other surgical proceedures is technically challenging and performance is likely to improve with experience. In this review, the consistency of the trials (involving surgeons at varying stages of learning) provided reassurance that learning is not a major confounder. Nevertheless, the general issue is important and further methodological research is warranted in the context of both trials and meta-analyses of trials.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>There is a false data entry in the above-mentioned review. The recurrence rates in the comparison "TAPP versus Non-Mesh (Comparison 02-15)" contain data from a trial called "Nyborg 1999". The trial arm on mesh repair is said to contain 438 patients, but the trial in truth only had 138 patients in this treatment arm. This typing error has potential effects on the results, because the trial is now receiving a exaggeratedly high weight in the statistical analysis.</P>
