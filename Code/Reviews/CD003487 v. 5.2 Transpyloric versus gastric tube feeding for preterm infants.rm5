<P>Preterm infants often have poor co-ordination of sucking and swallowing and this can delay the establishment of safe oral feeding. Enteral feeds may be delivered through a catheter passed via the nose or the mouth into either the stomach (gastric feeding) or beyond the stomach into the next part of the bowel (transpyloric feeding). This review of trials found that babies receiving transpyloric feeding had more adverse events without any evidence of benefit over gastric feeding.</P>

<P>We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-18 15:59:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found nine eligible trials in which a total of 359 preterm infants participated. All of the trials contained methodological weaknesses with lack of allocation concealment, absence of blinding of caregivers or assessors, and incomplete follow-up being the major potential sources of bias. The included trials did not detect any statistically significant effects on feeding tolerance or in-hospital growth rates. Meta-analyses found that infants allocated to receive transpyloric feeding had a higher risk of gastro-intestinal disturbance (typical RR 1.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.09); typical RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.17); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 10 (95% CI 6 to 50); six studies, 245 infants) and all-case mortality (typical RR 2.46 (95% CI 1.36 to 4.46); typical RD 0.16 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.26); NNTH 6 (95% CI 4 to 14); six studies, 217 infants). However, the trial that contributed most weight to these findings was likely to have been affected by selective allocation of the less mature and sicker infants to transpyloric feeding. We did not find any statistically significant differences in the incidence of other adverse events, including necrotising enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, and aspiration pneumonia.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-19 10:42:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data do not provide evidence of any beneficial effect of transpyloric feeding for preterm infants. Some evidence of harm exists, including a higher risk of gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality, but these findings should be interpreted and applied cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-01 19:09:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-01 19:09:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants have poor co-ordination of sucking and swallowing and this can delay the establishment of safe oral feeding. Enteral feeds may be delivered through a catheter passed via the nose or the mouth into the stomach or upper small intestine. The gastro-oesophageal valve is more lax and gastric peristalsis and emptying is less effective in preterm than in term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Berseth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berseth 1989</LINK>). A further concern with intragastric feeding for preterm infants is that lower oesophageal sphincter laxity results in gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and, putatively, GOR-attributed apnoea or bradycardia and aspiration pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Misra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malcolm-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcolm 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-19 10:45:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Placement of the enteral feeding tube in the duodenum or jejunum (transpyloric feeding) rather than the stomach (gastric feeding) ensures delivery of enteral feeds to the main sites of nutrient absorption and has the theoretical advantage of decreasing the potential for oesophageal reflux, reflux-associated apnoea or bradycardia, and aspiration pneumonia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-23 15:36:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feeding by the transpyloric route also has potential problems. The gastric phase of the digestion is by-passed and secretion of upper intestinal hormones and growth factors may be impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Milner-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milner 1981</LINK>). There is also a risk that potentially pathogenic organisms, which would have been removed in the acidic environment of the stomach, may be delivered directly into upper small bowel (<LINK REF="REF-Dellagrammaticas-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellagrammaticas 1983</LINK>). These factors might contribute to a higher risk of necrotising enterocolitis in infants fed via the transpyloric route as suggested by observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Vazquez-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinocur-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinocur 1990</LINK>). Additionally, transpyloric feeding tubes are difficult to position and, unlike gastric tubes, the position of the transpyloric catheter must be confirmed with imaging. Following placement, the transpyloric tube may still migrate back to the stomach. Serious adverse events including cases of intestinal perforation and of pyloric stenosis have also been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Boros-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Boros 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raine-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1982</LINK>).</P>

<P>All of the included studies were undertaken in the 1970s or early 1980s. Most recruited very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt; 1500 g). However, only infants grown appropriately for gestational age were eligible for inclusion in most of the trials. In some trials infants who required respiratory or ventilatory support were not eligible for inclusion. Feeding by the allocated route was usually started within the first few days after birth when enteral feeds were commenced. Feeding tubes used were made of silastic, polyvinyl, or polypropylene. The transpyloric tubes were placed in the second or third part of duodenum or the jejunum with the assistance of positioning of the infant and peristalsis. In all of the trials the position of the tube was confirmed radiologically. All trials reported nutrient (usually energy) intake and short-term growth as the primary outcomes. In most reports, data on adverse events (including death, necrotising enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, and aspiration pneumonia) were available.</P>

At three and six months after the expected date of delivery, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in body weight or occipito-frontal head circumference.

Adverse events were often reported as withdrawal criteria rather than as pre-defined outcome measures.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-19 11:02:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any evidence of benefit of transpyloric compared with gastric feeding in preterm infants. We found some evidence that transpyloric feeding increases the risk of gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality. However, many of the studies included in the review had a variety of methodological weaknesses and these findings need to be interpreted and applied with caution (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:38:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two of the included trials assessed the effect of transpyloric versus gastric tube feeding on measures of 'feed tolerance' such as the time taken to establish enteral feeding. With regard to growth parameters, in many of the trials the growth data from infants who developed complications during the study period, or in whom enteral tube placement was unsuccessful, were not reported. In the largest included trial only 41 of the 80 infants who entered the study were included in the growth data analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Laing-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Laing 1986</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Drew-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Drew 1979</LINK>, of the 66 infants allocated to a feeding route, there were outcome data for only 44 infants. Given these levels of loss to follow-up, the findings should be regarded with caution. For example, it may be that the repeated failed attempts to position the transpyloric tube introduces a delay in starting or establishing nutritional input. Since it is plausible that such delay may affect growth, the findings may have been different in a true intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), aspiration, and apnoea/bradycardia</HEADING>
<P>Observational studies have suggested that transpyloric feeding may reduce the frequency or degree of GOR and GOR-related apnoea/bradycardia and prevent pulmonary aspiration of intestinal contents (<LINK REF="REF-Misra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malcolm-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcolm 2009</LINK>). This review did not find any evidence that transpyloric feeding affected the risk of aspiration pneumonia but a modest yet important effect size has not been excluded. However, none of the included trials assessed the effect of transpyloric versus gastric tube feeding on the incidence of GOR-related apnoea/bradycardia, and none of the trials specifically recruited infants with confirmed or suspected GOR or GOR-attributed problems. Although uncertainty exists as to whether GOR is an important cause of apnoea/bradycardia in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Peter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Di-Fiore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Fiore 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corvaglia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvaglia 2009</LINK>), it has been proposed that clinical trials are warranted to evaluate whether transpyloric feeding is an effective prevention or treatment option in preterm infants with clinical problems attributed to GOR (<LINK REF="REF-Misra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malcolm-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcolm 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-01 19:23:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The finding that transpyloric feeding increased the risk of mortality should also be interpreted carefully since it is possible that the pooled estimate in the meta-analysis is over-inflated by allocation bias in several of the trials. In particular, the outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Laing-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Laing 1986</LINK> (which contributes &gt; 50% of the weight to the pooled risk ratio) may have been affected by preferential allocation of less mature or sicker infants to the transpyloric feeding group. When this study was excluded from the meta-analysis the increase in mortality in the transpyloric group was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Similarly, the increase in the risk of gastrointestinal disturbance in infants who received transpyloric feeding may have been inflated by allocation bias as well as by ascertainment or surveillance biases since caregivers and clinicians were aware of the allocated intervention in all of the trials. We did not detect any statistically significant differences in the incidences of necrotising enterocolitis or intestinal perforation between the feeding groups. Additionally, although it may be pragmatic to compare continuous transpyloric feeding with intermittent or bolus gastric feeding, as was the case in seven of the included trials, this co-intervention may also have affected the outcomes. The Cochrane review that compared continuous nasogastric tube feeding versus intermittent bolus feeding for preterm infants concluded that the clinical benefits and harms could not be reliably discerned from the available data from randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The available trial data do not provide evidence that transpyloric feeding has benefits for preterm infants but do raise concerns about a higher risk of adverse affects including gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:38:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even if the concerns regarding an effect on mortality are discounted, the lack of evidence of an effect on growth and the finding of an higher risk of gastrointestinal disturbance suggest that a randomised controlled trial of routine transpyloric versus gastric tube feeding in preterm infants is not a priority. The lack of trial data on the effect of transpyloric feeding on preventing or treating gastro-oesophageal reflux-attributed apnoea/bradycardia means that a randomised controlled trial in this select population may be considered appropriate by clinicians and families.</P>

<P>Setting: University of Edinburgh, 1982-1984</P>
<P>There were statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the 2 cohorts that may have affected clinical outcomes. The group of infants who were allocated to nasoduodenal feeding were of statistically significantly lower gestational age, and had statistically significantly lower Apgar scores at 1 minute and at 5 minutes. It seems unlikely that these differences were due to chance. We consider that because of the lack of allocation concealment it is likely that some of the less mature and sicker infants were allocated preferentially to nasoduodenal feeding<BR/>
