<P>A systematic review of the data from randomised controlled trials provides no evidence that routine thyroid hormone therapy is effective in preventing problems in preterm babies or improves their developmental outcomes. Thyroid hormones are needed for the normal growth and maturity of the central nervous system, as well as the heart and lungs. Children born without sufficient thyroid hormones can develop serious mental retardation. It is believed that low levels of thyroid hormones in the first few weeks after birth (transient hyperthyroxinaemia) in preterm babies born before 34 weeks may contribute to this abnormal development. The review of trials found no evidence that using thyroid hormones routinely in preterm babies is effective in reducing the risk of problems caused by transiently low levels of thyroid hormones.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Observational studies have shown an association between transiently low thyroid hormone levels in preterm infants in the first weeks of life (transient hypothyroxinaemia) and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome. Thyroid hormone replacement might prevent this. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether prophylactic thyroid hormones given to preterm infants without congenital hypothyroidism result in clinically important changes in neonatal and long term outcomes. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, and searches of abstracts of conference proceedings, citations of published articles and expert informants. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation in which prophylactic thyroid hormone treatment was compared to control in premature infants. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data, using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD), were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four studies enrolling 318 infants were included. All studies enrolled preterm infants on the basis of gestational age criteria. All studies commenced treatment in the first 48 hours, but used different regimens, dose and durations of treatment. All four studies used thyroxine (T4). Valerio 2004 incorporated one arm with an early short course of T3, then T4 for 6 weeks. Only two studies with neurodevelopmental follow-up were of good methodology (van Wassenaer 1997; Vanhole 1997). All studies were small with the largest (van Wassenaer 1997) enrolling 200 infants. </P>
<P>No significant difference was found in neonatal morbidity, mortality or neurodevelopmental outcome in infants who received thyroid hormones compared to control. van Wassenaer 1997 reported no significant difference in abnormal mental development at 6, 12, 24 months (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.28, 1.56) or five years (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.22, 1.99) or cerebral palsy assessed at five years (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.28, 1.84). Meta-analysis of two studies (van Wassenaer 1997, Vanhole 1997) found no significant difference in the Bayley MDI (WMD -1.14, 95% CI -5.46, 3.19) and PDI (WMD 0.22, 95% CI -4.80, 5.24) at 7 - 12 months. van Wassenaer 1997 reported no significant difference in the Bayley MDI (MD -3.50, 95% CI -11.21, 4.21) and PDI (MD 3.10, 95% CI -3.31, 9.51) at 24 months, IQ scores at 5 years (MD -2.10, 95% CI -7.91, 3.71) and children in special schooling at 10 years (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43, 1.83). Meta-analysis of all four trials found no significant difference in mortality to discharge (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.24). van Wassenaer 1997 reported no significant difference in death or cerebral palsy at five years (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.14). No significant differences were reported for neonatal morbidities, including the need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, air leak, CLD in survivors at 28 days or 36 weeks, intraventricular haemorrhage, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis or retinopathy of prematurity. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review does not support the use of prophylactic thyroid hormones in preterm infants to reduce neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. An adequately powered clinical trial of thyroid hormone supplementation with the goal of preventing the postnatal nadir of thyroid hormone levels seen in very preterm infants is required. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-10 15:45:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In preterm infants, levels of serum T4 and free T4 in the first days after birth vary directly with gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>). However, unlike term infants, the concentrations of T4 and free T4 decrease to reach a nadir between day 10 and 14 after birth that is more severe at lower gestations and birth weights (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>). Thyroid hormone levels then tend to return to normal levels after three weeks, but continue to increase up to six to eight weeks after birth (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK> found the incidence of infants with severely depressed T4 values (below 4 mg/dL) ranged from 40% at 23 weeks gestation to 10.2% at 28 weeks gestation. Furthermore, the levels of T4 and free T4 found in premature infants are lower than those seen in the normal fetus at similar gestational ages (<LINK REF="REF-Ballabio-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballabio 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorpe_x002d_Beeston-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpe-Beeston 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radunovic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radunovic 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some infants, low thyroid hormone levels may be manifest at birth (as measured in cord blood samples) and some infants may have a reduced postnatal surge of thyroid hormones in the first hours after birth. The levels of thyroid hormones in cord blood including T4, free T4 (FT4) and T3 are lowest in those infants born at the lowest gestations, with cord blood T4 and FT4 two to three-fold higher in term infants than those born at 25 to 27 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Oden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oden 2002</LINK>). In a cohort study, <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK> reported that sick infants (with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation) failed to have the normal first day total T4 surge, had a FT4 surge that was quantitatively less than seen in healthy infants, had cord blood T3 levels similar to healthy infants, but had a T3 surge that was lower than in the healthy group. Low levels cord blood T3, free T3 and FT4 have also been reported in premature infants born to preeclamptic mothers with placental insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Belet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belet 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>This period of low thyroid hormone levels in infants born prematurely has been termed "transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity" (low T4, normal thyrotropin [TSH]). Suggestions as to the cause of these low thyroid hormone values include an immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in the extremely premature infant or a form of "nonthyroidal illness" (the "sick euthyroid syndrome") reflecting the infant's response to severe illness (monograph review by <LINK REF="REF-Paneth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paneth 1998</LINK>). Risk factors for transient hypothyroxinaemia reported in observational studies have included lower gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2004</LINK>), maternal pre-eclampsia with placental insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Belet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belet 2003</LINK>), fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Uhrmann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhrmann 1981</LINK>), perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Tahirovic-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tahirovic 1994</LINK>), respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Uhrmann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhrmann 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1986</LINK>), more severe respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>), mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>), low diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>) and dopamine infusions (<LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>). Adverse neonatal outcomes associated with transient hypothyroxinaemia have included intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2000</LINK>), chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>) and death (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transient hypothyroidism (low T4, high TSH concentration) occurs in up to 5% of neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>), 0.4% of infants with birth weights &lt; 1500 g (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1996</LINK>) and 1.8% of infants born &lt; 29 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest that this may be due to exposure to iodine-containing antiseptics used in neonatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Linder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linder 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thyroid hormones are necessary for the normal growth and maturation of the central nervous system (monograph reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Porterfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porterfield 1993</LINK> and Bernal 1995). Congenital hypothyroidism is strongly associated with abnormal neurodevelopment. Neurological cretinism in its severest form is characterised by profound mental retardation, deaf mutism, spastic diplegia and squint (<LINK REF="REF-Porterfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porterfield 1993</LINK>). Even children who receive early thyroid hormone replacement therapy for congenital hypothyroidism have motor and cognitive deficits that persist to late childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Kooistra-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kooistra 1994</LINK>). Infants born prematurely also have a high incidence of motor and cognitive deficits that are worse at lower gestations (<LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1998</LINK>). The question is whether the transient decrease in serum concentration of free T4 that occurs in some preterm infants during the first weeks after birth contributes to these neurodevelopmental problems. Three cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1992</LINK>; den Ouden 1996; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>) have documented an association between low thyroid hormone levels (T3 or T4) in the first weeks after birth and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome. All three cohorts documented a measure of abnormal mental development in children who had low neonatal thyroid hormone levels. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>) found a 4.4 fold increase in risk of disabling cerebral palsy at two years. <LINK REF="REF-Den-Ouden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Ouden 1996</LINK> in the same cohort found children who had low neonatal T4 levels to have an increased risk of school failure at nine years. The associations in the cohorts persisted despite correction for potential confounders including gestation, measures of fetal growth (either birth weight or presence of growth restriction) and, in some studies, many factors relating to severity of illness in preterm infants and independent risk factors for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>Whether transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is a causative factor for abnormal neurodevelopment is uncertain. Transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is strongly correlated with low gestation and is more frequent in infants with respiratory distress syndrome and in ventilated infants. It may be that transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is secondary to low gestation and/or illness severity in preterm infants. It is possible that other factors which are responsible for the abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants have not been taken into account adequately in the cohort studies.</P>
<P>This review examined the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants for improvement of neonatal outcomes and neurodevelopment. Thyroid hormones have effects not only on neurological development, but also on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and somatic growth. Therefore, studies that examined either neonatal morbidity, mortality and/or long term neurodevelopment were eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether thyroid hormone therapy used prophylactically in preterm infants thought to be at risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia, without congenital hypothyroidism or known transient hypothyroxinaemia, results in clinically important changes in neonatal and long term outcomes in terms of both benefits and harms. </P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of the trials was prespecified to investigate the evidence for the use of different thyroid hormone preparations, doses and timing of treatment; evidence for a gestational specific effect of treatment; and evidence for differences in effect according to study quality. Separate reviews address the use of postnatal thyroid hormones for respiratory distress in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>), and postnatal thyroid hormones for treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007b</LINK>). </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), PREMEDLINE (March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences (SPR-PAS and PSANZ 1998 - 2005), expert informants (authors of published trials and neonatologists), and journal handsearching in the English language.</P>
<P>MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006) was searched using MeSH terms '(infant-newborn or infant-premature) and (thyroxine or triiodothyronine)' and text words using '(hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine) and [MeSH terms] (infant-newborn or infant-premature)'. EMBASE (1980 to March 2006) and PREMEDLINE using terms '(hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine) and newborn. The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials was searched using the term 'thyroid disease', and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using 'thyroxine or triiodothyronine or hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia'.

<P>Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data, using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) was performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group. Each identified trial was assessed for methodological quality with respect to:<BR/>a) masking of allocation<BR/>b) masking of intervention<BR/>c) completeness of follow up<BR/>d) masking of outcome assessment.<BR/>Authors of studies were contacted were details of methodology are unclear. Data was synthesized where appropriate using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) for benefits and the number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse effects will be calculated. All results given will include the 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise stated. Heterogeneity was looked for using the chi-square statistic for heterogeneity, quantified using the I-squared statistic. The source of heterogeneity was examined in subgroup analysis of type of infant enrolled, treatment strategy and methodological quality as specified below. Where no heterogeneity existed, infants enrolled and interventions were similar, and there is no apparent heterogeneity, the fixed effect analysis was reported. In a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>), authors of studies were contacted where details of methodology or results were unclear and were provided by the authors of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK>).</P>

Level of all thyroid hormones except T3 were not significantly different after cessation of treatment on day 56. T3 levels were still significantly lower on day 56 in the treated infants. Actual numbers of infants with levels above and below the reference ranges were not reported. Reference ranges were not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK> reported T4, T3, rT3, TSH and TBG in infants treated with T4 20 &#956;g/kg/day for two weeks.

<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>Significance of findings: </B>Four studies were included in this review examining the effects of prophylactic postnatal thyroid hormones in preterm infants. All studies gave postnatal thyroid hormones to preterm infants on the basis of gestational age and/or birthweight criteria. No significant benefits were reported in terms of neurodevelopmental outcomes, mortality or neonatal morbidities by any study and no significant benefits were found in meta-analysis for any outcome. The studies used a variety of different dosing strategies with only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK>) incorporating the same dose and duration using T4 8 &#956;g/kg/day from day one to 42. Higher dose but shorter duration thyroxine courses were given by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK> who used T4 10-20 &#956;g/kg/day from day two to 21 and <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK> who used 20 &#956;g/kg/day from day one to 14. No significant clinical benefits were reported by any of these studies. <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK> also reported neurodevelopmental outcomes that were not significantly different. <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK> has now followed developmental and school outcomes at five and 10 years of age with no significant benefits from use of prophylactic thyroxine reported. Separate reviews also reported the use of postnatal thyroid hormones for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>) and in preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007b</LINK>). Neither review found any evidence of benefit from use of thyroid hormones in terms of neonatal morbidities or mortality. However, no additional data were found examining the effects of thyroid hormones on longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes. </P>
<P>One study used triiodothyronine (<LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK> enrolled infants &lt; 28 weeks gestation to a course of combined T3 0.5 &#956;g/kg day one and T4 8 &#956;g/kg/day from day one to 42. Again, no significant clinical benefits were reported although neurodevelopment was not reported. </P>
<P>This review examines the clinical effect of prophylactic thyroid hormone therapy. An analysis of the effect of thyroid hormone supplementation on thyroid hormone levels was also undertaken. The analysis found that whereas most studies measured total thyroid hormone levels, only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>) measured biologically active thyroid hormones, free T3 or free T4. Rates of infants with levels above or below reference ranges were not reported by any study. In studies using thyroxine, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK> reported that free T4 was increased compared to controls from day 7 to 21 after administration of thyroxine 10-20 &#956;g/kg/day from day two for 21 days; <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK> reported a significant increase in free T4 day three to 14 but not free T3 after administration of thyroxine 8 &#956;g/kg/day for 42 days. Studies reported variable changes in total T4 levels with thyroxine administration. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK>) reported a significant increase during treatment with thyroxine. <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK> reported an increase that was not statistically significant. Levels of free T3 were reported as unchanged in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK>) with thyroxine treatment. Levels of total T3 were reported as unchanged in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK>) but decreased during treatment in another study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>) with thyroxine treatment. All studies reported thyroid hormone levels returning to levels seen in controls after cessation of treatment. One study used triiodothyronine. <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK> used T3 on day 1 and reported significant increases in levels of total T3 up to 6 hours after infusion but no significant difference in free T3 levels. In summary, administration of thyroid hormones to preterm infants results in increases in total T3 or total T4 levels depending on which thyroid hormone is administered. Free T4 levels may be increased by the administration of thyroxine but free T3 levels have not been demonstrated to change in response to thyroxine or triiodothyronine. Rates of low and high thyroid hormone levels were not reported. </P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of the review: </B>For primary outcomes, limited comparable data were available for meta-analytic pooling of results for neurodevelopment, but data were complete for all studies with respect to mortality to discharge. Major limitations of this review include the small number of infants enrolled in trials incorporated in the review resulting in limited power to detect moderate but clinically important differences in effect of thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants. Studies used different treatments, doses and enrolment criteria which limits the ability to make conclusions from pooled results. </P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of studies: </B>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanhole-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vanhole 1997</LINK>) with adequate neurodevelopmental follow up were of good methodology. <LINK REF="STD-Valerio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valerio 2004</LINK> was of good methodology but did not report neurodevelopmental outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2000</LINK> had more infants randomised to the treatment group (29 versus 20). The largest study with 200 infants, <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>, reported a subgroup analysis according to gestational strata. As there were potentially clinically significant differences in neonatal risk factors in the two groups after randomisation, with fewer infants &lt; 27 weeks and more infants &lt; 3rd percentile for weight in the treatment group, and the subgroup analysis was not prespecified by the investigators, this analysis has not been reported in this review. </P>
<P>There is no apparent heterogeneity in the findings of the different studies. The conclusions are not altered by excluding studies with inadequate methodology. The review finds no evidence of benefit from any individual thyroid hormone preparation, dose, timing or duration of treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a gestational age dependent effect of thyroid hormone supplementation as suggested by one study's authors (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>). Further research is needed to determine if prophylactic treatment with thyroid hormones to prevent the postnatal nadir in thyroid hormone levels results in improved neonatal and long term outcomes. Questions that require answering include which thyroid hormones should be supplemented and at what dose. It is unclear whether both substrate T4 and active T3 need to be supplemented to achieve 'normal' levels of biologically active hormones. It is also unclear whether fetal or neonatal levels of thyroid hormones should be targeted in the first weeks. Although low levels of thyroid hormones have been associated with adverse neonatal and long term developmental outcomes, it is unclear whether this effect is causal or an association. It is possible that low levels of thyroid hormones are an attempt to protect the sick infant by reducing the metabolic rate at a time of stress or illness. In a related review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>), no benefit was found from the use of higher dose thyroid hormone supplementation to mimic the postnatal thyroid hormone surge that occurs after birth, although currently reported trials of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are underpowered to detect a clinically important difference. Prophylactic thyroid hormones should only be used in the context of adequately designed clinical trials. An adequately powered clinical trial that measures the effect on long term neurodevelopmental outcomes will be required before prophylactic thyroid hormones are used routinely in clinical practice in preterm infants without congenital hypothyroidism. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review does not support the use of prophylactic thyroid hormones in preterm infants to reduce neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed to determine optimal thyroid hormone treatment and dosing strategy. An adequately powered clinical trial of thyroid hormone supplementation with the goal of preventing the postnatal nadir of thyroid hormone levels seen in very preterm infants is required. The trial should be powered to detect clinically important differences in long term neurodevelopment and behavioural outcomes. </P>
