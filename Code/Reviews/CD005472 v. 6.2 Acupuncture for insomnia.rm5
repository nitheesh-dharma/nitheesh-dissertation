<P>Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. This review was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in treating insomnia. Thirty-three randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, involving 2293 participants. We considered all studies to have a high risk of bias. They were diverse in the types of participants, acupuncture treatments and sleep outcome measures used, which limited our ability to draw reliable conclusions. Currently there is a lack of high-quality clinical evidence to inform us about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.</P>
<P>Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Insomnia may be defined as a complaint of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2005</LINK>). The revised edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders lists more than 100 differential diagnoses of insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>). The 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) defines primary insomnia as the subjective difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or non-restorative sleep that lasts for at least one month. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and is not associated with another mental disorder, substance-related disorder, general medical disorder or other specific sleep disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A review on the epidemiology of insomnia found that the prevalence of insomnia symptoms that occurred at least three nights per week or often or always occurred was between 16% and 21% (<LINK REF="REF-Ohayon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohayon 2002</LINK>). The prevalence of insomnia symptoms with daytime consequences ranged from 9% to 15%, while 8% to 18% of the population had dissatisfaction with sleep quality and quantity. The prevalence of insomnia diagnoses according to the DSM-IV classification was 6%. Primary insomnia was the most frequent diagnosis, with prevalence ranging between 2% and 4%, followed by insomnia related to another mental disorder, with prevalence ranging from 1% to 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Ohayon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohayon 2002</LINK>). Insomnia may result in fatigue, irritability and impaired concentration and is associated with reduced quality of life, increased risk of traffic accidents, impaired job performance and absenteeism (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2004</LINK>). The economic impact of insomnia is high, with an estimated total cost ranging from USD 30 to 35 billion annually in 1994 (<LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 1996</LINK>). A review found that the six-month predicted direct and indirect costs for adults with insomnia were USD 1253 greater than that for matched control without insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Ozminkowski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozminkowski 2007</LINK>). For the elderly with insomnia, it was USD 1143 greater than that for matched non-insomniacs (<LINK REF="REF-Ozminkowski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozminkowski 2007</LINK>). A more recent review found that the annual mean incremental costs to employers were USD 2053 greater for employees with insomnia compared with controls (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2009</LINK>). In addition, there is a strong relationship between insomnia and depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders, alcohol and drug abuse or dependence, suicide and decreased immune functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007</LINK>). Insomnia might also be a risk factor for obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2008</LINK>), hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Knutson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanfranchi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanfranchi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vgontzas-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vgontzas 2009a</LINK>), diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Vgontzas-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vgontzas 2009b</LINK>), cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-King-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2008</LINK>) and mortality but the data are inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007</LINK>). It is important to evaluate and treat insomnia early, since acute untreated insomnia can progress into chronic insomnia that might be more difficult to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ancoli-Israel 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:53:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The general approach in the management of insomnia is to evaluate the cause of the symptom before an appropriate treatment is proposed. The underlying medical, psychiatric or behavioural causes of insomnia are usually treated in the first place (<LINK REF="REF-Hajak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajak 2000</LINK>). However, it is not always possible to abolish or alleviate the primary disease process. In such situations, the approach is to focus on interventions that will positively promote sleep. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, physicians treating sleep disorders almost always counsel patients about sleep hygiene. Some key sleep hygiene instructions include regular bedtime and wake up time, avoiding daytime napping, using the bedroom only for sleep, keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature throughout the night, practising a bedtime ritual, getting regular exercise each day, avoiding alcohol and nicotine four to six hours before bedtime, avoiding caffeine entirely or limiting caffeine use to no more than three cups no later than 10 a.m., and avoiding heavy meals and strenuous exercise in the evening (<LINK REF="REF-Zarcone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarcone 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent review found types of psychological and behavioural treatment including cognitive behavioural therapy, stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training and paradoxical intention to have empirical evidence for the treatment of insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 2006</LINK>). However, such non-pharmacological therapies have remained largely under-utilised in primary care, perhaps because they are time consuming and require significant training for effective implementation (<LINK REF="REF-Krystal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krystal 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many prescription and over-the-counter medications are available for treating insomnia. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are the only agents currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of insomnia. There are two broad groups of benzodiazepine receptor agonists: benzodiazepines and the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g. zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone). Although insomnia is often a chronic condition, the FDA has only approved eszopiclone for use without a specified time limit. The other medications have approved use limited to 35 days or less. The limits on prescription of these medications are due to concerns about its potential for abuse, dependence and adverse effects, such as residual daytime sedation, cognitive impairment and poor motor co-ordination (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2005</LINK>). Faced with the limitations of pharmacological and psychological treatments of insomnia, many alternative therapies have been used to treat insomnia and acupuncture is one of the commonly used treatment modalities.</P>
<P>Acupuncture is well accepted by many people and is widely used in treating various illnesses including back pain, arthritis, headache, asthma, digestive disorders, alcohol and substance dependence, and other psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1999</LINK>). Acupuncture is one of the most commonly used complementary therapies in many Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zollman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zollman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acupuncture is a procedure in which specific body areas, the acupoints (also called meridian points), are pierced with fine needles for therapeutic purposes. Acupoints are points on the body surface that when stimulated are thought to cause therapeutic effects. Acupuncture is one of the major modalities of treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Its theory of diagnosis and treatment is based on the systems of medicine and philosophy of ancient China and its use in China can be traced back more than 2000 years (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1996</LINK>). Acupuncture involves complex theories of regulation of Yin and Yang forces, Qi (air), blood and body fluids. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine an imbalance in the Yin and Yang forces of the body, or an excess or a deficiency of Qi, blood or body fluids, are the main causes of pain or diseases. Acupuncture treats illness by recreating the balance between the Yin and Yang forces and restoration of normal Qi, blood and body fluids through stimulation of different acupoints which govern different parts of the body and their interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Maciocia-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciocia 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from traditional needle acupuncture, various forms of acupuncture have been developed, including electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, acupressure, auricular therapy, magnetic acupressure and transcutaneous electrical acupoints stimulation (TEAS). Electroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which acupuncture needles are attached to a device that generates continuous electric pulses, generating a small electric current that flows between pairs of needles. Laser acupuncture employs laser beam to stimulate the acupoints instead of stimulation using fine needles. Acupressure is a technique that involves firm manual pressure on the acupoints. Auricular therapy employs acupuncture needles, seeds or magnetic peals to stimulate the acupoints located on the auricles. Magnetic acupressure employs small magnets to provide pressure and magnetic stimulation of acupoints. TEAS combines the technique of both acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation by using electrode pads placed on the skin to stimulate the acupoints.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The exact physiological or biochemical mechanisms by which acupuncture might improve sleep are not completely understood. However, many studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses (<LINK REF="REF-Ulett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulett 1998</LINK>). A review article has summarised how the nervous system, neurotransmitters and endogenous substances could respond to needling stimulation and electroacupuncture, thereby mediating pain relief and other therapeutics (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2004</LINK>). Acupuncture causes stimulation of the opiodergic neurons in rats resulting in increased concentrations of beta-endorphin which might have a sleep promoting effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2009</LINK>). Acupuncture is also found to increase melatonin secretion, which is associated with improvement in sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Spence-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 2004</LINK>). Stimulation of certain acupoints is found to increase nitric oxide in the brain and the blood, which is associated with sleep improvement clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>). Acupuncture can also cause up-regulation of an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that may promote sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Fu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 2009</LINK>). Acupuncture also results in modulation of the autonomic nervous system, affecting both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, which may be associated with its sleep-promoting effect (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acupuncture is widely used for treatment of insomnia. Anecdotal reports suggest that acupuncture may improve sleep and relieve insomnia. Many clinical trials have also been performed to study the efficacy of acupuncture for insomnia. It remains uncertain whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to reach a definitive conclusion. For this reason, we undertook a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of acupuncture therapy for insomnia in 2006. However, this question is still unanswered and we performed an update of the review to look for new evidence.</P>

<P>We summarised data using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes, analysing with the inverse variance method. All analyses included all participants in the treatment groups to which they were allocated, provided that data were available.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When cross-over trials were included in the meta-analysis, we needed to use the correct unit of analysis to avoid bias. Where appropriate, the results of the cross-over trials would be combined with results of parallel-group trials. When the results of cross-over trials were combined in meta-analyses with results from parallel trials, we would use the inverse variance methods recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). We would use the presented data within the first phase only if data available from a cross-over trial were restricted.</P>
<P>If there were two different control groups in a trial of parallel-group design, e.g. one sham control and one no treatment control, pair-wise comparison results would be separately reported under different comparisons, e.g. acupuncture versus sham control and acupuncture versus no treatment, as stated in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> section above. If there were two different intervention groups, e.g. one acupuncture group and one electroacupuncture group, pair-wise comparison results would be reported under different subgroups of intervention in a particular comparison, and their results would not be combined into a single summary measure, but only subgroup summaries would be presented, to preserve the identification of different intervention subgroups, as well as to avoid incorrect unit of analysis.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2012-06-13 10:32:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We contacted authors of included studies to supply missing information on study methods, participants, intervention and control, follow-up data, outcome data and statistical summary indices such as means and standard deviations. We assessed missing data and dropouts/attrition for each included study, and we assessed the extent to which the results/conclusions of the review could be altered by the missing data in sensitivity analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we would impute the missing data in the best-case scenario and the worst-case scenario to assess whether the missing data could have caused clinically relevant bias in the result. For continuous outcomes, we would impute the missing data as the most extreme values observed in the trial (also as best and worst-case scenarios) or as two standard deviations away from the means if extreme values were not available, to assess whether the missing data could have caused clinically relevant bias in the result.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed clinical heterogeneity by noting the difference in the distribution of important participant factors between trials (age, gender, specific diagnosis/diagnostic subtypes, duration of disorder, associated diseases), and assessed methodological heterogeneity by noting different trial design factors (randomisation concealment, blinding, losses to follow-up, treatment type, co-interventions). We assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2009</LINK>), a quantity that describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error.</P>
<P>Thresholds for the interpretation of I<SUP>2</SUP> could be misleading, since the importance of inconsistency depends on several factors. A rough guide to interpretation is as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>0% to 40%: might not be important;</LI>
<LI>30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.</LI>

<P>We generated funnel plots (effect size against standard error) if sufficient studies (more than five) were found for the same outcome. Asymmetry could be due to publication bias, but could also be due to a relationship between trial size and effect size.

<P>If there were multiple publications reporting on the same trial, only one set of data was included and analysed. We contacted authors for information about multiple publications in case of doubts.</P>
<P>Language bias might occur if inclusion of studies in a systematic review was limited by certain language of publication. There was no language restriction in the current review. However, we have not exhaustively searched for studies published in certain languages in local journals not indexed in the databases that we searched and language bias might still have occurred.</P>

Assessment bias was also possible if the outcome assessors were not blinded to the treatment groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were a total of 33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the current review. They evaluated different forms of acupuncture (needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure and magnetic acupressure) with or without additional treatment compared to sham or placebo control or no specific treatment. For the primary outcome, frequency of improvement in sleep quality, we found that when compared with no specific treatment, acupressure was associated with mild to moderate improvement in sleep quality (two studies). When compared with sham or placebo, acupressure also appeared to be associated with mild to moderate improvement in sleep quality (two studies). However, sensitivity analysis suggested that the beneficial effect was inconclusive if dropouts were taken into consideration. When evaluating the intervention as an adjunct to other treatment compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture (including needle acupuncture (11 studies) and electroacupuncture (two studies)) as an adjunct to other treatment mildly increased the proportion of people with improved sleep quality. However, in the subgroup analyses, only needle acupuncture, not electroacupuncture, showed conclusive benefit.</P>
<P>The results for secondary outcomes were mixed but most did not show clinically relevant or consistent benefits of acupuncture. Compared with no specific treatment, acupressure showed no clinically relevant benefit in total sleep duration (one study). Although primary analyses suggested participants who received acupuncture (including electroacupuncture (one study) and acupressure (five studies)) might have a better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, sensitivity analyses demonstrated no consistent benefit if dropouts were assumed to have a poor outcome. Acupressure might be associated with clinically relevant benefit on another sleep score. However, this was reported by one study only and we were uncertain whether the sleep score in this study was a validated measure. Acupressure showed no clinically relevant benefit on quality of life.</P>
<P>Compared to sham or placebo, acupuncture showed no clinically relevant benefit in most sleep parameters, including sleep onset latency (needle acupuncture (one study), electroacupuncture (one study), acupressure (three studies) and magnetic acupressure (one study)), number of awakenings (acupressure (two studies) and magnetic acupressure (two studies)), arousal index (acupressure (one study)) and sleep efficiency (electroacupuncture (one study), acupressure (three studies) and magnetic acupressure (two studies)). There was some evidence that needle acupuncture might result in clinically relevant improvement in total sleep duration, but this was based on one study only. Magnetic acupressure might reduce total wake time (one study), but sensitivity analysis on worst-case scenario for dropouts showed no consistent, clinically relevant benefit. Acupuncture also did not show clinically relevant benefit in most sleep scores, including PSQI (electroacupuncture (one study) and acupressure (six studies)), ISI (needle acupuncture (two studies) and electroacupuncture (one study)), AIS (needle acupuncture (two studies) and acupressure (one study)), SQS (acupressure (one study)), and sleep quality score (electroacupuncture (one study)). Only needle acupuncture showed consistent, clinically relevant benefit in the sleep quality score on the Morning Questionnaire. However, this was reported by just one study. Acupuncture did not result in a clinically relevant benefit in daytime functioning (electroacupuncture (one study)) or quality of life (acupressure (two studies)).</P>
<P>Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment showed a clinically relevant benefit in total sleep duration (needle acupuncture and electroacupuncture). However, the benefit on sleep onset latency (needle acupuncture) was only modest with uncertain clinical relevance. There was no clinically relevant benefit on sleep efficiency or sleep score (needle acupuncture and electroacupuncture).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although 33 studies were included, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of acupuncture for insomnia was incomplete. Only 17 studies provided data on our pre-specified primary outcome, i.e. frequency of patients with improved sleep quality. What constituted improvement of sleep quality was variably defined in these studies or not clearly defined. This made the results difficult to interpret and apply. Many studies did not report outcomes on sleep parameters. For those that reported on these parameters, most relied on participants' subjective report instead of objective measurements and hence the validity and reliability of the reported sleep parameters were doubtful. Other clinically important outcomes such as daytime functioning and quality of life were reported in only a few studies. Due to the limited availability of valid and reliable outcomes in the included trials, the power of the current meta-analyses to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of acupuncture with respect to clinically important outcomes was limited.</P>
<P>In the majority of included studies the participants' characteristics were not described in sufficient detail. We did not know the causes of insomnia in the participants and whether the participants had comorbid physical or psychological symptoms that might have affected their response to treatment. Many studies did not describe the duration of insomnia or the treatments that participants had previously received. Therefore we cannot draw any conclusions related to the effects of acupuncture on different population groups.</P>
<P>The duration of follow-up was short in all included studies. This might partially explain why a large proportion of studies had no dropouts. Whether acupuncture is efficacious in the long run is uncertain and needs further investigations.</P>
<P>Only a few studies reported adverse effects of acupuncture. It is uncertain whether adverse effects were entirely absent in the other trials or if there has been a failure to report them. Although adverse effects were not among the primary objectives of the individual trials focusing on the efficacy of acupuncture, it is considered unethical not to report adverse effects that occur during the trial. Furthermore, all trials included only small numbers of participants, so rare adverse effects might not have been experienced. We therefore do not have any evidence to inform us as to whether the potential benefits of acupuncture outweigh the potential risks.</P>
<P>There were no randomised controlled trials on acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment compared with placebo/sham acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment. Therefore we could not answer the question of whether acupuncture is an effective adjunctive treatment for insomnia. There were also no randomised controlled trials on certain forms of acupuncture such as laser acupuncture or auricular therapy and so the effectiveness of these types of acupuncture could not be evaluated.</P>
<P>Adverse events were only reported in a few trials and there were only a small number of minor adverse events that occurred. Although the existing literature on acupuncture in patients with insomnia and patients with a variety of other conditions has found that acupuncture is a relatively safe treatment modality which obviates the side effects of sleeping pills, acupuncture is not without risks. Numerous very serious adverse effects of acupuncture have been reported. Apart from pain, there are occasional instances of infections and inappropriate needle placement causing inadvertent damage. Acupressure or electrical or magnetic stimulation of acupoints might cause less pain and might be safer as no breach of skin occurs. However, excessive pressure applied to skin for a long period might result in tissue ischaemia or necrosis and electrical or magnetic stimulation might have other untoward effects. Therefore, all forms of acupuncture should only be performed by a well-trained therapist who is experienced, understands the theories underpinning the practice of acupuncture, and takes the necessary precautions.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was poor, as all included studies were considered to have high risk of bias. Important potential biases in the studies included problems in sequence generation which might have led to some trials not being truly randomised. Allocation concealment and blinding were absent in most trials. These would likely result in an overestimation of treatment effects. As improvement in insomnia is largely subjective, proper randomisation concealment, blinding and standardised assessment of outcomes are extremely important. Some trials also had attrition and reporting biases. Baseline characteristics might not be comparable in several trials, making comparisons of outcomes prone to bias. Acupuncture methods used were not standardised or stratified within individual trials, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of a particular acupuncture protocol. We used funnel plots to assess publication bias, which appeared to be highly likely judging from the asymmetry. It was also noted that all the studies from mainland China had positive findings.</P>
<P>Many trials did not include a sham or placebo control group and therefore a placebo effect could not be excluded and the results of these trials might therefore be biased in favour of acupuncture. On the other hand, pragmatic trials without the use of sham or placebo acupuncture control can address different research questions. Although the non-acupoints selected in sham control may not produce the specific effects that the real acupoints do, the sham acupoints may still be physiologically active and may produce non-specific effects in addition to the placebo effects (<LINK REF="REF-Birch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 2003</LINK>). In other words, sham acupuncture might not be an entirely physiologically inert treatment and hence researchers need a larger sample size to detect a significant difference when a sham acupuncture control group is used. Similarly, placebo acupuncture, with needles attached to but not penetrating the skin surface on acupoints, can also have non-specific effects. Therefore, interpreting randomised controlled trials of complex physical therapies such as acupuncture has inherent difficulties, as placebo and Hawthorn effects can mask the results (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002</LINK>). Incidental factors are not clear in this type of study in contrast with pharmacological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2005</LINK>). In these non-pharmaceutical therapies the characteristic and incidental factors are intertwined and elements categorised as incidental in the context of drug trials are integral to complex non-pharmaceutical interventions such as acupuncture. Therefore, the choice of a randomised design with pragmatic characteristics is important (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some results had wide confidence intervals encompassing both positive and negative effects and were therefore inconclusive. The included studies were heterogeneous with respect to participant characteristics (age and gender of patients, underlying cause for insomnia and co-morbidities), type of acupuncture, acupoints used, treatment regimen and duration, co-interventions, control treatment and outcome measures. Therefore, only a small number of studies could be grouped together for analysis. Even then the studies within each analysis were heterogeneous with respect to patient population, acupoints used, treatment regimen and duration, and outcome definition. Therefore, it is impossible to draw any robust conclusions on the effectiveness of a particular acupuncture regimen for a particular patient population.</P>
<P>The definition of insomnia varied among the studies. There was no precise clinical diagnosis of insomnia. Some studies recruited participants who had a complaint of insomnia, whilst others used validated questionnaires or diagnostic criteria. The variation in the diagnosis of insomnia further increased the baseline differences among the studies and made the results difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>In addition, none of the trials provided a calculation of sample size before initiation of recruitment, and most of the studies were small with fewer than 100 participants, limiting the precision of effect size estimates and generalisability of the results. In addition, multiple comparisons with vast numbers of secondary outcome measures had inflated the alpha errors and hence the probability of false positive results.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-06-13 10:45:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>We searched extensively in the international and Chinese literature. The current review is therefore more comprehensive than existing reviews, and it is likely that the majority of relevant studies were identified. However, studies that were not published in English or Chinese might have been missed. Information contained in the published reports of included trials was often inadequate and only a few authors responded to our enquiries about missing information. The missing information might potentially cause bias in this review. On the other hand, we tried to reduce the risk of bias in the current review by excluding quasi-randomised controlled trials which are at higher risk of bias compared to truly randomised controlled trials. The study selection, data collection and analyses fully adhered to the pre-defined protocol, which should have further reduced bias. However, we identified significant risk of bias in most of the included studies and therefore the results derived from meta-analyses of these trials were susceptible to bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There are other systematic reviews of acupuncture or acupressure in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Cao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalavapalli-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalavapalli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2009b</LINK>). These reviews had different inclusion and exclusion criteria and therefore included different sets of primary studies for analyses. However, most reviews had a similar conclusion, namely that there is no high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of various forms of acupuncture for treatment of insomnia.</P>
<P>Only one review (<LINK REF="REF-Cao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cao 2009</LINK>) concluded that acupuncture appears to be effective in the treatment of insomnia. In the comparison of acupuncture versus no treatment in that review, meta-analysis of three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tsay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tsay 2004</LINK>) showed a better PSQI score (mean difference (MD) -3.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.10 to -0.46, P = 0.02). All three of these trials were also included in the current review (which included two additional trials published after the review by Cao (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reza-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reza 2010</LINK>)) and the results were similar. In the comparison of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in the review by Cao, meta-analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tsay 2003</LINK>) again showed better PSQI scores (MD -2.94, 95% CI -5.77 to -0.11, P = 0.04). These two trials were also included in the current review (which included four additional trials published later (<LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nordio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reza-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reza 2010</LINK>)) and the results were similar. In the comparison of acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment versus other treatment alone, the review by Cao separated the comparison into two, namely acupuncture as an adjunct to Western medicine versus Western medicine alone, and acupuncture as an adjunct to Chinese herbs versus Chinese herbs alone. In the comparison of acupuncture as an adjunct to Western medicine versus Western medicine alone, meta-analysis of three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ye-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ye 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2008</LINK>) showed a better PSQI score in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.81 to -1.24, P &lt; 0.00001). Meta-analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2005a</LINK>) showed better total sleep duration in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD 1.09, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.61, P &lt; 0.0001). Meta-analysis of four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2006a</LINK>) showed a higher likelihood of sleeping for more than three hours in the intervention group compared to the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71, P = 0.03). In the comparison of acupuncture as an adjunct to Chinese herbs versus Chinese herbs alone, meta-analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Du-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Du 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 1998</LINK>) showed a higher likelihood of sleeping efficiency above 60% in the intervention group compared to the control group (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.50, P = 0.01). Two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2008</LINK>) in these comparisons of acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment versus other treatment alone were excluded in the current review because of pseudo-randomisation. We also did not include the outcomes of the frequency of people achieving sleep duration above three hours or sleep efficiency above 60%. In the current review, we showed similar improvement in PSQI score and total sleep duration in the group that received acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment compared to other treatment alone. </P>
<P>Despite similar results in meta-analyses in all comparisons between the review by Cao and the current review, the interpretation or results and conclusion were different. In the review by Cao, methodological quality of the included trials was assessed in a different way. Seven criteria were used: 1. clear description of population, setting, interventions and comparison groups; 2. appropriate measurement of outcomes; 3. appropriate statistical and analytical methods; 4. no reporting errors; 5. less than 20% dropouts; 6. clear reporting of dropouts; and 7. appropriate consideration and adjustment for potential confounders. According to these seven criteria, primary studies were categorised as good, fair or poor. However, how these seven criteria were integratively judged to the three categories of overall assessment was not clearly described and which study was assigned to which category was not reported in the review. Hence it was not clear whether the apparently better results in the acupuncture groups were based on good primary studies or not. In addition, the effect size and its clinical relevance was not considered in the Cao review, and no sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results with respect to the dropouts. The conclusion in the Cao review was also based on positive results only, disregarding the negative results in multiple other outcomes that showed no significant difference between the intervention and the control groups. All existing systematic reviews, including the review by Cao, suggested that further rigorously designed RCTs were warranted.</P>
<P>The effect size of acupuncture compared to other treatment modalities was similar in some outcomes. In a systematic review on sedative hypnotics for older people with insomnia, benzodiazepines were associated with an increase in total sleep duration by 34 minutes on average compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 2005</LINK>). When all sedatives were combined, total sleep duration was 25 minutes longer in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. This appeared similar to the results of the current review. However, the number of awakenings was lowered by a mean of only 0.6 in those who received sedatives or benzodiazepines compared with placebo. This was significantly lower than the improvement in the number of awakenings (2.9 to 4.1) found in the current review for acupuncture compared with placebo. In another systematic review on cognitive behavioural therapy for people above 60 years old with insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2009</LINK>), sleep onset latency was reduced by an average of three minutes in the intervention group compared to the control group, which was similar to the effect size of acupuncture in the current review. Total sleep duration and sleep efficiency were increased by an average of 7.5% and 32 minutes respectively in people who received cognitive behavioural therapy compared to the control group, which were also similar to the effect size of acupuncture. Total wake time and wake after sleep onset were reduced by 62 minutes and 22 minutes respectively in people who received cognitive behavioural therapy, which were not markedly different from people who received acupuncture. PSQI score was reduced by 2.8 points in people who received cognitive behavioural therapy, which was slightly better than people who received acupuncture.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture to improve people's self rated sleep quality. Although some forms of acupuncture might improve sleep parameters in the short term in some people, the current evidence is not rigorous enough to allow recommendation to be made about the wide application of any form of acupuncture with or without additional therapies for the treatment of insomnia of any aetiology in people of any age group. The long-term effect of acupuncture is not known and its potential adverse effects are not entirely clear. People who seek to receive acupuncture for insomnia should be informed of the uncertainty of its effectiveness and potential risks.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-13 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Existing randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for treatment of insomnia are of small size and low methodological quality. Further high-quality studies of larger sample size are needed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating insomnia. Randomisation methods need to be more rigorous and concealed. Although blinding of the therapist who applied acupuncture might be very difficult, blinding of the patients, the other care providers and outcome assessors should be attempted as far as possible to minimise performance and assessment biases. In the current review, only three included studies achieved blinding of patients, care takers and outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Nordio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nordio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Suen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tsay 2003</LINK>). They employed sham acupuncture methods in the control group that were essentially indistinguishable from real acupuncture by lay people without good knowledge about genuine acupoints. We advise future studies to employ a similar design, such that only the acupuncturist knows who receives genuine acupuncture and who receives sham acupuncture; and the acupuncturist should not be involved in other aspects of participants' care or assessment of outcomes.</P>
<P>Analysis of outcomes based on intention-to-treat principle is important. All outcomes specified in the trial protocol should be reported. A standardised set of outcome measures is important for comparison among different trials. These should include measurements of sleep parameters objectively using actigraphy or polysomnography so that even if the person administering and receiving acupuncture is not blind, the outcome assessors could be blinded to treatment. Other well-known standardised sleep scores such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index could also be used. Daytime functioning and quality of life are also important outcomes to be included in future trials, and these should be measured using validated instruments. Adverse effects should be closely monitored prospectively and reported.</P>
<P>Since insomnia is a highly heterogeneous disease with different aetiology and severity, acupuncture is likely to have different effects on different subgroups of patients. Therefore, future clinical trials should be focused on a particular subgroup or include a very large sample size to delineate the effect of acupuncture on different types of patients. In addition, well-defined diagnostic criteria, such as DSM-IV or ICSD, should be employed to make a precise clinical diagnosis of insomnia, and hence increase the comparability between studies. Since insomnia may wax and wane with or without treatment, a longer follow-up period with serial measurements of outcomes is important to determine the genuine effectiveness of acupuncture and its long-term effect. It might also be worthwhile to further examine the effectiveness of combination therapy for insomnia using acupuncture with other non-pharmacological or pharmacological treatments.</P>

<P>Intervention group (electroacupuncture): acupuncture to the following acupoints: Yintang, Baihui, bilateral auricular Shenmen, Sishencong and Anmian, using disposable acupuncture needles. The acupoints on the head and ears were treated using 0.25 x 25 mm needles an 0.2 x 25 mm needles (Tai Chi, China), respectively. An irritating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling was achieved if possible. Surgical tape or hairpins were used to secure the needles. An electric stimulator (CE-FAR Acus II, Lurd, Sweden) was connected to the needles and delivered a constant current, 0.45 ms, square wave, brief pulse stimulus of 4 Hz frequency to the participants. The needles were left for 30 minutes. The acupuncture was performed by a licensed acupuncturist who had 2 years of experience in providing needle acupuncture. Treatment was given 3 times per week.<BR/>Control group (placebo acupuncture): acupoints same as intervention group were treated using placebo needles. The blunt needle was not fixed inside the copper handle. When its tip touched the skin, a pricking sensation was felt by the participant, thereby simulating the puncture of the skin. The needle moved inside the handle and appeared to be shortened. The needles were connected to the electric stimulator as in the intervention group.<BR/>Duration of treatment: 3 weeks</P>

Stainless steel needles of 0.35 mm diameter are inserted at a depth of 10 mm obliquely into Bai-Hui (Du-20) Shen-Ting (DU-24) and Si-Shen-Cong (EX-HN1), 10 mm straightly into San-Yin-Jiao (SP-6) and 5 mm straightly into Shen-Men (HT-7). In the day without acupuncture intervention one estazolam placebo tablet should be taken before sleep.<BR/>Group B: estazolam combined with sham acupuncture for 6 weeks. Sham acupuncture is conducted by stimulating 4 acupoints every other day: Bi-Nao (LI-14), Shou-San-li (LI-10), Yu-Ji (LU-10) and Feng-Shi (GB-31). Stainless steel needles of 0.35 mm diameter are inserted straightly at a depth of 10 mm into the 4 points. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, these 4 acupoints have no effect for insomnia. Estazolam dose is given 1 mg in the day without acupuncture intervention before sleep.<BR/>Group C: sham acupuncture with estazolam placebo tablet for 6 weeks. Sham acupuncture is conducted as the group B. In the day without acupuncture one estazolam placebo tablet should be taken before sleep.<BR/>

<P>Traditional acupuncture: experimental patients will be treated at bilateral Ear Shenmen, Sishencong EX-HN1, Anmian and unilateral Yintang EX-HN3 and Baihui GV20. Acupuncture treatment will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner. "De qi" (an irradiating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling) is achieved if possible. An electric-stimulator (CEFAR Acus II, Lund, Sweden) is connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in continuous wave, frequency of 4 Hz, 0.45 ms square wave pulses and constant current. Surgical tape or hair pin will be adhered to the needles. The needles will be left for 30 minutes and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of 3 sessions per week for 3 consecutive weeks.</P>
<P>Minimal acupuncture: active comparator patients will be treated superficially at points away from classic acupoints. The points include bilateral "Deltoideus" (in the middle of the line insertion of Binao LI 14 and acromion), "Forearm" (1 inch laterally of the middle point between Shaohai HE3 and Shenmen HE7), "Upper arm" (1 inch laterally of Tianfu LU 3) and "Lower leg" (0.5 inch dorsally of Xuanzhong GB39). "De qi" is avoided during needling. The treatment procedure, electric-stimulation, frequency, duration and number of treatment sessions will be the same for the traditional acupuncture group.</P>
<P>Placebo acupuncture: placebo comparator needles designed by Streitberger (1998) will be used. The placebo needles are blunt needle that will not penetrate the skin during needle insertion. The handles of these placebo needles will slide over the needle when it is compressed, giving it the appearance of penetrating the skin. The placebo needles are inserted to the site 1 inch beside the acupoints in order to avoid the acupressure effect. The needles are held by a surgical tape or hair pin in hairy region to imitate the retention of needles. The needles are connected to an electric-stimulator with zero frequency and amplitude. The number, duration and frequency of the treatment sessions, and the intervention procedure will be the same for electro-acupuncture and placebo acupuncture.</P>
