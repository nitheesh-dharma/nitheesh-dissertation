<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-13 13:09:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a potentially beneficial treatment for apnea in premature babies, but more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. Recurrent spells of apnea (pause in breathing greater than 20 seconds) are almost universal in babies born before 34 weeks gestation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) delivered via small prongs inserted in the baby's nose offers breathing support and is a useful treatment for apnea. However, not all babies respond to this treatment. Some infants fail and require a breathing tube inserted into their trachea (windpipe), which has potential complications (infection, injuries to the vocal cords). This review of two small trials suggests that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) delivered via nasal prongs may be more effective than NCPAP alone in preterm babies whose apneas are frequent or severe. Further research is needed to confirm effectiveness and safety as few babies have been studied so far.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Apnea of prematurity is almost universal in infants who are born before 34 weeks gestation. Previous randomised trials and systematic reviews have found methylxanthines to be effective in preventing apnea of prematurity. However, recent concerns about potential long-term side effects of methylxanthines on the neurodevelopment of low birth weight infants have led to an increased interest in alternate methods of treating apnea of prematurity. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a useful method of respiratory support that reduces the incidence of obstructive or mixed apnea. However, apneic infants managed with NCPAP, with or without methylxanthines, sometimes require endotracheal intubation with its attendant morbidity and cost. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a simple, effective mode of respiratory support for older children and adults. It has been used to treat apnea in preterm infants but case reports of gastrointestinal perforations have limited its widespread use.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of treatment with NIPPV compared to treatment with NCPAP on apnea and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in preterm infants with recurrent apnea. To determine the effect of treatment with NIPPV compared to treatment with NCPAP on the incidence of gastrointestinal complications, i.e. gastric distension leading to cessation of feeds, or perforation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE was searched (1966-week 2 - July 2007). Other sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007) and CINAHL (1982-week 2, July 2007). Also used were expert informants, previous reviews including cross-references, and conference and symposia proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised trials were included.<BR/>Participants included unventilated preterm infants experiencing apnea of prematurity.<BR/>Interventions compared were intermittent positive pressure ventilation administered via the nasal route, either by short nasal prongs or nasopharyngeal tube, and nasal CPAP delivered by the same methods.</P>
<P>Types of outcome measures: <BR/> - failure of therapy as defined by apnea that is frequent or severe requiring additional ventilatory support<BR/> - rates of endotracheal intubation<BR/> - rates of apnea and bradycardia expressed as events per hour<BR/> - gastrointestinal complications i.e. abdominal distension requiring cessation of feeds, or GI perforation</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by the three reviewers. The trials were analysed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) for dichotomous data; means and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used for continuous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials enrolling 54 infants in total, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Both reported only the short term results (4 to 6 hours) of the interventions. Only one infant (randomised to NCPAP) required intubation during this period. In a cross-over study of 20 infants, Ryan 1989 showed no significant difference in rates of apnea (events/hr) between the two interventions [WMD -0.10 (-0.53,0.33)]. Lin (1998) randomised 34 infants and demonstrated a greater reduction in frequency of apneas (events/hr) with NIPPV compared to NCPAP [WMD -1.19 (-2.31,-0.07)]. Meta-analysis of both trials showed no difference in pC0<SUB>2</SUB> (mmHg) at the end of the 4-6 hour study period [WMD 0.95 (-3.05,4.94)]. No data were reported on gastrointestinal complications.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Implications for practice: NIPPV may be a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants with apnea that is frequent or severe. Its use appears to reduce the frequency of apneas more effectively than NCPAP. Additional safety and efficacy data are required before recommending NIPPV as standard therapy for apnea.</P>
<P>Implications for research: Future trials with sufficient power should assess the efficacy (reduction in failure of therapy) and safety (GI complications) of NIPPV. Outcomes should be assessed throughout the entire period during which the infant requires assisted ventilation. The recent ability to synchronise NIPPV with an infant's spontaneous respirations is a promising development requiring further assessment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The majority of preterm infants born before 34 weeks gestation experience apnea of prematurity in the first 10 days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1991</LINK>). Apnea in infants has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds or an apneic event less than 20 seconds associated with bradycardia and/or cyanosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1978</LINK>). Apnea may be classified as obstructive (10 - 20%), central (10 - 55%) or mixed (33 - 71%) (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruggins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruggins 1991</LINK>). Methylxanthines are effective in treating apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1999</LINK>). Recent concerns about potential long-term neurological morbidity associated with use of methylxanthines in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1999</LINK>) have renewed interest in other modalities of treatment for apnea of prematurity. NCPAP has been reported to be an effective treatment for apneas of obstructive and mixed types (small non-randomised studies), presumably by improving airway patency (<LINK REF="REF-Andr_x00e9_asson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andréasson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1985</LINK>) but no systematic review comparing NCPAP to no treatment for apnea of prematurity could be found. Some infants treated with both methylxanthines and NCPAP continue to experience troublesome apnea. NIPPV is a potentially useful therapy for such infants.</P>
<P>Adults and older children with acute or chronic ventilatory failure of various etiologies, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bott-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bott 1993</LINK>), severe kyphoscoliosis (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1988</LINK>) and pre-lung transplantation cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Piper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piper 1992</LINK>) have been treated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation delivered via a nasal interface. Improvements in hypoventilation and oxygen saturation levels have been described.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1985</LINK> reported a case series of 10 very small newborn infants with intractable apnea of prematurity who were treated with IPPV administered via nasal prongs. A survival rate of 50% was found, but there was no comparison with a control group. A more recent case series reported that 5 of 7 infants failing NCPAP because of intractable apnea were managed without intubation and mechanical ventilation using nasal IPPV with only minor side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Derleth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derleth 1992</LINK>). NIPPV in various forms was reported to be used by 53% of Canadian tertiary care nurseries in the mid 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1989</LINK>). NIPPV has been shown to reduce asynchronous thoracoabdominal motion perhaps as a result of reducing tube resistance and/or better stabilisation of the chest wall (<LINK REF="REF-Kiciman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiciman 1998</LINK>). The technique has not been without problems in neonates. <LINK REF="REF-Garland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1985</LINK> reported an association between the use of ventilation via nasal prongs and increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation. </P>
<P> Until recently, NIPPV was not synchronized with the infant's breathing. It is possible that gastrointestinal side-effects might be reduced if ventilator breaths were delivered in synchrony with laryngeal opening.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Two primary objectives were identified:</P>
<P>1. To determine the effect of treatment with NIPPV compared to treatment with NCPAP on the rate of failure of therapy (frequent or severe apneas requiring additional ventilatory support or use of endotracheal intubation) in preterm infants with recurrent apnea.<BR/>2. To determine the effect of treatment with NIPPV compared to treatment with NCPAP on GI complications i.e. gastric distension requiring cessation of feeds, or GI perforation.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned on the basis of:<BR/>- method of NIPPV delivery (nasal prongs or nasopharyngeal tube)<BR/>- methylxanthine usage<BR/>- characteristics of participants: birth weight and postmenstrual age at time of intervention, e.g. with cut-offs at 1000 g and 28 weeks</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Cochrane Neonatal Review Group search strategy.<BR/>An updated search was performed on July 30, 2007.<BR/>MEDLINE was searched (1966-week 3, July 2007) using the MeSH terms: infant, newborn (exp) and positive-pressure respiration (exp). Other sources including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), CINAHL (1982-week 3, July 2007) (search terms: infant, newborn and intermittent positive pressure ventilation), expert informants, previous reviews including cross-references and conference and symposia proceedings were used.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the trials: standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Group were used.</P>
<P>The three review authors independently assessed the quality of studies using the following criteria: blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome measurement. Data were extracted independently by the three review authors, then compared and differences resolved. Categorical data (proportion requiring intubation) were analysed using relative risk, risk difference and number needed to treat. Continuous data (frequency of apneas, C0<SUB>2</SUB> levels) were analysed using means and weighted mean difference. Additional information was sought from the authors: <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK> generously provided individual patient data from which it was possible to calculate differences in apnea rates, i.e. rate before intervention minus that after intervention. The mean and standard deviation of the difference in apnea rate was then calculated. The fixed effects model was used. The crossover trial of Ryan (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1989</LINK>) was handled in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group - i.e. the effect and variance estimators from analysis of both periods combined were used.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned, using the same methods, to determine whether responses differed according to methods of NIPPV delivery and whether or not methylxanthines were used concurrently. Subgroup analyses based on characteristics of participants were planned: birth weight (e.g. infants &lt; 1000 g) and postmenstrual age at time of intervention (e.g. infants &lt; 28 weeks).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two trials meeting the inclusion criteria of the review were identified - <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1989</LINK>.<BR/>Lin 1998 performed a randomised controlled trial that enrolled 34 premature infants (25 - 32 weeks) experiencing &gt; 2 apneas per hour for four hours. All had received aminophylline. 18 were randomised to NIPPV (non-synchronised) and 16 to NCPAP. Both methods of support were delivered via Hudson prongs. Ryan 1989 performed a randomised 2-period crossover study that enrolled 20 infants &lt; 32 weeks gestation, treated for apnea with NCPAP and aminophylline. They were considered stable. Infants were randomly assigned to either NIPPV (non-synchronised) or NCPAP for 6h, both delivered either via nasal prongs or nasopharyngeal tubes (not specified for individual infants). Infants then crossed over to the alternate therapy for a further six hours. </P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The two trials identified in this review enrolled small numbers of infants but had no major methodological limitations. Because of the nature of the interventions, it has been impossible to blind caregivers and the possibility exists that bias could have arisen through uneven use of co-interventions. Potential confounders such as methylxanthine usage have been dealt with in both trials as all infants were loaded with aminophylline prior to the intervention. </P>
<P>NIPPV is a potentially useful way of augmenting NCPAP. The relatively recent ability to synchronise ventilator breaths with the infant's own respiratory cycle has led to renewed interest in this mode of ventilatory support. For many reasons including trauma to the airway, barotrauma and infection, it appears desirable to minimise the usage and duration of endotracheal intubation of preterm infants and the results of this review suggest that NIPPV may assist in achieving this aim. </P>
<P>The question of whether NIPPV should be used for infants experiencing troublesome apnea has considerable overlap with that relating to postextubation care, given that one of the most common causes of extubation failure is recurrent apnea. Recent randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedlich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedlich 1999</LINK>) have shown that NIPPV is superior to CPAP in preventing extubation failure without major side effects (GI perforation or significant feeding intolerance leading to cessation of feeds). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>NIPPV may be a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants with apnea that is frequent or severe. Its use appears to reduce the frequency of apneas more effectively than NCPAP. Additional safety and efficacy data are required before recommending NIPPV as standard therapy for apnea.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A systematic review of NCPAP compared to no treatment for apnea of prematurity is needed. <BR/>Randomised trials of NCPAP vs. NIPPV with larger numbers of infants, observed over their entire hospital course, are necessary to answer questions of both efficacy and safety. Outcomes including total days of assisted ventilation, rates of endotracheal intubation and rates of gastrointestinal complications should be assessed. The effect of synchronising NIPPV and the use of different devices for delivery warrant further investigation.</P>
