<P>Prophylactic oxytocin at any dose used routinely after birth can reduce blood loss with fewer side effects than ergot alkaloids.</P>
<P>The third stage of labour is that period from birth of the baby until delivery of the placenta, however, complications can continue to occur once the placenta is removed. The degree of blood loss during this stage depends, among other factors, on how quickly the uterine muscle contracts and the placenta separates from the uterine wall. Postpartum haemorrhage is a major problem, particularly where there is poor nutrition and lack of access to treatment. This review of 20 trials (involving 10,806 women) found that the routine use of prophylactic oxytocin, a drug that helps the uterus contract, may reduce the amount of blood loss during the third stage of labour. Prophylactic oxytocin is better at preventing blood loss compared with ergot alkaloids, however, no further improvement is seen when they were used together. More research is needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, on the best method to implement this intervention in the third stage for women in all countries, on the dose to use, and the best route for administration (intramuscular or intravenous).</P>

<P>
<B>Prophylactic oxytocin versus placebo</B>
</P>
<P>Prophylactic oxytocin compared with placebo reduced the risk of PPH greater than 500 mL, (risk ratio (RR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.74; six trials, 4203 women; T² = 0.11, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 78%) and the need for therapeutic uterotonics (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, four trials, 3174 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.10, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 58%). The benefit of prophylactic oxytocin to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL was seen in all subgroups. Decreased use of therapeutic uterotonics was only seen in the following subgroups: randomised trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.92; three trials, 3122 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.11, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 69%); trials that performed active management of the third stage (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; one trial, 1901 women; heterogeneity not applicable); trials that delivered oxytocin as an IV bolus (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.82; one trial, 1000 women; heterogeneity not applicable); and in trials that gave oxytocin at a dose of 10 IU (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.68; two trials, 2901 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.02, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 27%).</P>

<B>Prophylactic oxytocin versus ergot alkaloids</B>
</P>
<P>Prophylactic oxytocin was superior to ergot alkaloids in preventing PPH greater than 500 mL (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.94; five trials, 2226 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.00, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 0%). The benefit of oxytocin over ergot alkaloids to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL only persisted in the subgroups of quasi-randomised trials (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; three trials, 1402 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.00, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 0%) and in trials that performed active management of the third stage of labour (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; two trials, 943 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.00, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 0%). Use of prophylactic oxytocin was associated with fewer side effects compared with use of ergot alkaloids; including decreased nausea between delivery of the baby and discharge from the labour ward (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.53; three trials, 1091 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.41, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 41%) and vomiting between delivery of the baby and discharge from the labour ward (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.25; three trials, 1091 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.45, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 30%).</P>
<P>
<B>Prophylactic oxytocin + ergometrine versus ergot alkaloids</B>
</P>
<P>There was no benefit seen in the combination of oxytocin and ergometrine versus ergometrine alone in preventing PPH greater than 500 mL (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.41; five trials, 2891 women; T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.89, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 80%). The use of oxytocin and ergometrine was associated with increased mean blood loss (MD 61.0 mL; 95% CI 6.00 to 116.00 mL; fixed-effect analysis; one trial, 34 women; heterogeneity not applicable).</P>
<P>In all three comparisons, there was no difference in mean length of the third stage or need for manual removal of the placenta between treatment arms.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-14 16:29:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic oxytocin at any dose decreases both PPH greater than 500 mL and the need for therapeutic uterotonics compared to placebo alone. Taking into account the subgroup analyses from both primary outcomes, to achieve maximal benefit providers may opt to implement a practice of giving prophylactic oxytocin as part of the active management of the third stage of labour at a dose of 10 IU given as an IV bolus. If IV delivery is not possible, IM delivery may be used as this route of delivery did show a benefit to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL and there was a trend to decrease the need for therapeutic uterotonics, albeit not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Prophylactic oxytocin was superior to ergot alkaloids in preventing PPH greater than 500 mL; however, in subgroup analysis this benefit did not persist when only randomised trials with low risk of methodologic bias were analysed. Based on this, there is limited high-quality evidence supporting a benefit of prophylactic oxytocin over ergot alkaloids. However, the use of prophylactic oxytocin was associated with fewer side effects, specifically nausea and vomiting, making oxytocin the more desirable option for routine use to prevent PPH.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of benefit when adding oxytocin to ergometrine compared to ergot alkaloids alone, and there may even be increased harm as one study showed evidence that using the combination was associated with increased mean blood loss compared to ergot alkaloids alone.</P>
<P>Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that prophylactic oxytocin increases the risk of retained placenta when compared to placebo or ergot alkaloids.</P>
<P>More placebo-controlled, randomised, and double-blinded trials are needed to improve the quality of data used to evaluate the effective dose, timing, and route of administration of prophylactic oxytocin to prevent PPH. In addition, more trials are needed especially, but not only, in low- and middle-income countries to evaluate these interventions in the birth centres that shoulder the majority of the burden of PPH in order to improve maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-29 12:14:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-14 16:39:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most reliable estimates of global maternal mortality report between 250,000 and 300,000 deaths from childbirth annually (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2011</LINK>). The majority of these deaths are due to complications of the third stage of labour, and most commonly are from postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (<LINK REF="REF-AbouZahr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AbouZahr 2003</LINK>). Nearly all maternal deaths (99%) occur in the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Kwast-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwast 1991</LINK>), where other factors, such as infection (especially HIV infection), poor nutritional status, and lack of easy access to treatment, may contribute to death in the presence of severe PPH. Many more women survive and suffer serious illness as a result, not only from the effects of acute anaemia but also from the interventions which a severe haemorrhage may necessitate (such as general anaesthesia, manual removal of the placenta, blood transfusion, and hysterectomy).</P>
<P>The degree of blood loss associated with placental separation and delivery depends on how quickly the placenta separates from the uterine wall and how effectively the uterine muscle contracts around the placental bed (where the placenta is attached to the wall of the uterus) and the uterine blood vessels, in addition to how quickly the uterus expels the placenta through the birth canal. Techniques to prevent PPH can target any of these points in placental delivery. A recent review determined that active management of the third stage of labour prevents severe PPH, defined as 1000 mL, when compared to expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>). Active management includes administration of a uterotonic, early cord clamping, and controlled cord traction until delivery of the placenta.</P>
<P>Uterotonic drugs increase the tone of the uterine muscles and were initially introduced for the treatment of PPH. <LINK REF="REF-Moir-1932" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moir 1932</LINK> showed that ergometrine was the active principle on which the known uterotonic effect of ergot had depended. Reviewing its use in obstetric practice by the early 1950s, his opinion was that "Few drugs have become so firmly established in so short a time and few drugs can be so completely indispensable as ergometrine is now" (<LINK REF="REF-Moir-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moir 1955</LINK>). Ergometrine (ergonovine in the United States) became popular for routine management in the early 1950s. Oxytocin is a naturally occurring uterotonic, which Du Vigneaud et al synthesised and reported in 1953 (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Vigneaud-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Vigneaud 1953</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Embrey-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embrey 1963</LINK> reported advantages of combining this with ergometrine (as Syntometrine - oxytocin five international units (IU) plus ergometrine 0.5 mg). In order to prevent blood loss, these uterotonics and, more recently, prostaglandins are also being used for prophylactic third-stage management. One commonly given uterotonic is oxytocin, and recently it was shown that there was no difference in preventing PPH if you administer the oxytocin with the anterior shoulder or after delivery of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>While few would dispute the contribution of uterotonic drugs in the treatment of PPH, their role in routine prophylaxis is less clear. This review considers the prophylactic role of one of these uterotonics, oxytocin, in the third stage of labour. Other relevant published reviews are by <LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>, which compares active with expectant third-stage management (where active management involves the package of interconnected interventions of prophylactic uterotonics, early cutting and clamping of the umbilical cord, and controlled cord traction); <LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunçalp 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>, which both consider the role of different prophylactic uterotonics (prostaglandins, and ergometrine-oxytocin compared with oxytocin, respectively) in third-stage management; and <LINK REF="REF-Carroli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 2001</LINK>, which looks at the role of umbilical vein injection for the treatment of retained placenta. Subsequent third-stage management reviews will consider the role of prophylactic uterotonics more generally, and of prophylactic ergot alkaloids in particular. As these interventions are very inter-related, some aspects of the role of oxytocin may be found in these other reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunçalp 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Any research related to PPH must also recognise the limitations of the data collected due to the lack of a formal definition of PPH and an easy, objective technique to accurately measure blood loss after delivery. For example, although PPH is generally defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL, alternative cut-off points of 600 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Beischer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beischer 1986</LINK>) and 1000 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Burchell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burchell 1980</LINK>) have been suggested. It has long been recognised that such clinical estimation is likely to underestimate the actual volume of blood lost by 34% to 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Newton-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Newton 1961</LINK>a) and as a result, there is significant variability in the estimated incidence of PPH, from 5% to 18% in one country (<LINK REF="REF-AbouZahr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AbouZahr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DoH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1988a</LINK>). Using the outcome of measured blood loss, therefore, has significant limitations and potential for bias. Due to the fact that blood measurement is so variable, more objective measures, such as the need for therapeutic uterotonics, should also be evaluated as a primary outcome to minimise measurement bias related to estimating PPH from blood loss.</P>

The role of prophylactic prostaglandins or ergot alkaloids and uterotonics given through the umbilical vein, for the treatment of blood loss or retained placenta, will be the subject of other reviews and were not included here (<LINK REF="REF-Liabsuetrakul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabsuetrakul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunçalp 2012</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>In trials evaluating different interventions in the third stage of labour, PPH is often the primary outcome. Assessment of PPH is prone to bias if the staff making the assessments are not blind to the intervention. In this review, all outcome assessments were blinded in five trials. Because of the inherent bias in the remaining 15 trials that either had no blinding or unclear description of the blinding process, we changed the primary outcomes to include the use of therapeutic uterotonics, which do not rely on the measurement of blood loss.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-10-29 12:01:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review compares the use of prophylactic oxytocin at any dose given during the third stage of labour to placebo and ergot alkaloids. Overall, the data show a benefit of using prophylactic oxytocin compared with placebo to reduce postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) greater than 500 mL and to reduce the need for therapeutic uterotonics. Given that this analysis included trials with unclear or high-risk random sequence generation and allocation concealment, a subgroup analysis of only randomised trials with low risk of methodologic was performed. After analysing only these low-risk of bias randomised trials, the benefit in preventing PPH greater than 500 mL remains statistically significant and of a similar magnitude of all trials (all trials risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.74; low-risk randomised trials only RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77). The benefit of oxytocin to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL was seen regardless of the management of the third stage of labour, the route of delivery, or the dose of oxytocin given. This data strongly support the use of prophylactic oxytocin over placebo during the third stage of labour to minimise PPH greater than 500 mL.</P>
<P>The majority of the trials included in this analysis were not blinded and therefore increased the risk of bias when using the subjective outcome of measured blood loss. As a result, we modified the primary outcomes to include the need for therapeutic uterotonics, which do not rely on absolute blood loss measurements but may more objectively reflect severe blood loss. Prophylactic oxytocin versus placebo also decreased the need for therapeutic uterotonics, further supporting the clinical benefit of using prophylactic oxytocin during the third stage of labour to prevent PPH. This benefit persisted when only randomised trials with low risk of methodologic bias were analysed (all trials RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low-risk trials RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.92). Based on the subgroups analysed, the benefit of prophylactic oxytocin to decrease the need for therapeutic uterotonics is seen only in trials where oxytocin is given as part of the active management of the third stage of labour and at a dose of 10 IU delivered as an IV bolus. This suggests that the maximum benefit of oxytocin may be seen when used as one component of active management of the third stage and that simply administering oxytocin alone may not be adequate to prevent PPH. Further studies on the specific aspects of active management of the third stage of labour are needed to help answer the question of what component of active management provides the most benefit. Regarding the delivery of oxytocin, our subgroup analysis shows a benefit of decreasing the use of therapeutic uterotonics only when oxytocin is given as an IV bolus. If IV delivery is not possible, IM delivery may be used as this route of delivery did show a benefit to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL and there was a trend to decrease the use of therapeutic uterotonics, albeit not statistically significant. When looking at the analysis of the IM subgroup in more detail, there are two small trials that used IM oxytocin and showed no benefit and one large trial that did show a benefit when giving oxytocin IM. The larger trial, <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010</LINK>, had a more rigorous study design than the others included in this analysis and did show a benefit of IM oxytocin to prevent the need for therapeutic uterotonics. If only the <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010</LINK> was included in the subgroup analysis, IM delivery would also have significantly decreased the need for therapeutic uterotonics, so it is likely that either IV or IM delivery of oxytocin provides clinical benefit.</P>
<P>Importantly, using prophylactic oxytocin in the third stage of labour did not increase the need for manual removal of the placenta when compared to placebo. Using prophylactic oxytocin in the third stage of labour offers a significant benefit of preventing PPH and the need for therapeutic uterotonics without increasing risks of adverse events.</P>
<P>After inclusion of data from five new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jago-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jago 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moodie-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moodie 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orji-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Orji 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saito-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saito 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaughan-Williams1974" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughan Williams1974</LINK>), a new finding of this review is that prophylactic oxytocin is more efficacious in preventing PPH greater than 500 mL than ergot alkaloids. This benefit is not statistically significant when only the low-risk randomised trials are analysed separately (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.15, random-effects, T²<SUP> </SUP>= 0.0, I²<SUP> </SUP>= 0%). Of the nine trials included in this analysis, only three had adequate random sequence generation and only four had adequate allocation concealment, suggesting significant risk of bias in the analysis of all trials. The more accurate analysis is that of only trials with low methodologic bias, as a result, there is no high-quality evidence to suggest a significant benefit from using prophylactic oxytocin versus ergot alkaloids to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL. There is a trend towards a benefit of prophylactic oxytocin compared to ergot alkaloids to decrease the need for therapeutic uterotonics, but this was not statistically significant. However, even though there is not strong evidence supporting the use of prophylactic oxytocin over ergot alkaloids to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL or the need for therapeutic uterotonics, there is also no evidence that ergot alkaloids are better to prevent PPH. In addition, prophylactic oxytocin is associated with fewer side effects, making the routine use of prophylactic oxytocin the preferred uterotonic to prevent PPH compared with ergot alkaloids.</P>
<P>At this time, there is little evidence to support any additive benefit when using oxytocin plus ergometrine, and there is some limited evidence from this review that the combination may increase mean blood loss when compared to ergot alkaloids alone. The trials used for this analysis have high risk of methodologic bias and as a result, there are very limited data to rigorously analyse these two treatment groups for a clinical benefit.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-14 16:43:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Before making major changes to practice based on the current review, further information from other reviews considering the role of active management (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>), the timing of delivery of oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2010</LINK>), of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunçalp 2012</LINK>), and of ergot alkaloids (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>) needs to be taken into account.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, given the benefit of prophylactic oxytocin in terms of reducing postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) and the need for therapeutic uterotonics when compared to using no uterotonic, there appears to be a strong evidence in favour of using prophylactic oxytocin. Taking into account the data from both primary outcomes, in order to achieve maximal benefit providers may opt to implement a practice of giving prophylactic oxytocin as part of the active management of the third stage of labour at a dose of 10 IU given as an intravenous (IV) bolus. If IV delivery is not possible, intramuscular (IM) delivery may be used as this route of delivery did show a benefit to prevent PPH greater than 500 mL and there was a trend to decrease the use of therapeutic uterotonics, albeit not statistically significant. In addition, the use of prophylactic oxytocin does not increase the risk of adverse events, specifically the need for manual removal of the placenta. This has to be tempered, however, by the knowledge that a number of the trials included have unclear or high risk of study bias and that the translation of this data to all international birth centres is limited due to the majority of studies taking place in developed countries.</P>
<P>Similarly, the balance of evidence does not support the prophylactic use of ergot alkaloids alone (when compared to either oxytocin alone, or to ergometrine-oxytocin). In addition, the use of prophylactic oxytocin decreases the risk of maternal side effects, specifically nausea and vomiting, when compared to ergot alkaloids, making oxytocin the preferred option for routine management of the third stage of labour.</P>
<P>There is no benefit seen when using a combination of oxytocin and ergometrine versus ergot alkaloids alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-14 16:43:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Birth centres in low- and middle-income countries shoulder the burden of most of the complications arising from the management of the third stage of labour, and there needs to be more studies in these countries to increase the translatability of these data to these high-risk centres. In order to improve outcomes worldwide, especially where routine management of the third stage is expectant, there needs to be better evidence on which components of the active management of the third stage of labour contribute to prevention of PPH. A definition of PPH is urgently needed with use of an objective measure and not the subjective evaluation by providers of what constitutes PPH. The optimal dosing of oxytocin and route of administration need to be determined in addition to dispelling concerns of potential side effects. Delivery systems for oxytocin need to be studied, especially in developing countries, such as the use of BD-Uniject&#8482; Prefillable Injection System (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to deliver prophylactic oxytocin. Another aspect of the management of the third stage may affect the amount of blood lost is delayed cord clamping of the neonate. There is not sufficient evidence on the use of immediate/early or delayed cord clamping in order to improve neonatal outcomes. There is a need for a definition of what is delayed cord clamping, on whether it is clinically useful, and if so, at what gestational age. The lack of uniformity in clinical studies of the management of the third stage questions the strength of existing evidence, specifically in the lack of standard definitions of various procedures (i.e. active management) and outcomes (i.e. PPH). It also makes it very difficult for training of healthcare personnel and for scaling up of these procedures and interventions worldwide.</P>
<P>Once there is a consensus on the effective components of the active management of the third stage of labour, there is a need to conduct clinical studies to determine why active management of the third stage is not utilised consistently.</P>
<P>These trials should study outcomes which are of relevance to the majority of postpartum women such as fatigue, the ability to care for their babies, and those more rare but serious complications associated with severe morbidity, such as renal failure, transfusion of blood products, coagulopathy, intrauterine infections, hysterectomy, and the worst outcome, mortality.</P>

<P>In order to reduce subjectivity in our primary analysis, we have added the use of therapeutic uterotonics as a primary outcome and have moved severe postpartum haemorrhage to a secondary outcome. The use of therapeutic uterotonics is an outcome that is dichotomous and does not rely on the highly subjective techniques that are used to measure total blood loss and may more objectively reflect severe blood loss. We feel that by making this change, we have increased the strength of the observations made by this review.</P>
<P>In addition, we have added an additional subgroup analysis based on the dose of oxytocin. We feel that this analysis may help to answer an important clinical question regarding the dose of prophylactic oxytocin that is the most beneficial in order to improve the translatability of this analysis into clinical practice. Subgroup analysis based on the timing of the oxytocin has been removed.</P>
<P>Given that included trials did not report on neonatal data and the effect on neonatal outcomes was not an objective of this study, these secondary outcomes were removed.</P>
<P>For the 2013 update, our threshold for 'substantial' heterogeneity was increased from I² greater than 30% to greater than 40%.</P>

<P>It is important to take care that the conclusions are based on pre-specified objectives, as sometimes the study is done and then the objectives decided afterwards.</P>
<P>In this review, there is no discussion of the way different studies determined blood loss, and the limitations of these methods. This is especially true for <LINK REF="STD-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pierre 1992</LINK>. Also, the results should take into account Hoffman 2004, comparing oxytocin with expectant management. In this study, although the mean change in hematocrit was significantly less in the oxytocin group, there was no difference in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage.</P>

<P>6 July 2011</P>
<P>We agree that there are a lot of limitations to this review, specifically that in the studies included there are differences in the method of delivery of pitocin, definition of the active management of the third stage, and determining accurate blood loss after delivery. However, this review incorporates the only randomised controlled trials that attempt to address this important topic. We agree that a formalized method for determining blood loss is needed as that will further advance our ability to perform useful research in this field.</P>
<P>Please see our conclusion section for a more thorough discussion of these topics.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-16 13:50:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first publication, two review authors checked the titles and abstracts identified from the search. Two of the review authors obtained the full text of all studies of possible relevance for independent assessment. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with particular concentration on allocation concealment, ranked using the Cochrane approach of adequate, uncertain or inadequate. Two review authors performed the data extraction. Trial authors were contacted for clarification where relevant. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.</P>
<P>For this update the following methods were used.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed for inclusion all potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assign a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation; such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation, such as open list of random number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assess blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Attrition bias (loss of participants, e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assess completeness to follow-up using the following criteria:</P>
<P>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) more than 10% and less than 20% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>

<P>We planned for all three review authors to extract the data and to resolve discrepancies through discussion. We planned to use the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double-enter the data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We planned to carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) and would have used a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data if trials were sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data: we planned to present results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>For continuous data: we planned to use the weighted mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We planned to use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods. If there was evidence of skewness this would have been reported.</P>
<P>We planned to analyse data on an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, all participants with available data would have been included in the analysis in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we would have attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Tests of heterogeneity between trials would have been applied if appropriate using the I² statistic. If we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials, (exceeding 50%), we would have explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and have performed sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis would have been used as an overall summary if considered appropriate.</P>
<P>Three comparisons would have been considered:<BR/>(a) oxytocin versus no uterotonics;<BR/>(b) oxytocin versus ergot alkaloids;<BR/>(c) oxytocin plus ergometrine versus ergot alkaloids.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned based on extent of control for selection bias, on whether the oxytocin is administered within the context of active or expectant management of the third stage of labour, and on the timing of administration. Further subgroup analyses may consider the effects of different doses or different routes of administration if appropriate data become available.</P>
<P>Results are presented as relative risk ratios for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals using a fixed-effect model. If sufficient heterogeneity existed, sensitivity analyses would have be performed.</P>
