<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-18 13:50:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Diabetes is a condition in which glucose (sugar) in the blood is too high because the body does not respond to insulin or not enough insulin is made. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, which allows glucose to enter the cells where it is used as fuel by the body.</P>
<P>Controlling blood sugar levels is important because levels that are too high or too low can affect the brain and other organs of the body. Poor blood sugar control in pregnant women with diabetes can lead to large babies who may then have a difficult birth. It also increases the chance of abnormalities in the baby, miscarriage, or stillbirth.</P>
<P>Traditionally, insulin is given as multiple daily injections (MDI), however a small pump can continuously give insulin through a fine tube under the skin (CSII).</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>An insulin pump may help pregnant women keep their blood glucose more stable than multiple injections. It might stop the woman's blood sugar level going too high or too low, which would be better for the mother and her baby and it may be more acceptable to women. This review compared the positive and negative effects of CSII and MDI to work out which is best for mothers and infants.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>Five randomised trials involving 153 women (154 pregnancies) were included.</P>
<P>These trials did not report many of the outcomes we had hoped to look at. The evidence was judged to be very low quality for important outcomes (caesarean section, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, and neonatal hypoglycaemia). This was because the trials were small, may not have been fair tests, and did not show a clear difference between MDI and CSII.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences in any of the reported outcomes between women who had insulin via a pump rather than as multiple injections. For mothers, this included caesarean section, weight gain during pregnancy, and blood sugar levels. For babies, this included the baby's weight, if they were born premature, and problems such as difficulty breathing, a low Apgar score at birth, low blood sugar, jaundice, or physical abnormalities.</P>
<P>In one small trial, there was no difference in the number of days mothers spent in hospital. This was the only measure of cost or use of health service resources reported.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>The trials did not provide enough information to know whether an insulin pump or multiple injections are better for a pregnant woman with diabetes or her baby. More research is needed, with bigger groups of women, good reporting of how the trials were undertaken, more outcomes assessed and reported, and using the latest pump technology and insulins.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-16 09:13:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetes results in a rise in blood glucose above normal physiological levels; if untreated this may cause damage to many systems including the cardiovascular and renal systems. Pregnancy increases resistance to insulin action; for those women who have pre-gestational diabetes, this results in an increasing insulin requirement. There are several methods of administering insulin. Conventionally, insulin has been administered subcutaneously, formally referred to as intensive conventional treatment, but now more usually referred to as multiple daily injections (MDI). An alternative method of insulin administration is the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-06 15:15:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five single-centre trials (undertaken in Italy) with 153 women and 154 pregnancies in this review.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences in the primary outcomes reported between CSII and MDI in the included trials: <B>caesarean section</B> (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.77; three trials, 71 women, <I>evidence graded very low</I>), <B>large-for-gestational age</B> (RR 4.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 34.95; three trials, 73 infants; <I>evidence graded very low</I>), and <B>perinatal mortality</B> (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 14.32; four trials, 83 infants, <I>evidence graded very low</I>). Other primary outcomes were not reported in these trials (<B>hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,</B> <B>development of type 2 diabetes, composite outcome of serious neonatal outcomes</B>, and <B>neurosensory disability</B>).</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of differences in the maternal secondary outcomes: <B>maternal weight gain during pregnancy</B>, <B>24 hour mean blood glucose</B> in each trimester, <B>mean maternal HbA1c</B> in each trimester, <B>maternal hypoglycaemia</B>, and <B>maternal hyperglycaemia</B>. The included studies did not report several GRADE outcomes: <B>perineal trauma</B>, <B>return to pre-pregnancy weight</B>, <B>postnatal depression</B>, <B>induction of labour.</B> Many maternal secondary outcomes were also not reported.</P>
<P>In two trials, including a total of 61 infants, CSII was associated with an increase in <B>mean birthweight </B>compared with MDI (mean difference (MD) 220.56 g, 95% CI -2.09 g to 443.20 g; P = 0.05). However, the large CI including anything from a small reduction to an increase in mean birthweight and the lack of a difference in <B>macrosomia</B> rate (RR 3.20, CI 0.14 to 72.62; two trials, 61 infants) suggests uncertainty. <B>Large-for-gestational age</B> (see above), and<B> small-for-gestational age</B> also suggests uncertainty of effect. No significant differences were found in: <B>gestation at delivery</B>, <B>preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks' gestation</B>, <B>preterm birth &lt; 32 weeks' gestation</B>, <B>neonatal hypoglycaemia</B> (<I>evidence graded very low), </I>
<B>respiratory distress syndrome</B>, <B>neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia</B>, and <B>fetal anomaly</B>. There were no data reported on many important infant outcomes, including the GRADE outcomes <B>adiposity </B>and <B>diabetes.</B> There was no follow-up of infants in childhood or adulthood, so longer-term outcomes were not reported.</P>
<P>The only outcome reported for use of health service resources was<B> maternal days hospitalised, </B>which did not show a difference between groups in the small number of women included (MD 9.40, CI -6.04 to 24.84; one trial, 10 women). </P>
<P>The methods used by the trials were poorly reported, for example although blinding of participants and clinicians regarding intervention allocation is impossible, it is possible to blind assessors and this along with other aspects of trial methods was not reported, which means that the trials are at an unclear or high risk of bias. We do not know if the women who participated were representative, and therefore if the results can be generalised. Most GRADE outcomes were not reported. For the GRADE outcomes that were reported, our assessment was that the evidence is <I>very low quality</I> (<B>caesarean section, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, </B>and<B> neonatal hypoglycaemia</B>). This was due to design limitations in the included trials, small sample sizes in the trials contributing data, wide CIs crossing both the line of no effect and the line of appreciable benefit and/or harm, and often few events. We are therefore uncertain whether CSII or MDI improves outcomes for pregnant women with diabetes and their infants, and the results of further studies may differ substantially from those presented in this review.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-05-05 09:57:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. There are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population.</P>
<P>Pump technology has progressed since these trials were undertaken. Well-designed randomised trials are required to evaluate comparisons such as patch pumps against MDI and more conventional CSII against MDI. These trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of interventions, and report the core set of outcomes used in Cochrane reviews of diabetes in pregnancy. Trials to assess the effects of pumps on birthweight and macrosomia rates are needed. It would be beneficial for future trials to undertake longer-term follow-up of participants and their infants, assess women's preferences, and conduct an economic evaluation.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-06 14:53:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetes is a major disease affecting a growing proportion of pregnant women. Diabetes occurs when there is insufficient insulin in the blood. Given that insulin controls blood glucose levels, inadequate circulating insulin levels lead to a rise in blood glucose. Increased blood glucose levels can cause damage to many systems, including the cardiovascular and renal systems and during pregnancy, are associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. There are two main types of diabetes that exist prior to pregnancy: type 1 diabetes occurs due to a lack of pancreatic islet b cells, caused by autoimmune destruction and resulting in an absence of insulin; type 2 diabetes occurs due to insulin resistance or b cell dysfunction, or both, and is likely to be the result of interactions between genetic, environmental and immunological factors; including diet, physical activity and obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Zaccardi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaccardi 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physiological insulin resistance increases during pregnancy to facilitate glucose transfer across the placenta to the fetus, to ensure growth and development. This physiological insulin resistance leads to increasing Insulin requirements for women who have pre-gestational diabetes and who manage their diabetes with insulin; for those who manage their diabetes with diet and/or oral anti-diabetic agents, insulin may be required and for some women without pre-existing diabetes, gestational diabetes may develop. Recent studies have reported graded linear associations between maternal glucose and adverse perinatal outcomes across the whole glucose spectrum, with no clear threshold where risk increases (<LINK REF="REF-HAPO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">HAPO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2015</LINK>), therefore interventions to reduce glucose levels for women with lower glucose levels, than were previously diagnostic of gestational diabetes, are likely to reduce associated perinatal risks. Similarly to maternal glucose, maternal obesity, which is a common 'co-condition' with type 2 diabetes, has been identified as being independently associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, however when maternal obesity is combined with hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) the adverse impact on perinatal outcomes is greater than either one alone (<LINK REF="REF-HAPO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">HAPO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Catalano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalano 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the introduction of insulin as a treatment for diabetes, maternal mortality and morbidity rates have improved; however, they remain significantly higher than those of the general obstetric population (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2014</LINK>). Perinatal mortality rates amongst babies of women with pre-existing diabetes have also declined over recent years, however population-based studies suggest that rates are still 2.5 to nine times higher than in the general obstetric population (<LINK REF="REF-Melamed-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melamed 2009</LINK>). In 2010 CEMACE reported that 27% of mothers with recorded pre-existing medical conditions had a stillbirth and that 3% of these had diabetes. Twenty-eight per cent of mothers whose infants died in the neonatal period also had a pre-existing medical condition and 2% of these had diabetes, making diabetes one of the commonest conditions associated with stillbirth and neonatal death (<LINK REF="REF-CMACE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMACE 2010</LINK>). Complications associated with pre-existing diabetes include: higher rates of miscarriage, stillbirth and congenital anomaly. Recent congenital anomaly rates reported for infants of women with diabetes range from 42 to 94 per 1000 births, compared to a rate of between 10 and 21 per 1000 births in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penney 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CEMACH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEMACH 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A potential problem in the assessment of the management of diabetes has been reported by <LINK REF="REF-John-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilpatrick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilpatrick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilpatrick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilpatrick 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>, who suggest that differences have been found in the ranges and results produced by laboratories using the same methods of assessment to measure the same glycaemic index. Thus, a degree of caution should be used when interpreting multi-centre studies using several laboratories to analyse specimens.</P>
<P>Continuous glucose monitoring systems are used selectively and provide a dynamic picture of interstitial glucose levels, converting these levels to an electrical signal, which produces an average recording of glucose level every five minutes. Studies using the continuous glucose monitoring system in conjunction with other methods of assessment such as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and intermittent glucose monitoring, have found it useful in providing additional information in relation to hypo/hyperglycaemia, which is of particular importance during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Buhling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhling 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerssen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerssen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2005</LINK>). The addition of continuous glucose monitoring should provide a more accurate picture of control over a 24-hour period and reduce the impact of anomalies associated with HbA1c monitoring, leading to improved glucose control.</P>
<P>Many women manage their type 2 diabetes with oral anti-diabetic agents such as metformin. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and is not associated with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). During pregnancy, the use of oral anti-diabetic agents may be supplemented or substituted with insulin in order to achieve optimum glucose control. There is limited evidence evaluating the effects of oral anti-diabetic agents on maternal and infant outcomes. Results from the metformin in gestational diabetes (MIG) trial however reported no increase in perinatal complications with metformin compared with insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Rowan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowan 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane protocol has recently been published which aims to examine oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2015</LINK>). A Cochrane review investigating the use of oral anti-diabetic agents for women with pre-existing diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes however was unable to include any trials, though one trial is ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Tieu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tieu 2010</LINK>). The current Cochrane review evaluating treatments for gestational diabetes (which has now been divided into types of treatments, with protocols being published: <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2016</LINK>) reported that treatment of gestational diabetes reduces the risk of a range of perinatal adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Alwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwan 2009</LINK> found that women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when treated with oral hypoglycaemics compared with insulin were significantly less likely to have a caesarean section and their infants significantly less likely to develop neonatal hypoglycaemia; there were however, no differences in other important outcomes including induction of labour and shoulder dystocia (difficulty in delivering a baby's shoulders).</P>
<P>There remains controversy regarding the degree to which blood glucose level should be controlled in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Though it is generally agreed that the optimal HbA1c level (retrospective glucose measure) should be between 4 mmol/L and 8 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>), though this may be difficult to achieve for women with refractory pre-existing or gestational diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Maresh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maresh 2001</LINK>). A Cochrane review has examined different intensities of glycaemic control for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2016</LINK>). This review includes three trials (223 women with type 1 diabetes and their infants) and concluded that although evidence is limited and the included trials were assessed as being at high risk of bias, there is little difference in outcomes between very tight and tight-to-moderate glycaemic control. There is however evidence of harm with loose control. A recently published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Martis-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martis 2016</LINK>) has examined trials evaluating different intensities of glycaemic control for women with gestational diabetes. The one eligible trial was published as a conference abstract, includes 171 women, methods were unclear and outcomes reported were few, therefore evidence is insufficient to suggest what intensity of glyaemic control is superior.</P>

<P>There are several methods of administering insulin to women who require it in pregnancy. Conventionally, insulin has been administered subcutaneously in the form of a basal/bolus regimen, often referred to as multiple daily injections (MDI). This consists of pre-meal boluses of rapid-acting insulin (RAI) and a later evening basal injection of long-acting insulin, usually given with pen injection devices. The advantage of MDI is that blood sugar levels can be tightly controlled by frequent, self-regulated adjustment of dose, necessary because of the dynamic insulin requirements of pregnancy, but frequent injections can be painful and may interfere with daily living activities. An alternative insulin administration method is the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII). Modern pumps are small and lightweight, are battery operated and hold enough insulin for several days (<LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2016</LINK>). A more recent advance is the development of the patch pump (tubing-free pumps in which the reservoir and integrated infusion set adhere to the skin) (<LINK REF="REF-Thabit-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thabit 2012</LINK>). Different basal rates can be preset and boluses given as required. Potentially CSII maintains the basal rate of insulin and reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia, decreases the risk of fasting hyperglycaemia (the dawn phenomenon) and can improve compliance, as frequent injection of insulin is not required (as with MDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Hadden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadden 1996</LINK>, however, suggests that although insulin pumps offer the treatment effects of conventional regimens (and may be preferred by some women), they may be overly complex for routine use. Selective use of pumps for those who are motivated, or with refractory diabetes is an alternative to widespread use.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-05-18 13:52:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Despite widespread use of CSII pumps in some high-income countries such as Norway, Germany, France and the USA, they are used infrequently in the other high-income countries such as the UK and Spain and most low- to middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2016</LINK>). Reasons for this are unclear, but may be due to conservatism, costs and lack of evidence on effectiveness and safety (<LINK REF="REF-Colquitt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colquitt 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Brink-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brink 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Knight-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Mecklenburg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecklenburg 1984</LINK> report improved glycaemic control with CSII compared to MDI, however both <LINK REF="REF-Knight-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Mecklenburg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecklenburg 1984</LINK>, also report an increased incidence of ketoacidosis. Group allocation was not random in the <LINK REF="REF-Knight-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1985</LINK> study and generally ketoacidosis was precipitated by illness. <LINK REF="REF-Brink-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brink 1986</LINK> found no increased incidence in diabetic ketoacidosis using CSII compared to MDI. Both studies (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brink-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brink 1986</LINK>) report the incidence of ketoacidosis reduced with time, suggesting learning or familiarity played a part. A recent review and meta-analyses comparing CSII compared with MDI reported that more women in the CSII group had hypoglycaemic spells and ketoacidotic episodes (requiring treatment), however the differences for both these outcomes were non-significant (<LINK REF="REF-Mukhopadhyay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhopadhyay 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both rapid-acting insulin analogues (RAIA) and regular human insulin can be given via CSII and MDI. RAIAs provide a more physiological time course of action. It has been suggested by some authors that the use of RAIAs, compared to regular human insulin, reduces episodes of hypoglycaemia and improves metabolic control (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2000</LINK>). This improved control is thought to be due to RAIAs' ability to achieve peak plasma concentrations approximately twice as high and in approximately half the time compared to regular insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>). A Cochrane review of RAIA versus regular human insulin in patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2006</LINK>) however, concluded (and taking into account the low quality of trials included in the meta-analysis), that there seemed to be only a negligible benefit with RAIA over regular human insulin. The authors suggest a cautious response to the vigorous promotion of RAIAs and that more robust trials needed to be carried with longer-term follow-up of both mother and child.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:44:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetes affects a significant and growing proportion of women in pregnancy. Hyperglycaemia is associated with increased risk of important perinatal outcomes across the whole spectrum of glucose. Treatments to reduce glucose levels however, in both women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes reduce adverse outcome risk. Different methods of administering insulin may have different effects in terms of achieving optimal glucose control and may influence the risk of maternal and infant outcomes. This review will examine the effects of CSII and MDI for women with diabetes in pregnancy.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>No cluster-randomised trials were included in this update.

We will adjust their standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population.

If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information.

<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either a Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary would have been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. If we had used random-effects analyses, the results would have been presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

Recruitment was undertaken in the first trimester, two women allocated to CSII had been using a CSII pump pre-conceptually. For women randomised to CSII, a Microject MC 20 portable syringe pump was used with porcine insulin (Actrapid MC 40 U/ml); adjustments were made to the dosage in order to obtain strict glycaemic control (fasting blood glucose (BG) &lt; 80 + 10 mg/dL, postprandial BG &lt; 120 mg/dL). Participants randomised to MDI, were given Actrapid MC split into four boluses. Outcomes were: maternal and neonatal mortality, large-for-gestational age, fetal anomaly and hypoglycaemia, weight gain during pregnancy, mean 24-hour BG, mean HbA1c, gestational age at delivery, preterm birth, birthweight and rate of instrumental delivery.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-26 12:45:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Conventionally, insulin has been administered subcutaneously in the form of a basal/bolus regimen, known as multiple daily injections (MDI). This method consists of pre-meal boluses of short-acting insulin and a later evening basal injection of long-acting insulin, usually given with pen injection devices. An alternative insulin administration method is the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII). Modern pumps are small and lightweight, different basal rates can be preset and boluses given as required and a recent advance is the development of the tubing-free pump in which the reservoir and integrated infusion set adhere to the skin (patch pump). Potentially, CSII may reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and ensure a more consistent blood glucose level, leading to a reduction in risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, however CSII was associated with a greater mean birthweight in the two trials reporting this outcome and although there was no significant difference in risk of macrosomia in one small trial, the point estimate suggests MDI may convey greater benefit.</P>
<P>At present, the insulin administration method used by most women is driven by their own and their medical teams' preferences and with what is available in a particular area of the country, rather than evidence of effectiveness. Given that funding for pump therapy may come from a variety of sources: personal, hospital or community, funding influences availability of CSII pumps for many women. Disappointingly none of the trials assessed the economic implications of CSII versus MDI use and only one reported any measure of health service resource use, therefore this is an area that requires investigation in the future.</P>
<P>Because theoretically CSII should result in less fluctuation in glucose level, some women may be offered CSII pumps as an alternative to MDI, particularly if their diabetes is difficult to control. The majority of women in many countries have no choice in how they administer insulin however, and this may be due to the lack of good quality evidence indicating superiority of one method of insulin administration over another. Large high-quality trials are therefore needed that evaluate the important outcomes indicated in this review, particularly the unexpected finding of increased mean birthweight with CSII use compared to MDI. The population included in future trials should include women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as well as pre-existing diabetes, those recruited should as far as possible reflect the general obstetric population of women with diabetes (rather than just motivated women or women with difficult to treat diabetes) and reporting of methods and findings should be comprehensive and transparent. As all the trials were single-centre and undertaken in Italy, generalisability of findings to other populations may be inappropriate, therefore multi-centre trials or trials in centres with multi-ethnic populations would be helpful.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-18 14:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review identified five small trials, with 153 women and 154 pregnancies. There were no clear differences found in any of the primary outcomes reported between CSII and MDI in the included trials: caesarean section, large-for-gestational age, and perinatal mortality. There were also no clear differences for the following secondary outcomes reported: maternal weight gain during pregnancy, maternal 24-hour mean blood glucose and mean HbA1c in each trimester, maternal hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, gestational age at delivery, preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks' gestation, preterm birth &lt; 32 weeks' gestation, Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, macrosomia, small-for-gestational age, mean birthweight, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal hypoglycaemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, and fetal anomaly.</P>
<P>In two trials, including a total of 61 infants, CSII was associated with an increase in mean birthweight compared with MDI. However, this result was not repeated for macrosomia rate or large-for-gestational age, suggesting uncertainty in effect.</P>
<P>Many important outcomes were not reported, including most GRADE outcomes: hypertensive disorders, maternal development of type 2 diabetes, induction of labour, perineal trauma, return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression, mortality or morbidity composite, adiposity, and subsequent offspring type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There was no longer-term follow-up of the infants in these studies. Information on health service use is also lacking, with length of postnatal stay reported in only one study of 10 women.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-18 14:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The trials included are small and include few women. Three were undertaken in the 1980s, one in the 1990s and since this time pump technology has advanced. Therefore, adequately powered trials that report all outcomes suggested by this review to evaluate patch pumps compared with MDI and more conventional CSII with MDI or use a multi-factorial approach are required.</P>
<P>There were no trials of appropriate methodological quality that assessed the use of MDI versus CSII for women with GDM. Prevalence of GDM is increasing and these women may require insulin; this is a group of women who should be included in future trials.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-05-05 12:29:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this review were small, with few participants, the quality of reporting was poor and therefore generally risk of bias was unclear. It is not possible to blind participants or clinicians to intervention allocation in trials such as those in this review, however outcome assessors can be blinded and this was not reported. We do not know if the women who participated were representative of the general population of women with diabetes, and therefore if the results can be generalised, one trial <LINK REF="STD-Nosari-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nosari 1993</LINK> reported that their participants were 'highly motivated'. Researchers should try to ensure by using appropriate methods that their trial population reflects the general obstetric population of women with diabetes as closely as possible. </P>
<P>Most GRADE outcomes were not reported. For the GRADE outcomes that were reported, our assessment was that the evidence is <I>very low quality</I> (<B>caesarean section, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, </B>and<B> neonatal hypoglycaemia</B>). This was due to design limitations in the included trials, small sample sizes in those studies contributing data, wide confidence intervals crossing both the line of no effect and the line of appreciable benefit and/or harm, and often few events. These judgements are shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. We are therefore uncertain whether CSII or MDI improves outcomes for pregnant women with diabetes and their infants.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-04-21 13:53:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The assessment of risk of bias involves subjective judgements. This potential limitation is minimised by following the procedures in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), with two or more review authors independently assessing studies and resolving any disagreement through discussion, and if required involving a third assessor in the decision. We undertook a comprehensive, systematic search of databases to reduce the potential for publication bias, without language or publication status restrictions. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-18 14:03:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Our finding, that the limited and potentially low-quality evidence prevents the drawing of meaningful conclusions regarding the effectiveness of one method of insulin administration over another in pregnancy for women requiring insulin supports the findings of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Mukhopadhyay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhopadhyay 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Mukhopadhyay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhopadhyay 2007</LINK> suggests their results do not demonstrate a clear-cut benefit of CSII over MDI and that large randomised trials are required comparing newer pumps which use rapid acting insulin analogues with MDI. Similar to our recommendations, the authors suggest cost-effectiveness analyses are undertaken.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 15:59:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present there are insufficient data to draw conclusions in relation to the effectiveness of one method of insulin administration over another. Both methods appear to have advantages and disadvantages, though these are often not reported by trials. Decisions regarding the use of different administration methods in the context of pregnancy should therefore be made according to individual needs and available resources.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-21 13:57:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large multi-centre randomised, adequately powered trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple daily injections for women with diabetes (GDM and pre-existing) in pregnancy who require insulin. It would be beneficial if outcomes were consistent across trials and included women's preferences. Further trials to assess the effects of pumps on birthweight and macrosomia rates are needed. Future trials should undertake longer-term follow-up of participants (women and their infants) as well as assessment of associated costs.</P>

<P>CSII versus MDI. Participants were hospitalised initially in order to achieve optimal glycaemic control, diet was prescribed according to individual needs. A Microject MC 20 portable syringe pump was used with porcine insulin (Actrapid MC) 40 U/mL, adjustments were made to the dosage in order to obtain strict glycaemic control (fasting BG &lt; 80 + 10 mg/dL, postprandial BG &lt; 120 mg/dL). Participants randomised to the MDI dose were given Actrapid MC split into 4 boluses.</P>
