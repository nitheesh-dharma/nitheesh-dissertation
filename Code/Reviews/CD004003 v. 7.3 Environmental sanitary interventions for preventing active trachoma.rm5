<TITLE>Environmental sanitation measures to reduce trachoma transmission</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-05 13:31:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Trachoma is the commonest cause of preventable vision loss and is common in poor communities. Repeated bouts of conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia infection lead to scarring and turning in of the eyelid. The lashes rub the cornea causing opacification and blindness. Environmental sanitation is a package of measures aimed at eliminating factors that encourage proliferation of flies and the spread of the disease. Some of these interventions include provision of water and latrines as well insecticide spray to control flies and health education programmes to improve the personal and environmental hygienic practices of the people. We included six studies involving 12,294 participants of different ages and both sexes in this review. The trials were conducted in The Gambia, Mali, Tanzania, Niger and Ethiopia. Two studies looked at insecticide spray, one looked at insecticide spray and provision of latrines, one study looked at provision of latrines, and two studies looked at health education with one of them having health education combined with water supply. Prevalence of active trachoma, prevalence of <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> and fly count measures were the main outcomes assessed. Two studies conducted in the same area found insecticide spray effective in reducing active trachoma but one study in a different setting found the spray ineffective. A separate study found health education on personal and environmental hygiene to be effective in reducing active trachoma, however, another study found that a modest health education programme combined with a modest water supply was not effective in reducing active trachoma. One study on latrine provision found no impact on trachoma. However, more research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-01-05 13:30:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Trachoma is a major cause of avoidable blindness. It is responsible for about six million blind people worldwide, mostly in the poor communities of developing countries. One of the major strategies advocated for the control of the disease is the application of various environmental sanitary measures to such communities. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of environmental sanitary measures on the prevalence of active trachoma in endemic areas. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-20 15:17:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1950 to September 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to September 2011), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 23 September 2011. We checked the reference list of included trials and the Science Citation Index. We also contacted agencies, experts and researchers in trachoma control.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any form of environmental hygiene measures with no measure. These hygiene measures included fly control, provision of water and health education. Participants in the trials were people normally resident in the trachoma endemic areas. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-05 13:29:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the included trials. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Six trials met the inclusion criteria but we did not conduct meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of the studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 13:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included six studies with a total of 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies that assessed insecticide spray as a fly control measure found that trachoma is reduced by at least 55% to 61% with this measure compared to no intervention. However, another study did not find insecticide spray to be effective in reducing trachoma. One study found that another fly control measure, latrine provision, reduced trachoma by 29.5% compared to no intervention; this was, however, not statistically significantly different and findings have not been confirmed by a more recent study. Another study revealed that health education reduced the incidence of trachoma. These findings were not confirmed by a second study, however, which found that a modest health education programme with modest water supply did not reduce trachoma. However, all the studies have some methodological concerns.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 13:30:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There is some evidence from two trials that insecticides are effective in reducing trachoma, however, this effect was not demonstrated in another trial that used insecticides. Two trials on latrine provision as a fly control measure have not demonstrated significant trachoma reduction. Health education had shown significant reduction of trachoma in one study but another study did not demonstrate similar findings. Generally there is a dearth of data to determine the effectiveness of all aspects of environmental sanitation in the control of trachoma.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-06 10:55:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trachoma is a chronic infective condition of the eye caused by the micro-organism <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I>. The disease is more prevalent in the poor underprivileged communities of sub Saharan Africa, Asia, South America and the Middle East (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997b</LINK>). It is estimated that there are over 146 million people, mostly children, with active trachoma, a proportion of whom may progress to blindness. About 10 million others have trichiasis (turned-in eyelashes) and are at risk of going blind. Trachoma is responsible for over six million blind people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997a</LINK>). The organism <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> is transmitted from one person to another mostly children who are the reservoir of the disease, by close contact and through contaminated fingers and cloths used to wipe discharge on the faces of children (<LINK REF="REF-Mariotti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariotti 2000</LINK>). Flies are believed to be major transmitters of the disease (<LINK REF="STD-Pruss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pruss 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The disease begins in early childhood. It is characterised by redness of the eye and discharge, with inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva (mucous membrane lining the inner surface of the upper lid) and development of follicles, whitish inflammatory elevations within the conjunctiva. Repeated inflammation from cycles of infection and reinfection causes entropion (distortion of the eyelids), trichiasis, and corneal abrasion. Blindness can subsequently occur due to corneal opacity (loss of corneal clarity).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:53:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have developed the SAFE strategy as a comprehensive strategy for control of the disease. This entails eyelid surgery to correct in-turned eyelashes to prevent corneal abrasion and blindness, antibiotics to treat active trachoma so as to prevent scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva, facial cleanliness and environmental sanitation to break transmission of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997a</LINK>). Cochrane systematic reviews on antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2011</LINK>) and face washing (<LINK REF="REF-Ejere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejere 2004</LINK>) have already been published.</P>
<P>Environmental sanitation is a package of measures aimed at eliminating factors that encourage proliferation of flies and the spread of the disease in the environment. Some of these factors include poor faecal and refuse disposal, presence of animal pens within human households and inadequate water supply. Thus, environmental sanitary interventions include: provision of water; latrines; refuse dumps; insecticide spray to control flies; relocating animal pens away from human households; and health education to improve personal and environmental hygiene (<LINK REF="REF-Mariotti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariotti 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-06 10:55:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is believed that improving the environment can reduce the incidence of trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2000</LINK>) and is likely to lead to more sustainable control of the disease (<LINK REF="STD-Pruss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pruss 2000</LINK>). However, this component of the SAFE strategy is not well defined. Improving the environment covers a wide variety of environmental control measures as described above. These have been implemented in various forms in different communities as part of a global effort to control trachoma. Some traditional reviews of the impact of environmental interventions have been reported. However, the reviews were mostly based on observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pruss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pruss 2000</LINK>). Where controlled trials were included, the methodological quality and selection criteria were not adequately specified. A systematic review is needed to summa rise the best available evidence from trials of the impact of environmental interventions on active trachoma in endemic communities.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2011-09-20 13:46:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The primary outcome for this review was active trachoma measured as the number of participants with trachoma follicular inflammation (TF) or trachoma intense inflammation (TI), as defined below; at any follow-up period reported in the trials. Active trachoma was defined using the Thylefors (1987) scale (<LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK>). On this scale, active trachoma is categorised as trachoma follicular inflammation (TF) or trachoma intense inflammation (TI). Trachoma follicular inflammation is defined as the presence of five or more follicles, each of which is at least 0.5 mm in diameter, on the flat surface of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Trachoma intense inflammation is defined as the presence of marked inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the deep conjunctival vessels.</P>
<P>We planned to include trials that used other trachoma grading scales provided the scales used could be related to the Thylefors (1987) scale.</P>

<P>Due to the six trials included in this review having significant clinical heterogeneity we presented a narrative summary of the results of the trials. If additional trials become available in future we will analyse them as follows: data will be combined in a meta-analysis if appropriate using the random-effects model. If there are fewer than three studies we will use a fixed-effect model. In analysing cluster-randomised trials, if a meta-analysis is not possible a tabulated summary of results will be presented.</P>

<P>We planned to assess heterogeneity by visual examination of the forest plot. In the protocol we pre-specified the following subgroups of interest however at present there are not enough data to explore these fully: communities with intense active trachoma versus communities with less intense active trachoma. Intense active trachoma is defined in this review as communities with a baseline prevalence of TF and/or TI equal to or greater than 20% among children less than 10 years, while less intense is defined as communities with a prevalence of TF and/or TI less than 20% amongst children less than 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997b</LINK>).</P>

<P>The initial electronic searches generated 335 citations and abstracts. These were independently screened by two authors and the full texts of 11 potentially relevant articles were retrieved. Two authors again independently assessed these articles. Many of these articles were observational studies, reviews and overviews of studies or journal editorials. We considered three trials for inclusion <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 1983</LINK>). A third author resolved any disagreements in the selection of the three studies. Of the three studies, we excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sutter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 1983</LINK>) after contacting the investigators as it was confirmed to be an observational study. One other ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK>) was finally published and after assessment we included it. Thus three studies were included in the original published version of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>Updated searches were done in November 2006 and July 2007. For the 2006 search the Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) scanned the search results (a total of 80 reports) and removed any references which were not relevant to the scope of the review. Nineteen reports were identified for potential inclusion in the review and the abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by two authors. One new trial <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK> met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. The 2007 search identified 19 new reports of studies but none met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK> was a cluster-randomised study conducted in the Oulessebougou district of Mali. A total of 1810 people of all ages in four villages were randomised into three intervention groups and one control group. Of these, 1334 people in three villages were assigned to different intervention groups and 476 people in one village were assigned to the control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK> was a community based cluster- (quasi) randomised study conducted in Sangal area of The Gambia. A total of 1134 people of all ages in four villages (clusters) were allocated to intervention (insecticide spray for fly control) or control (no intervention) in sets of two villages for wet and dry seasons. Two villages with a population of 588 people received insecticide spray, while the remaining two villages with a population of 546 people did not receive any intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK> was a community based cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted in the North Bank and Central River division of The Gambia. A total of 7080 people (aged four months and older) in 21 clusters (one or more close neighbouring rural communities) were randomised in sets of three clusters to receive insecticide spray, latrines or control. As such, all the seasons in the study area were covered in seven stages. Seven clusters, with a total of 2244 people, received insecticide spray, seven other clusters, with a population of 2230, received latrines; while the remaining seven clusters, with a population of 2606, received no intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK> was a community based randomised controlled trial undertaken in Kongwa Tanzania in which 302 children one to seven years old in 16 Balozi (clusters) were randomised in two years. Each year eight Balozi were randomised into four intervention and four control clusters. In total 119 children in eight intervention Balozi and 183 children in eight control Balozi were enrolled. The households in the intervention clusters were sprayed with insecticide throughout the year, while the households in the control Balozi did not receive any intervention. At baseline all residents of both intervention and control Balozi were treated with one dose of azithromycin.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK> was a community based cluster-randomised study in Maradi district of Niger in West Africa. A total of 557 children aged one to five years old in 12 villages were randomised into six villages for intervention and six villages as control, although data were only collected on 10 of these villages. The intervention villages had at least one clean water well constructed and a three month modest health education programme was executed three months prior to the two year survey. The control villages had no well constructed and no specific health education programmes. But villages in both arms of the study had access to the regular trachoma radio messages.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stoller-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stoller 2011</LINK> was a cluster-randomised trial in Ethiopia investigating the effects of intensive latrine promotion on emergence of infection with ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> after mass treatment with antibiotics. A total of 24 communities were included in the study and followed up for 24 months. The construction of a simple pit latrine by participating households using locally available materials was currently in progress in the study area; in the intervention villages health workers and additional sanitation volunteers intensified the promotion and provided free latrine slabs and training on the construction of the latrine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK>, people in each intervention village were assigned to antibiotics and health education, health education alone, or antibiotics alone. They were compared with people from the control village who did not receive any intervention. We were interested specifically in the comparisons between health education alone versus no intervention. The health education programme was based on community participation and consisted of repeated information concerning personal and family hygiene, including household sanitation. The information also concerned trachoma and its complications as well as elements of primary health care. The programme was specifically directed towards women and school children. Posters and booklets were specially designed for this. The programme was conducted at a frequency of one week per month for the six-month period of the survey.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK>, the insecticide spray villages had 0.175% volume to volume deltamethrin applied by ultra-low-volume application within and up to 20 metres outside each village. The spray consisted of an attack phase of spraying every two days for two weeks followed by a maintenance phase of spraying twice weekly in the wet season and once weekly in the dry season.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK>, the insecticide spray clusters had space spraying with permethrin for six months. The spray was based on an attack phase of spraying every two days for two weeks to kill the adult fly population followed by a maintenance phase of spraying twice a week. The clusters assigned to latrine provision had Gambian improved household pit latrines (non-ventilated). One latrine was allocated per household or 20 people, whichever allowed the most latrines. Latrines were located less than six metres from the households. The control clusters did not receive any intervention.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>, in each intervention Balozi (neighbourhood), a solution of 10% permethrin in water was sprayed inside houses, compounds, cattle pens, around yards, latrines and in between houses using a sprayer machine. The spraying was commenced with an attack phase of spraying every two days for two weeks and then a maintenance of once per week for the rest of the study period.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK> the intervention villages had at least one hand pump well constructed (range of one to three wells) over the two year period. However, all villages at the start of the trial were not far from the source of water but it was not easily portable. The new wells provided much safer water than the existing ones.</P>
<P>The health education programme was implemented three months prior to the two year survey. A male village health worker was given the role of health educator; and provided a two day training programme on the spread of trachoma through lack of hygiene and flies. The health worker used flip charts and interactive discussions in one or two village meetings to highlight the importance of using portable water, latrines, environmental sanitation, garbage control and washing faces to minimise trachoma transmission.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Stoller-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stoller 2011</LINK> the construction of a simple pit latrine by participating households using locally available materials was currently in progress in the study area; in the intervention villages health workers and additional sanitation volunteers intensified the promotion and provided free latrine slabs and training on the construction of the latrine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK>, outcome was assessed in the study as incidence of active trachoma determined by the cumulative number of new cases of active trachoma within the six-month study period. Active trachoma was defined using the Thylefors (1987) grading scheme. Incidence as an outcome was not in our protocol but post-hoc we realised that it could be a valuable outcome in assessing impact of trachoma intervention programmes.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK>, outcome measures recorded in the study included prevalence of active trachoma, fly density measures (fly-eye contact, fly population) and adverse effects of insecticides. Active trachoma was graded using the WHO (Thylefors) simplified grading scheme. Fly-eye contact was measured only in the dry season by hand-net collection of flies that touched the eyes of 10 seated children for 15 minutes, measured fortnightly. Fly population was measured by determining the number of flies caught by four fish-baited traps placed in each village at an animal-tethering area, in a latrine, at the centre of a domestic compound and at the main meeting point, measured for 24 hours every two weeks. How adverse effects of insecticides were determined was not stated.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK>, outcome measures included prevalence of active trachoma, fly-eye contact (a measure of fly density) and latrine utilisation. Active trachoma was defined by using the Thylefors (1987) simplified grading scheme. Fly density was determined by measuring the number of flies making contact with the eyes of volunteer children of less than five years i.e. fly-eye contact. This was achieved by catching all the flies making contact with the eyes of the children using eight hand nets. Contact with the eyes was defined as flies touching the eye, lid margins or lashes. The fly catch was done once every two weeks in each cluster. The catch was done on the same days, same time and locations for each cluster. Latrine utilisation was determined by visual inspection once a week for the first month and once a month thereafter. The inspection involved monitoring presence of adequate screening, faeces in the pit, flies around the latrine slab and a path worn to the latrine.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>, outcome measures were prevalence of active trachoma in children under eight years at baseline, six months and one year after mass antibiotic treatment, infection prevalence rates, fly count in each Balozi. Active trachoma was defined by using the Thylefors (1987) WHO simplified grading scheme. Infection prevalence rates referred to presence of <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> from an ocular swab as measured with a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. While the fly count was mean number of flies captured per day in the intervention versus the control Balozi. The flies were captured by two fly paper strips placed in every Balozi at the same spot every week over the course of the year.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK>, outcome measures used were prevalence of active trachoma (presence of TF and or TI) and infection rates from a randomly selected sample of one to five year olds at baseline, one year and two year periods. Active trachoma was graded by assessing both eyes using the WHO simplified grading scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK>), while infection rate was assessed by taking a right eye swab using Dacron swab and analysing for <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> using Amplicor qualitative PCR. Infection was defined as a positive laboratory result.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Stoller-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stoller 2011</LINK> the main outcome measures were ocular <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection and active trachoma in children aged 0 to 9 years. Household latrine coverage and use were also estimated.</P>

<P>It is difficult to mask participants and caregivers to community-based interventions and all the included studies were considered to be at high risk of performance bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK> the outcome assessors were not masked either so was considered to be at high risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>In the other studies, attempts were made to mask outcome assessment. For outcomes such as clinical grading of active trachoma we graded risk of bias as unclear in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoller-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stoller 2011</LINK>) because even though the outcome assessor may not know the intervention status of the community, it is possible that the participants could have provided this information. However, other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>) used photographic grading of active trachoma for which it was possible to mask the outcome assessors properly and we graded these as low risk of bias. Similarly, for laboratory outcomes such as measuring <I>C.trachomatis</I> infection, these could be masked successfully (<LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoller-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stoller 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Measurements of the number of flies again were probably difficult to mask and none of the studies that reported these outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>) mentioned any attempts to mask assessment so this was considered to be high risk of bias.</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2012-01-06 10:56:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We considered two other potential sources of bias relevant to cluster-randomised trials: recruitment bias and baseline imbalance.</P>
<P>None of the studies discussed recruitment bias. In general we felt that these trials were at low risk of recruitment bias because the community-level interventions, such as fly spraying and latrine provision would be unlikely to affect response to the study assessments.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:02:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Of the trials included in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK> assessed the effect of two different fly control measures i.e. insecticide spray and latrine provision; <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK> assessed insecticide spray only; and <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK> assessed the impact of health education on trachoma.</P>
<P>However, the two trials involving insecticide spray had significant clinical heterogeneity and, therefore, conducting a meta-analysis was not appropriate. The studies were conducted for different durations as <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK> had the intervention applied for three months, while <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2004</LINK> had the intervention applied for six months. The studies must have been carried out at different seasons of the year (a factor known to affect fly population and likely trachoma transmission). We have, therefore, presented a narrative summary of these trials.</P>
<P>Also the two trials involving health education i.e. <LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK> are widely heterogeneous in their interventions as one used health education only (<LINK REF="STD-Resnikoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Resnikoff 1995</LINK>) and the other used a combined health education and water supply (<LINK REF="STD-Abdou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdou 2010</LINK>), thus the two trials cannot be combined for meta-analysis, we have therefore presented a narrative summary of the trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health education</HEADING>
<P>Two trials assessed heath education but one assessed health education versus no intervention while the other assessed health education and water supply versus no intervention. The former trial suggested that health education reduced transmission of active trachoma as well as reduced the prevalence of active trachoma at six months with the odds of reducing trachoma about double in the health education village. However, this study has only one cluster (village) for each trial arm. A single village per intervention has no variability. As such it is difficult to determine whether differences between villages were due to intervention or inherent differences in the villages. Furthermore the outcome assessor was not masked and the analysis may not have considered the differences in the unit of allocation and analysis.The second trial using health education and water supply versus no intervention demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the intervention and control villages in terms of active trachoma rate and infection rate as determined by the presence of <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I>. However, in this trial the interventions provided may not have been sufficient enough to result in a difference between the intervention and control arms considering the fact that health education was only provided three months before the end of the trial. Health education is expected to change the attitudes and practices of the people to enhance personal and environmental hygiene which will reduce transmission of the disease. However, for such a change to take place and translate into reduced infection, longer periods of time are needed, especially as the incubation period of the diseases can be as long as 28 days (<LINK REF="REF-Grassly-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grassly 2008</LINK>).Furthermore it was stated that both trial arm villages had access to regular trachoma control messages on the radio. As such both study groups might have had almost similar health education messages. Even the water supply provided to the intervention villages, may seem inadequate because only one to three wells were built in each of the intervention villages with a population of 600 to 1200 people each. Also it was stated that intervention and control villages at the beginning of the survey were not far from the source of water. So the hand pump water well constructed in the intervention villages may not have made a significant difference to the control villages as far as water availability is concerned. The methodological quality of the study is also inadequate. At baseline the intervention villages had a significantly higher prevalence of <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> infection rates, a higher proportion of three to four year olds and a higher proportion of children living in compounds where garbage is observed within. This may suggest that there was higher risk factors and burden of disease in the intervention villages to which a wider margin of reduction is needed to be achieved to demonstrate difference with the control villages. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fly control interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two trials that assessed fly control measures included in this review agreed that insecticide spray significantly reduced the magnitude of active trachoma, by at least 55%, as well as markedly reducing the density of house flies by as much as 88% to 92%.One trial, however, did not find a significant effect of fly control by insecticide spray in the reduction of active trachoma.</P>
<P>The difference in these trials is difficult to explain. However, factors that may have influenced the variation in the result may include the fact that the magnitude of the disease at baseline varies significantly in the two study areas. The Gambian study may be said to have been done in a trachoma hypoendemic area while the Tanzania trial was done in a hyperendemic area. Thus the role of flies in the transmission of the disease as well as the effect of fly control may differ in the two settings. In Tanzania the role of flies in transmission of trachoma may be limited as an earlier study in similar Tanzanian communities had shown that face washing promotion is effective in reducing active trachoma in communities with a higher burden of the disease. Also the Tanzanian study at baseline applied mass antibiotics treatment in both the intervention and control groups. This might have significantly cleared the trachoma infection in the communities such that transmission was stalled. As such fly control may not show any effect on the disease.</P>
<P>The role of insecticide spray for the control of trachoma remains unclear. It is pertinent that more studies in different settings are undertaken to ascertain the significance of fly and fly control in prevention of trachoma and possibly other diseases in different settings.</P>
<P>As it is, flies are known vectors not only for trachoma but for other diseases, especially childhood diarrhoeal diseases. As such, insecticide spray is likely to have wider public health relevance in this regard. These studies did not seem to adequately assess the possibility of any untoward effects from such space spraying with insecticides for a prolonged period of time (years). <LINK REF="STD-Emerson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 1999</LINK> reported no adverse effect for the three-month study period, although it was not clear how this conclusion was reached. Another concern for the application of this intervention is its sustainability. Community insecticide spray intervention will require continuous engagement of human and material resources which are likely to be unsustainable in many poor trachoma communities.</P>
<P>Latrine provision as an interventional measure for trachoma control produced less reduction of active trachoma and house flies than insecticide spray. In fact, the trials included in this review failed to demonstrate a reduction in ocular infection active trachoma with increased latrine provision and use. A likely explanation may be that absence of latrines is only one of the factors responsible for fly proliferation in such trachoma communities. Other factors such as poor garbage disposal, poor personal hygiene, presence of animals and their dung etc., if not tackled as well, may interfere with trachoma reduction. In addition, these studies were conducted in communities with a lower prevalence of active trachoma (6% to 18%); the result may be different when latrines are provided in communities with higher prevalence of active trachoma. Furthermore, the short period of time (three to six months) for the intervention and follow up in two of the studies may have been inadequate to demonstrate the impact of the latrine provision however in a more recent study follow-up continued for 24 months.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-13 15:23:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found three traditional reviews. The reviews included several observational studies on this topic. <LINK REF="REF-Prost-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prost 1989</LINK> reviewed 15 observational studies relating to the effect of water on trachoma and concluded that provision of water seemed to reduce trachoma within the general context of behavioural and environmental factor improvements. However, neither the search procedures nor the inclusion and exclusion criteria used were mentioned in the report. The methodological quality of studies was not assessed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Esrey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Esrey 1991</LINK> reviewed 16 observational studies relating to the effects of improved water supply and sanitation on trachoma and reported that there was significant reduction of trachoma in communities that were closer to the source of water (30% median reduction in trachoma). Studies elsewhere (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-1989" TYPE="STUDY">West 1989</LINK>) have demonstrated that closeness to the source of water may not translate into use of water for hygiene purposes. The review did not include non-English papers and technical/agency reports. There were no details of quality assessments of included studies. Furthermore, the pooling of data from different observational studies with differing confounding factors to determine the median reduction of disease may be subject to bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pruss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pruss 2000</LINK> reviewed 19 studies of which four were stated to be clinical trials and the remainder observational studies. The different studies reported on different environmental parameters ranging from water availability, garbage collection, absence of latrines/toilets, personal hygiene, presence of animals within households and fly control. The authors concluded that both reducing fly densities and hygiene education decreased transmission of trachoma. Personal and domestic hygiene also appeared to have great potential for a sustainable reduction in trachoma transmission. However, the Pruss review did not mention how many assessors selected the included studies. The methods employed in assessing the quality of the studies were not mentioned or how many authors did the assessment. The methods of data extraction from studies and the number of authors that extracted the data were not mentioned. Finally, as in most observational studies the authors attested to the fact that the various environmental confounding factors that had not been adequately controlled may have seriously affected the results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-05 16:11:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Evidence from two trials suggests insecticide spray can reduce transmission of active trachoma, but one trial did not find insecticide spray effective in reduction of active trachoma. Thus the role of insecticide spray in the control of trachoma remains uncertain. On health education one trial suggests that health education may reduce transmission of active trachoma. But another study concluded that provision of modest short-term heath education with improved water supply does not reduce the prevalence of the disease.<BR/>Non-Cochrane reviews, which included mostly observational studies, also suggest a potential benefit of environmental interventions for reducing trachoma in communities. However, it is difficult to rely on this evidence because of validity issues. As we await trials that assess the individual contribution of each component of environment sanitation to the control of trachoma it is difficult to be certain which component of environmental sanitation is more effective. Therefore, all available interventions need to be applied in communities with trachoma, within the context of the SAFE strategy. These interventions include health education on personal and environmental hygiene; water supply and education on water use for hygiene; and fly control measures such as provision of latrines, refuse dumps and insecticide spray.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-05 16:12:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess the effects of the various components of environmental sanitation in the control of trachoma and to give a quantitative measure of the impact of each intervention. Future research needs to consider issues in the design, conduct and analysis of such studies. The study should be a RCT with an adequate number of villages in each arm of the intervention groups. Villages should be allocated to groups by concealed random allocation. Ideally, and in view of the varying responses of people to community interventions, as well as differing mode of transmission of the disease which may vary in different settings, it would be best to undertake trials in different regions of the world and in different seasons of the year. When investigating the impact of health education it is important to consider differing behavioural patterns and attitudes in the uptake of such messages in different communities. Also such interventions should be provided for a reasonable period of time sufficient enough to possibly result in attitudinal changes that can affect the disease, before assessing the impact. In assessing the impact of water supply it is important to measure not only the water availability but also water use for hygiene purposes. The possibility of masking the outcome assessors (by taking pictures of everted lids of participants and assessing them elsewhere, by different people) should be considered. Outcome measures may include both prevalence and incidence of the disease but, due to the lack of association between TF/TI and infection; outcome measures should also include <I>Chlamydia trachomatous</I> infection. Analysis of the data should be based on intention-to-treat analysis and include statistical corrections for correlation among individuals within villages if cluster-randomisation was used.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>&#8220;<I>Within villages, we aimed to randomly select 60 children ages 1 to 5 years as sentinel markers of infection and trachoma. The census data from the house-to house survey that we collected was the basis for selection of children. Stratified random sampling was applied to select no more than one child per mother to minimize clustering of children within households. Of 591 children selected, 557 were examined (94%) at baseline. The same sample of children was surveyed for infection one year (January 2007) and two years (January 2008) later.</I> &#8221; Methods, page 2</P>
<P>"<I>At one year, we re-surveyed 91% of the original sample (91% in intervention and 91% in the control villages). At two years, we re-surveyed 89% of the original sample (89% in the intervention and 88% in the control villages).

<P>All clusters completed trial and loss to follow-up similar in the clusters</P>
<P>"<I>All 21 clusters were recruited and visited at follow-up; 7080 people were recruited from these clusters, and 6087 (86%) were seen at follow-up (figure 1). The number of participants lost to follow-up did not differ between either the spray and control groups (p=0·08) or between the latrine and control groups (p=0·55). The proportion lost because of travelling also did not differ between these groups (p=0·84 and p=0·57, respectively). Participants with active trachoma at baseline were 1·38 (95% CI<BR/>1·01&#8211;1·88) more likely to be lost to follow-up than were those without active trachoma, but the proportions with active trachoma lost to follow-up did not differ between<BR/>the spray and control groups (p=0·71) or between the latrine and control groups (p=0·57).</I> Results, page 1095/1096</P>

<P>However, the distribution of these cases by village is not reported. Using figure 1 (page 109) we can estimate that there were 89 cases of active trachoma in treatment community and 90 cases in control community. The &#8220;cure rate&#8221; in treatment village was 82% (estimated 73 people cured) and 36% in control community (estimated 33 people cured)</P>
