<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP plus AQ) performed better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP plus AS) when treating uncomplicated malaria</P>
<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes that kills thousands of people worldwide. Artemisinin-based combination treatments are strongly advocated, but uncertainty about their availability (and cost) remains a major concern. The review includes four small randomized controlled trials, all from Africa, comparing SP plus AS with SP plus AQ for treating uncomplicated malaria. SP plus AQ performed better at destroying blood parasites at 28 days, although resistance to the drugs may have increased since the trials were performed. Adverse events were poorly reported.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Artemisinin-based combination treatments are strongly advocated, but supplies are limited. Sulfadoxine combined with amodiaquine is an alternative non-artemisinin combination.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP plus AQ) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP plus AS) for treating uncomplicated <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (October 2005), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2005), EMBASE (1988 to October 2005), LILACS (October 2005), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in this field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing SP plus AS with SP plus AQ for treating uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 15:59:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was treatment failure (parasitological or clinical evidence of treatment failure between start of treatment and day 28). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials (775 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All were from areas of high and seasonal malaria transmission in Africa. Fewer participants using SP plus AQ failed treatment by day 28 (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; 652 participants, 3 trials). Even excluding new infections, SP plus AQ performed better (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96; 649 participants, 3 trials). There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments for treatment failure at day 14 (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.78; 775 participants, 4 trials). SP plus AS was more effective at reducing gametocyte carriage at day seven (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.92; 220 participants, 1 trial). One trial reported that one person &#8722; in the SP plus AQ group &#8722; developed severe malaria. Adverse events were poorly reported, but did not seem to differ in type and number between the two treatment combinations.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>SP plus AQ performed better at controlling treatment failure at day 28, but was not as good as SP plus AS at reducing gametocyte carriage at day seven. Careful consideration of local resistance patterns is required because resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine are high in many areas. In order to delay development of resistance to artesunate, the combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine should only be considered where both drugs are known to be effective. Data on adverse events are still lacking.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:31:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting 300 to 500 million people every year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). Of the four malaria parasite species that infect humans, <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> is most common and can cause severe malaria. Uncomplicated malaria is the more frequent presentation but can progress to severe malaria if not adequately treated. The level of immunity to malaria varies with transmission intensity of the setting and age. Residents of high malaria transmission areas usually develop a level of immunity to malaria that increases with age up to about five years. This immunity may protect an individual from developing severe malaria. In areas of low and seasonal malaria transmission, people do not develop immunity and are therefore more susceptible to development of severe malaria.</P>
<P>Effective malaria treatment is important to minimize the effects of malaria and is a major control strategy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). Parasite resistance to many of the available antimalarial drugs continues to be a problem and makes effective treatment of malaria episodes difficult. Chloroquine had been first-line treatment until the 1990s when parasite resistance led to its replacement with other regimens (<LINK REF="REF-White-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1998</LINK>). Parasites have developed resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine rapidly because its long half life encourages the selection of the resistant parasites; some fear that it will become completely ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warsame-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warsame 2002</LINK>). As a consequence, the search for effective antimalarial regimens continues; new antimalarial drugs are not being developed fast enough to meet the demand, and new ways of using already available drugs are being explored.</P>
<P>Combination therapy, when two or more antimalarial drugs with different modes of action are used together, is a widely recommended strategy for increasing the effectiveness of the component drugs and delaying the development of resistance to them (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>). In particular, artemisinin-based combination treatments are recommended because the artemisinin drug produces rapid clinical and parasitological response, may delay the development of resistance, and may reduce malaria transmission by killing gametocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Adjuik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adjuik 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several countries in Africa have either changed or are considering changing their treatment policies to artesunate (an artemisinin drug) combined with amodiaquine, or other artemisinin-containing regimens. Although artemisinin-based combinations have been shown to be effective, implementing any policy involving their use could be faced with several problems, namely poor availability since artemisinin drugs are not yet widely available in Africa and may not be for some time because of low production, comparatively high cost, dosing complexity, and the lack of clinical experience with artemisinin-based combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Bloland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>SP and amodiaquine are both widely available and inexpensive. There has been interest in combining these two drugs, and recent studies in Africa have explored this possibility. The studies have shown that SP combined with amodiaquine (SP plus amodiaquine) may be comparable to SP combined with artesunate (SP plus artesunate) for treating malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Bloland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 2003</LINK>). The World Health Organization's Roll Back Malaria programme recommends using SP plus amodiaquine in areas where efficacy of both drugs is high (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of these combinations may be associated with unwanted adverse effects, possibly not observed when either drug is used singly. In particular there have been concerns about the safety profile of amodiaquine (<LINK REF="REF-Olliaro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olliaro 2004</LINK>), though a recent systematic review found no evidence of increased risks of serious adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-MacLehose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLehose 2003</LINK>). Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is rarely associated with severe adverse reactions in standard treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sturchler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturchler 1993</LINK>). Some artemisinin derivatives have been associated with fatal neurotoxicity in animals, and transient first-degree heart block has been reported in a few people taking artemisinin drugs, but artesunate itself seems to be well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000b</LINK>). It is however still important to look out for any adverse events that may occur. We therefore compared SP plus amodiaquine with SP plus artesunate for treating uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria.</P>
<P>We have examined pragmatic outcomes, which include clinical endpoints. Treatment failure by day 28 is our primary outcome because this captures the majority of failures with these drugs, and recent evidence has shown that measures before this time underestimate the true failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>). Parasitaemia after day 14 could be the result of a new infection and some studies detect these new infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, a method that can be used to differentiate between new and old infections; we also examined the outcome of treatment failure by day 28 with new infections excluded.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Four trials are included in this review. The data come from mainly high malaria transmission areas in Africa, but the level of background resistance to the component drugs of the combinations is not clear. All trials enrolled children aged six to 59 months. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials could not be conclusively determined as a consequence of poor reporting but is believed to be generally good. Three trials had adequate generation of allocation sequence, but only one had adequate allocation concealment and only two used blinding. None of the trials included all the enrolled participants in the final analysis, although losses to follow up were within acceptable limits and the reasons for exclusion and loss to follow up were always given. </P>
<P>All trials compared SP plus AQ with SP plus AS, and all used the same dose and regimens and in a similar population. This has made comparison of reported outcomes possible. </P>
<P>Reported outcomes were treatment failure, progression to severe malaria, and gametocyte carriage. Three trials mentioned adverse events, but none of them in sufficient detail and none described the procedure to assess them, which create uncertainty over the completeness of these data. Some of the trials reported on symptom resolution (parasite clearance and fever clearance), but this was not reported in a format that could be used in this review and therefore it has not been possible to report them here. </P>
<P>The combination of SP plus AQ resulted in better cure of malaria when assessed at day 28. At day 14 the result was not conclusive and it is not possible to determine which, if any, treatment is better than the other at this point. These observed effects may be because the longer acting amodiaquine still offers protection beyond day 14 compared to artesunate, which is quickly eliminated from the body and whose effect in the combination lasts a short time. If artesunate has disappeared from the patient's system and there is resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine then day 28 cure rates are likely to be very low unless the patient has some level of immunity to malaria.<BR/> <BR/>SP plus AS was better at controlling gametocytes than SP plus AQ. This result, as may be expected, is because the artesunate component (like the other artemisinin drugs) is effective in destroying gametocytes. </P>
<P>There are presently insufficient data to determine the effects of the two treatments on outcomes such as symptom resolution and adverse events. </P>
<P>Although there was little statistical heterogeneity in results across trials, some caution is still required to generalize from four small trials carried out at different times, in separate parts of Africa, and with different malaria transmission intensities. All these trials took place at a time of rapid spread of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance and the emergence of amodiaquine resistance. Resistance patterns may have worsened since the trials were carried out, particularly for the SP plus AQ combination. Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has spread rapidly across Africa and manifests initially as recrudescence of the same parasite genotype between 14 and 28 days or longer. Combination therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is therefore likely to be a 'stop-gap' measure until artemisinin-based combination therapies are widely available, or limited to areas with documented low sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. It is possible that sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may not be recommended at all for first-line treatment of any malaria in Africa in the future. The SP plus AQ combination should therefore only be considered where both sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine resistance (measured at 28 days) are known to be low. It is particularly important that effective drugs (such as artesunate, with no documented resistance) are protected and not exposed to the possibility of developing resistance by partnering them with ineffective drugs. This also implies that SP plus AS combination therapy should only be considered where both drugs are known to be effective.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In these trials, SP plus AQ was better than SP plus AS at controlling treatment failure at day 28, but there are insufficient data to determine performance at day 14. Careful consideration of local resistance patterns is however required, as resistance to both sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine are high in many areas and may be worsening. In order to delay development of resistance to artesunate, the SP plus AS combination should only be considered in areas where both drugs are known to be effective. Data on adverse events are still lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that include outcomes on symptom resolution and adverse effects are needed. These are not only important to help further assess effectiveness and safety but are also of particular interest to people with malaria. Trial methodology needs to be reported more clearly. Research in other locations (such as Central Asia) where sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is more effective might be useful.</P>
