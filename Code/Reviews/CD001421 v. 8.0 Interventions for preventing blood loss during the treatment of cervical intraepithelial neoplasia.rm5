<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery for pre-cancerous cervix lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) often causes significant bleeding during surgery or within 14 days. This review found that good surgical technique can reduce immediate blood loss and bleeding can also be reduced by some drugs. Vasopressin reduces blood flow by constricting blood vessels. Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss after knife and laser cone biopsy. Stitches also reduce blood loss but can interfere with later visual examination of the cervix.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve RCTs (N = 1602, of whom 1512 were assessed) were included. </P>
<P>Vasopressin significantly reduced perioperative bleeding (mean difference (MD) = -100.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -129.48 to -72.12) and was associated with a decreased risk of bleeding that required haemostatic sutures or further vasopressin, compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.39, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.56).</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid significantly reduced risk of secondary haemorrhage (RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.50), but not primary haemorrhage (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 38.23) after knife and laser cone biopsy, compared with placebo. There was also a statistically significant reduction in postoperative blood loss compared with placebo (MD = -55.60, 95% CI -94.91 to -16.29).</P>
<P>Packing with Monsel's solution resulted in less perioperative blood loss (MD = -22.00, 95% CI -23.09 to -20.91) and decreased the risk of dysmenorrhoea (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.84), unsatisfactory colposcopy (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.63) and cervical stenosis (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.49) compared to routine suturing, but was not statistically different to sutures for risk of primary and secondary haemorrhages.</P>
<P>Amino-Cerv antibiotic gel failed to make a difference on secondary haemorrhage but was associated with significantly less vaginal discharge at 2 weeks compared with routine care (RR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.86).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in blood loss between women who received ball electrode diathermy and those who received Monsel's paste (MD = 4.82, 95% CI -3.45 to 13.09).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bleeding associated with surgery of the cervix appears to be reduced by vasopressin, used in combination with local anaesthetic. Tranexamic acid appears to be beneficial after knife and laser cone biopsy. There are insufficient data to assess the effects on primary haemorrhage. There is some evidence that haemostatic suturing has an adverse effect on blood loss, cervical stenosis and satisfactory colposcopy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2002</LINK>). A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.8% in developed countries to 1.5% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2002</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>). Cervical screening aims to identify women with asymptomatic disease, treat the disease with a low morbidity procedure, and thus lower the risk of developing invasive disease. In countries with effective screening programmes, there have been dramatic reductions in the incidence of disease and the stage of disease of cancer, if disease is diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>). Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the most common pre-malignant lesion characterised by atypical squamous changes in the transformation zone of the cervix; with mild, moderate or severe changes described by their depth (CIN 1, 2 or 3). If CIN progresses it becomes squamous cancer; in contrast, the much rarer glandular pre-cancerous abnormalities (cervical glandular intra-epithelial neoplasia; CGIN) develop into cervical adenocarcinoma.</P>
<P>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of pre-cancerous abnormalities of the cervix. HPV has over 100 subtypes and is present in over 95% of preinvasive and invasive squamous carcinomas of the cervix. Serotypes associated with cervical squamous lesions may be designated as having a high or low risk for progression to malignancy. HPV infection in young women is commonly a transient infection and the body's own immune response clears the disease from the cervical tissues. If pre-invasive disease has been present and the immunological response clears HPV infection then the pre-invasive disease will resolve. Sexually active young women under 30 years of age have a very high rate of HPV infection whilst women over 30 years of age have a much lower HPV infection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Sargent-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sargent 2008</LINK>). This is a reflection of the natural history of disease with a 50% regression rate and only a 10% progression rate of low grade CIN in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Ostor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostor 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The frequency of abnormal Papanicolaou smear test results and subsequent CIN varies with the population tested, the test used and accuracy reported. It is estimated to range between 1.5 to 6% (<LINK REF="REF-Cirisano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cirisano 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>When CIN is identified, colposcopists generally treat CIN 2 or high grade disease and either observe or immediately treat CIN 1 depending on personal preference. The majority of treatments can be associated with perioperative bleeding. This can obviously make the procedures technically difficult, and can cause anxiety to the patient. This review evaluated interventions designed to reduce blood loss associated with treatment of CIN.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical treatments for CIN are commonly associated with immediate and long term complications. The majority of surgical therapies (knife or laser cone biopsy, large loop excision, laser ablation) can cause significant bleeding during the procedure, within the first 24 hours (primary haemorrhage) or within the first 14 days (secondary haemorrhage). They can also result in persistent bleeding or discharge following treatment. Surgical trauma to the cervix can result in disruption of the anatomy of the cervix, prohibiting adequate colposcopy if the transformation zone is within the canal or narrowing of the cervical canal, which can result in dysmenorrhoea.</P>
<P>Reduction of immediate blood loss during surgical treatment can be achieved by good operator technique and may be enhanced by various interventions.</P>
<P>Knife cone biopsy is still commonly performed for the treatment of CIN despite the advent of out-patient excisional treatment. Many authorities still recommend knife cone biopsy, if the squamo-columnar junction is deep in the cervical canal or if there is suspicion of invasive disease or glandular intra-epithelial neoplasia, as excision is likely to be in a single specimen and to reduce the risk of diathermy damage. Knife cone biopsy is associated with a higher morbidity compared to other modalities of treatment, particularly for obstetric outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kyrgiou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyrgiou 2004</LINK>). The majority of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) available have examined different interventions designed to reduce morbidity during knife cone biopsy.</P>
<P>Vasopressin is commonly used in combination with local analgesics for out-patient ablative or excisional treatments.</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent) has been advocated as a prophylactic measure against significant secondary bleeding after knife cone biopsy. It is not commonly used in current practice.</P>
<P>The surgical technique of knife cone biopsy has been poorly evaluated by RCTs. Modifications in cutting technique, cautery to wound and haemostatic suturing have all been advocated.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of the review completed in 1999. Since then, further trials have come to light which are suitable for inclusion and may increase the evidence base. The initial review mapped out the evidence but most interventions were not investigated by well conducted studies and a minority investigated interventions that are not commonly used in clinical practice. This updated review has been conducted to assess the current evidence base ten years after the original review.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:57:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 12 trials, enrolling 1602 women, that met our inclusion criteria. These trials compared a variety of interventions aimed at reducing morbidity in women with CIN who underwent surgery, including intracervical vasopressin (a potent vasoconstrictor), tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent), vaginal pack, haemostatic and cerclage sutures, electrical coagulation, Amino-Cerv, ball electrode and Monsel's paste. The evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Sabol-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sabol 1971</LINK>, which assessed 92 women suggested that vasopressin reduces perioperative bleeding during surgical treatment of the cervix. However, the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK> showed no evidence of subjective troublesome bleeding, although there were only 50 women in this trial and seven cases of troublesome bleeding.</P>
<P>The comparison of tranexamic acid versus control includes the only meta-analyses in the review. However, the evidence is inconsistent as tranexamic acid appears to significantly reduce postoperative blood loss and the incidence of secondary haemorrhage, but there were conflicting results regarding primary haemorrhage. This is probably a reflection of the low incidence of primary haemorrhage and the small number of women recruited in the trials.</P>
<P>Vaginal packs during knife cone surgery (conisation) appear to reduce morbidity compared to elective haemostatic sutures. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1989</LINK>, packs significantly reduced the amount of perioperative blood loss, reduced the risk of dysmenorrhoea and, unlike haemostatic sutures, did not promote migration of the transformation zone into the cervical canal preventing satisfactory colposcopy and cervical stenosis. There was no evidence of a difference between the two interventions for primary and secondary haemorrhage and amenorrhoea, but there did seem to be a statistically non-significant benefit in favour of vaginal packs.</P>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Dane-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dane 2008</LINK>, it appeared that cerclage sutures were more beneficial than electrical coagulation as the duration of treatment was shorter and more women received a satisfactory colposcopy. There was no evidence of a difference between cerclage sutures and coagulation in the number of women who had primary and secondary haemorrhages and dysmenorrhoea, but there did seem to be a statistically non-significant benefit in favour of the sutures.</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence as to whether Amino-Cerv or routine care, prilocaine with felypressin or lignocaine with adrenaline and ball electrode or Monsel's solution were best for reducing morbidity after surgery for CIN. The evidence for all these comparisons came from small single trials so the results are unconvincing.</P>
<P>The main limitation of this review is that there are many single trial analyses so the conclusions are very tentative as none of these trials were sufficiently large. Many of the analyses showed the magnitude of the point estimate to be large, but due to the uncertainty, no statistically significant difference was observed. This was largely because the trials reported relatively few morbidities and so lacked the statistical power to detect any difference in risk that might be present.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review consists of many single trial analyses of small numbers of participants which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. In modern day colposcopy practice, commonly used interventions are local anaesthetic application with vasopressin following by large loop excision of the cervix, cryotherapy, laser ablation or conisation with a knife. To best quantify the benefits of these interventions in the reduction of blood loss and other symptoms, without significant side effects, larger randomised controlled trials are required.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review incorporates evidence from 12 randomised clinical trials which assessed 1512 participants in total. Due to the heterogeneity of the outcomes and treatments considered, there are many single trial analyses and limited consistent data available to compare between trials. The majority of the included trials were underpowered to demonstrate a significant effect and most did not include a power calculation in their methodologies. As the majority of comparisons relied on single trials that were underpowered, the treatment effects should ideally be examined by conducting further studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature and all studies were sifted and data extracted by at least two reviewers independently. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias, i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to meta-analyses of a small number of trials or single trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These are no other systematic reviews in this field and we did not identify any other retrospective controlled studies using these outcomes.</P>
<P>We elected to exclude the two studies that used prophylactic antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foden_x002d_Shroff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foden-Shroff 1998</LINK>) as they included patients that did not have disease. Both these studies did not demonstrate a significant benefit from vaginally administered or oral antibiotics. The other excluded studies evaluated interventions that were not included in the final review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vasopressin administration reduces perioperative bleeding during surgical treatment of CIN (<LINK REF="STD-Sabol-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sabol 1971</LINK>) but a further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>) showed no evidence of the reduction of subjective troublesome bleeding. However, this was a small trial with only 50 participants and seven cases of troublesome bleeding.</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid significantly reduces postoperative blood loss and the incidence of secondary haemorrhage. There are conflicting results regarding the impact of tranexamic acid on primary haemorrhage which is probably a reflection of the low incidence and the small number of women recruited in the trials to date.</P>
<P>Vaginal packing during knife conisation reduces morbidity compared to elective haemostatic sutures. Packs significantly reduced the amount of perioperative blood loss, the risk of dysmenorrhoea, unsatisfactory colposcopy at follow-up and cervical stenosis (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1989</LINK>). There was also a non-statistically significant benefit of vaginal packs in reducing the rates of primary and secondary haemorrhage and amenorrhoea.</P>
<P>The application of cerclage sutures is faster and provides better colposcopic outcomes compared to electrical coagulation (<LINK REF="STD-Dane-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dane 2008</LINK>). Sutures also provide a statistically non-significant benefit in reducing the number of women who have primary and secondary haemorrhages and dysmenorrhoea.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has demonstrated that there should be further RCTs to objectively assess the best interventions to reduce blood loss associated with treatment.</P>
<P>Pragmatically, the majority of treatments are conducted in an out-patient setting and the most common treatment is Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone. This is conducted under local anaesthesia in combination with vasopressin or adrenaline. Ideally, a RCT should be conducted comparing these two vasoconstrictors to evaluate which one is superior.</P>
<P>The RCTs identified provide evidence that the use of tranexamic acid after knife cone biopsy may be beneficial. We would advocate a further trial of sufficient power to establish the precise reduction in postoperative bleeding and secondary haemorrhage, including an assessment by patients if there is a subjective reduction in the volume and duration of symptoms to warrant routine use of tranexamic acid.</P>
