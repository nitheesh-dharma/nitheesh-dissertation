<P>The previous version of this review suggested that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery was more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD at least in the short to medium term and that surgery carries some risk and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>).

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is laparoscopic fundoplication (keyhole surgery which involves wrapping the top end of the stomach around the bottom of the oesophagus (food pipe or gullet) to form a new valve) beneficial or harmful when compared to medical treatment in adults with heartburn or acid regurgitation (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD))?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or GORD is a condition which develops when stomach contents regurgitate into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms such as heartburn (burning sensation at the lower end of the breastbone) or regurgitation (perception of flow of stomach content into the throat or mouth). Long-term complications of GORD include reflux oesophagitis (injury to lining of oesophagus), bleeding from the oesophagus, narrowing of the oesophagus, change in the nature of the lining of the oesophagus which can sometimes give rise to oesophageal cancer. Approximately 3% to 33% of people have GORD around the world. The risk factors for GORD include a family history of reflux disease in immediate relatives, pregnancy, older age, obesity, cigarette smoking, and excessive alcohol drinking. Apart from lifestyle changes (such as cessation of smoking) and diet changes (avoiding food that causes heartburn), the major forms of treatment for GORD are medical and surgical. The medical treatment is usually aimed at decreasing acidity in the stomach. Currently a group of drugs which suppress acid secretion, called proton pump inhibitors, are considered the best in decreasing acid secretion. The main surgical treatment is fundoplication which involves wrapping around the lower part of the food pipe with stomach. This can be performed by traditional open surgery, keyhole surgery or surgery that is performed without making any cut from within the stomach with the help of an endoscope (in this context, a flexible tube introduced through the mouth to give a view of the food pipe and stomach). The benefits and harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to medical treatment in people with GORD is not known. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all studies whose results were reported until 1st October 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, and provided information for the review. A total of 1160 participants received either laparoscopic fundoplication (589 participants) or medical treatment (571 participants). The decision on whether a participant received surgery or medical treatment was made using methods similar to tossing a coin, ensuring that the participants in the two groups were similar. All the trials included people who had had reflux symptoms for at least six months, had received long-term acid suppressive therapy, and could undergo laparoscopic fundoplication if necessary.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of the trials reported long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or GORD-specific quality of life (QoL). The difference between laparoscopic fundoplication and medical treatment was imprecise for overall short-term HRQOL, medium-term HRQOL, medium-term GORD-specific QoL, percentage of people with adverse events, long-term dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), and long-term acid regurgitation. The short-term GORD-specific quality of life was better in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group. However, it was not clear how much this improvement benefited the patient. The proportion of people with serious adverse events, short-term dysphagia, and medium-term dysphagia was higher in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group. The proportion of people with heartburn at short term, medium term, and long term, and those with acid regurgitation at short term and medium term was less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group. The severity of difficulty in swallowing, heartburn, or acid regurgitation was not reported. There is considerable uncertainty in the balance of benefits versus harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to long-term medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Due to the poor quality of the trials, future high-quality studies are needed in this field.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low or very low. As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the results.</P>

<P>There is considerable uncertainty in the balance of benefits versus harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to long-term medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Further RCTs of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical management in patients with GORD should be conducted with outcome-assessor blinding and should include all participants in the analysis. Such trials should include long-term patient-orientated outcomes such as treatment-related adverse events (including severity), quality of life, and also report on the social and economic impact of the adverse events and symptoms.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:59:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or GORD (GERD in North America, as oesophagus is spelt 'esophagus') is a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms or complications or both (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). The symptoms related to GORD are retrosternal burning sensation (heartburn) and regurgitation (perception of flow of refluxed gastric content into the mouth or laryngopharynx) (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). Patients have to determine whether the symptoms are troublesome (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). In general, mild symptoms occurring on two or more days in a week and moderate or severe symptoms occurring on one or more days in a week are considered troublesome by patients (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). The complications include reflux oesophagitis (oesophageal mucosal injury), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, reflux stricture (persistent narrowing of the oesophagus), and Barrett's oesophagus (replacement of the normal stratified squamous epithelium lining of the lower end of oesophagus with simple columnar epithelial lining which is similar to the lining of the stomach) (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>), which in turn is a risk factor for oesophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Solaymani_x002d_Dodaran-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solaymani-Dodaran 2004</LINK>). Other researchers have hypothesised that there is a direct link between symptomatic GORD and oesophageal cancer based on their observation of increased oesophageal cancer irrespective of the presence of Barrett's oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lagergren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagergren 1999</LINK>). While there has been significant controversy over the definition of GORD, the international consensus definition of GORD includes asymptomatic patients with complications, does not stipulate the method of diagnosis, and includes reflux which may be weakly acidic or gaseous (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is global variation in the prevalence of GORD. The prevalence is higher in Europe, North and South America, and the Middle East, with a prevalence ranging between 9% and 33% of adults compared to a prevalence ranging between 3% and 8% in East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Serag-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Serag 2014</LINK>). The incidence of GORD is available from the UK and the USA and is about five cases of GORD per 1000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Serag-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Serag 2014</LINK>). The risk factors for GORD include genetic factors such as a family history of reflux disease in immediate relatives; demographic factors such as pregnancy, older age and obesity; behavioural factors such as cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, drug treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids; and co-morbidities such as abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, gallstone disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest pain, and angina. Coffee consumption, oral contraceptive consumption, and hormonal replacement therapy are associated with lower prevalence of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2005</LINK>). It should be noted that these are associations and no causal association can be shown for many of these factors.</P>
<P>Gastric contents are prevented from entering into the oesophagus by the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). However, LOS relaxes transiently resulting in the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus, even in normal individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014b</LINK>). However, increased reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus and prolonged exposure of the lower oesophagus to gastric contents are believed to contribute to the symptoms and complications of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014b</LINK>). Hiatus hernia lowers the competence and pressure of the LOS, reduces the length of the gastro-oesophageal junction, and alters the opening characteristics of the gastro-oesophageal junction. This results in an increase in the exposure of the oesophagus to acid (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2004</LINK>). Hiatus hernia is associated with severe GORD symptoms and complications (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on the international consensus conference definition, GORD may be diagnosed based on typical symptoms alone (heartburn and regurgitation) without any additional diagnostic tests (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). Diagnostic tests that may be performed to confirm the diagnosis include pH testing, impedence monitoring, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with or without histological examination, or electron microscopy to confirm the presence of one or more of the complications such as reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, and oesophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>). Although a number of classification systems based on endoscopic findings are still commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2008</LINK>), the international consensus conference classifies GORD into oesophageal syndrome (presence of heartburn, regurgitation, upper abdominal pain, chest pain, which may be sometimes be similar to that of anginal chest pain, reflux oesophagitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, stricture, Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus, and oesophageal cancer) and extraoesophageal syndromes (chronic cough, chronic laryngitis, asthma, and dental erosions).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:59:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apart from lifestyle and diet modifications, the major forms of treatment for GORD are surgical and medical treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgical treatment for GORD is in the form of fundoplication. There are various modifications to original complete fundoplication suggested by Nissen, mainly with regards to the amount and area of the gastric fundus which is plicated and where the wrap is fixed (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1998</LINK>). Fundoplication can be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1998</LINK>). Recently endoscopic endoluminal fundoplication, which involves fundoplication without any incision, has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Zacherl-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacherl 2014</LINK>). The complications related to fundoplication include injury to nearby structures such as the liver, spleen, or oesophagus; dysphagia (troublesome difficulty in swallowing) (5%); wrap migration (1%); recurrent regurgitation (1%); recurrent heartburn (1% to 10%); and chest complications (3%) (<LINK REF="REF-Singhal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>). Overall, 1% to 14% of patients undergoing fundoplication develop complications (<LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The medical treatment is usually aimed at decreasing acidity in the stomach (which may be in the form of proton pump inhibitors, H2 (histamine H2 receptor) blockers or H2 receptor antagonists, antacids, prokinetic drugs) and surgical treatment (usually in the form of fundoplication, which can be performed by open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, or by endoscopic endoluminal fundoplication) (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moayyedi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moayyedi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Meer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Meer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zacherl-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacherl 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>For GORD, the medical treatment is usually given orally. Proton pump inhibitors are currently considered the main treatment of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010a</LINK>). Various proton pump inhibitors include omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010a</LINK>). Proton pump inhibitors are generally well tolerated, and adverse effects are relatively infrequent. The adverse effects reported most often with proton pump inhibitors are headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, and rash. Occasionally severe allergic reactions, anaphylactic reactions, muscle weakness, reversible confusional states, mental disturbances, liver failure, kidney damage, and angina have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proton pump inhibitors may be supplemented with H2 blockers such as ranitidine, antacids such as magnesium hydroxide, and prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide or domperidone (<LINK REF="REF-Achem-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achem 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 2014a</LINK>). Adverse reactions to H2 blockers are generally infrequent. The most common adverse effects reported are diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2011</LINK>). The antacids are generally safe. Adverse effects depend upon the antacid taken and the additional ingredients that the antacid preparation contains. The reported adverse effects include constipation, diarrhoea, and flatulence (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2011</LINK>). Adverse effects related to prokinetic agents include extrapyramidal symptoms (usually acute dystonic reactions). Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia have occasionally been reported, usually during prolonged treatment in elderly patients. Metoclopramide may also cause galactorrhoea or related disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2011</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:59:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fundoplication compresses the lower oesophagus, increasing the LOS pressure and decreasing the intermittent relaxations of the LOS (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1998</LINK>). This decreases the amount of gastric acid which reaches the oesophagus. Medical treatments such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 (histamine H2 receptor) blockers work by decreasing the acid secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Achem-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achem 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010a</LINK>). Antacids neutralise the gastric acid (<LINK REF="REF-Achem-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achem 1998</LINK>). Prokinetics improve the gastric motility and hence acid clearance by the oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Achem-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achem 1998</LINK>). </P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-03 11:58:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>GORD is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis in outpatient clinical visits in the USA resulting in more than nine million outpatient visits annually (<LINK REF="REF-Peery-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peery 2012</LINK>). The estimated direct and indirect costs of treatment and lost productivity due to GORD is USD 10 billion annually in US, EUR 9.3 billion annually in Germany, EUR 2.9 billion annually in Italy, and EUR 1.9 billion annually in Spain (<LINK REF="REF-Darba-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darba 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandler 2002</LINK>). There is currently no consensus in the treatment of GORD. The previous Cochrane Review on <I>Medical versus surgical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adults</I> included medical management versus laparoscopic fundoplication surgery and concluded that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery is more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD in the short term to medium term (<LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>). This review is an update of the above review with revised methodology that reflects the current Cochrane methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). This review will provide the best level of evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of laparoscopic versus medical management for GORD, and so allow patients and the healthcare providers involved in their care to make informed decisions.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:59:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have analysed dichotomous data as risk ratio (RR) and continuous data as standardised mean difference (SMD) since different scales were used for measuring the quality of life. We have ensured that higher scores for continuous outcomes have the same meaning for the particular outcome, explained the direction to the reader and reported where the directions were reversed if this was necessary. We have calculated the rate ratio for outcomes such as adverse events and serious adverse events, where it is possible for the same person to develop more than one adverse event (or serious adverse event). If the authors had calculated the rate ratio of adverse events (or serious adverse events) in the intervention versus control based on Poisson regression, we planned to obtain the rate ratio by the Poisson regression method in preference to rate ratio calculated based on the number of adverse events (or serious adverse events) during a certain period. We planned to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event outcomes such as time-to-first adverse event (or serious adverse event).</P>
<P>We have undertaken meta-analyses if this was meaningful, that is if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.</P>
<P>A common way that trialists indicate when they have skewed data is by reporting medians and interquartile ranges. When we encountered this we planned to note that the data is skewed and consider the implication of this.</P>
<P>Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we planned to include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. omeprazole versus laparoscopic fundoplication and lansoprazole versus laparoscopic fundoplication) must be entered into the same meta-analysis, we planned to halve the control group to avoid double counting. The alternative way of including such trials with multiple arms is to pool the results of the omeprazole and lansoprazole and compare it with laparoscopic fundoplication. We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine if the results of the two methods of dealing with multi-arm trials lead to different conclusions.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-11-03 12:10:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>The units of analyses were individual patients with GORD. If cluster-randomised trials were identified, we planned to obtain the effect estimate adjusted for the clustering effect. If this was not available, we planned to perform a sensitivity analysis excluding the trial from the meta-analysis as the variance of the effect estimate unadjusted for cluster effect is less than the actual variance which is adjusted for cluster-effect, giving inappropriately more weight to the cluster RCT in the meta-analysis.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-11-03 12:15:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>We attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors in order to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is identified as abstract only). If we were unable to obtain the information from the investigators or study sponsors, we planned to impute mean from median (i.e. consider median as the mean) and standard deviation from standard error, inter-quartile range, or P values according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>) but planned to assess the impact of including such studies as indicated in a sensitivity analysis. If we were unable to calculate the standard deviation from standard error, inter-quartile range, or P values, we planned to impute standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the remaining trials included in the outcome, fully aware that this method of imputation would decrease the weight of the studies in the meta-analysis of mean difference and shift the effect towards no effect for standardised mean difference.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-04 12:35:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>In this systematic review of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical treatment, we identified four RCTs. There was no evidence of any difference in the overall short-term or medium-term health-related quality of life between the groups. The short-term GORD-specific quality of life was better in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group. However, there was no evidence of any difference in the medium-term GORD-specific quality of life. None of the trials reported long-term overall or GORD-specific quality of life. The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group. There was no evidence of any difference in the proportion of people with overall adverse events between the groups. The proportion of people with dysphagia was greater in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group in the short and medium terms. There was no evidence of any difference in the proportion of people with long-term dysphagia between the groups. The proportion of people with heartburn was less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group at short term, medium term and long term, and the proportion of people with reflux symptoms was also less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group at short term and medium term. There was no evidence of any difference in the proportion of people with long-term reflux symptoms between the groups.</P>
<P>All the studies indicated better GORD-specific quality of life in the short term in the laparoscopic fundoplication group compared to the medical treatment group. Despite using valid scales to measure the GORD-specific quality of life, it is not clear how the difference translates into clinical importance to the patient, such as fewer work days lost or improved social activity. There was no evidence of a difference in the GORD-specific quality of life beyond the short term. There was no evidence of a difference in the health-related quality of life between the groups at any time-point. It is not reasonable to prefer one treatment over another because of the short-lived benefits of laparoscopic fundoplication over medical treatment.</P>
<P>Dysphagia was higher in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group in the short and medium terms. Heartburn and reflux symptoms were less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group in the short and medium terms. Long-term heartburn symptoms were less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group but there was no evidence of a difference in the long-term dysphagia or reflux symptoms. Severity and impact (social and economic) were not reported, so it is difficult to recommend treatments based on these outcomes.</P>
<P>Adverse events and their severity were not reported adequately in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mahon 2005</LINK>). It is important to know the complications related to the two treatment groups and the severity of these complications before the treatment can be recommended. It was not possible to assess this from this systematic review. A review of a US database including 13,050 patients who had undergone laparoscopic fundoplication reported a reoperation rate of approximately 5% at 5 years and 7% at 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2015</LINK>). The majority of these reoperations were 'redo' fundoplications (87% of reoperations) while the remaining 13% of reoperations were reversal of fundoplication (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2015</LINK>). Redo fundoplications are generally carried out for failure of improvement of existing symptoms or new symptoms of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2005</LINK>). Reversal of fundoplication is usually performed because of symptoms such as bloating and dysphagia. A review of a Danish database including 2465 patients who had undergone an open or laparoscopic fundoplication reported a 30-day mortality of 0.46% and a reoperation rate of 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Funch_x002d_Jensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funch-Jensen 2008</LINK>). Thus, the complications of laparoscopic fundoplication cannot be taken lightly. The major adverse events associated with long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment are a modest increase in the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures; an increase in the risk of Clostridium difficile infections in people who are admitted to hospital, from 0.3% to 0.9%; an increase in community-acquired pneumonias; and an increase of approximately 30% in hospital-acquired pneumonias from the baseline rate of 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herzig-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzig 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The choice between surgical and medical treatment is therefore likely to be based on whether people prefer to undergo a procedure that has a risk of mortality of around 0.5% and a reoperation rate of around 5%, or take long-term medical treatment which carries a modest increased risk of fractures, Clostridium difficile infections if admitted to hospital, and pneumonia.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-04 11:18:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>All four studies included in this review compared laparoscopic fundoplication with proton pump inhibitor treatment. The results of this systematic review are therefore only applicable when the choice has to be made between laparoscopic fundoplication and proton pump inhibitor treatment in people for whom laparoscopic fundoplication or long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment is a viable option.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-04 11:23:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>All the trials were considered to be at high risk of bias. While it is impossible to blind participants and healthcare providers who perform the treatment, it is possible to blind outcome assessors. Given that most of the outcomes are subjective outcomes, lack of outcome assessor blinding introduces bias to the effect estimates. Another major source of bias is the post-randomisation drop-out of 20% and 24% in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anvari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Anvari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mahon 2005</LINK>). In another trial, only 60% to 65% of participants were included in the long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2008</LINK>) reflecting the difficulty in long-term follow-up of trial participants. Exclusion of the participants is likely to overestimate the treatment benefits. The proportion of people who underwent surgery and who started taking medical treatment (hence exposing the patients to the risk of long-term medical treatment) was not clear from the trials. There was substantial heterogeneity in some of the outcomes (short-term and medium-term overall health-related quality of life and medium-term GORD-specific quality of life). In the absence of significant heterogeneity in participants and treatment (three trials used laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and one trial used laparoscopic fundoplication according to the surgeon's preference; three trials used a pragmatic approach of medical treatment according to local protocol), the heterogeneity could be because of the instruments used to measure the quality of life. This also introduces additional uncertainty since different validated instruments result in different results. Many of the outcomes had only been reported by one of the included trials. This introduces uncertainty since we can consider that these results were never reproduced. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-08 12:41:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Karin L Dearness">
<P>We took a systematic approach to each stage in the review process, including the search for literature, selection of titles and abstracts for full critical appraisal and data extraction. Two authors independently assessed all studies and disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-11-04 11:24:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>The previous version of this review suggested that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery was more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD at least in the short to medium term, that surgery carries some risk, and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Wileman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wileman 2010</LINK>). Our conclusions have changed with use of current Cochrane Handbook guidelines to interpret the evidence.</P>

<P>There is considerable uncertainty in the balance of benefits versus harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to long-term medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-04 11:25:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>Further RCTs of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical management in patients with GORD should be conducted with outcome-assessor blinding, and should include all participants in the analysis. Such trials should include long-term patient-orientated outcomes such as treatment-related adverse events (including severity), quality of life, and also report on the social and economic impact of the adverse events and symptoms.<BR/>
