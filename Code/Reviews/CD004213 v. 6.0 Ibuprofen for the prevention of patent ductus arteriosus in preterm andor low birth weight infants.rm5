<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-10 16:44:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PDA is a common complication for very preterm (premature) or very small babies. PDA is an open vessel that channels blood from the lungs to the body. It should close after birth, but sometimes remains open because of the baby's premature stage of development. PDA can lead to life-threatening complications. Indomethacin is successful in causing PDA closure, but can cause serious adverse effects. Another option is the drug ibuprofen, which can be given to try and prevent PDA. This updated review of trials found that ibuprofen can prevent PDA, but does not confer any other short-term or long-term benefits.</P>

<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes.

<P>Outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three, need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), renal, pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed and treatment estimates are reported as typical weighted mean difference, relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or number needed to treat to harm (NNH) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-30 16:51:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, seven studies (n = 931) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention are included. Ibuprofen decreased the incidence of PDA on day three [typical RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.46); typical RD -0.27 (95% CI -0.32 to -0.21); NNT 4 (95% CI 3 to 5)], decreased the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and decreased the need for surgical ligation. Results from two studies administering oral ibuprofen had similar results, but showed an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNH 4, 95% CI 2 to 17). In the control group the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day three. Ibuprofen negatively affects renal function. No significant differences in mortality, IVH, chronic lung disease were found.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-30 16:51:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic use of ibuprofen decreased the incidence of PDA, decreased the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and decreased the need for surgical closure. In the control group, the PDA closed spontaneously by day three in 58% of the neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes many infants to a drug that has concerning renal and gastrointestinal side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits and is not recommended. Until long-term follow-up results are published from the trials included in this updated review, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-30 16:49:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-04-03 14:23:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) often complicates the clinical course of preterm infants with or without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Ramanathan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanathan 1997</LINK>). In a large Canadian cohort (n = 3,779) of very-low-birth-weight infants (&lt; 1500 g), the incidence of symptomatic PDA needing treatment was 28% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>). The failure of the ductus arteriosus to constrict after birth is due to lower intrinsic tone, less ductal muscle fibres and fewer subendothelial cushions in the preterm infant as compared to the term infant (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 1995</LINK>). The immature ductus arteriosus has higher sensitivity to the vasodilating effects of prostaglandins and nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 1995</LINK>). This is aggravated by haemodynamic derangements due to respiratory distress syndrome and surfactant therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical consequences of PDA are related to the degree of left to right shunting through the ductus. Despite the ability of the left ventricle in preterm infants to increase its output in face of a left to right shunt, blood flow distribution to vital organs is altered due to drop in diastolic pressure and localized vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 2000</LINK>). Substantial left to right shunting through the ductus may increase the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), and death (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1979</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-30 16:49:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis with non-selective blockers of both cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2 is effective for the non-surgical closure of PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 2000</LINK>). Intravenous indomethacin has become the standard pharmacological treatment for promoting closure of PDA in preterm infants and has been used since 1976 (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1976</LINK>) with a reported efficacy of 66 to 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prophylactic use of indomethacin for the prevention of PDA has been shown to reduce the incidence of a symptomatic PDA, the need for surgical ligation, and the occurrence of pulmonary haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Domanico-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Domanico 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Couser-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couser 1996</LINK>). In a large trial, it was shown that prophylactic use of indomethacin in extremely low birth weight infants reduces the frequency of PDA and severe intraventricular haemorrhage, but there was no evidence of effect on the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at eighteen months (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>). Similarly, a meta analysis of nineteen eligible studies showed that prophylactic indomethacin reduces the incidence of symptomatic PDA, need for surgical ligation, and incidence of grade 3 and 4 IVH in preterm infants, but without evidence of effect on mortality or the incidence of long-term neurosensory impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the use of indomethacin may be followed by side effects such as decreased cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Bel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Bel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1993</LINK>), decreased cerebral blood volume and cerebral oxygen delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2000</LINK>), oliguria or transient renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Betkerur-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betkerur 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2002</LINK>), NEC, isolated bowel perforation or gastrointestinal haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosfeld 1996</LINK>). Concern regarding these complications potentially related to indomethacin use has tempered the enthusiasm for its use, encouraging many researchers to seek new, safer pharmacological strategies for the closure of a PDA. The only major side effect reported in the Cochrane review by Fowlie (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2010</LINK>) was an increased incidence of oliguria, but this was not associated with major renal impairment. In the same review there was no evidence of difference in rates of NEC, excessive clinical bleeding or sepsis.</P>
<P>Other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors have been reported to close a PDA. In Japan, mefenamic acid is frequently used in the treatment of PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Sakhalkar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakhalkar 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ito-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niopas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niopas 1994</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 21:39:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drug, has been used for ductal closure in animals (<LINK REF="REF-Coceani-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coceani 1979</LINK>). Preliminary experimental and clinical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Varvarigou-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Varvarigou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 1997</LINK>) have shown that ibuprofen is effective in closing PDA without reducing cerebral flow (<LINK REF="REF-Mosca-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2000</LINK>) or affecting intestinal (<LINK REF="REF-Speziale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speziale 1999</LINK>), or renal circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Pezzati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzati 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, ibuprofen enhances cerebral blood flow auto regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Chemtob-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chemtob 1990</LINK>) and has been shown to protect neurological functions following an oxidative stress in a piglet model (<LINK REF="REF-Chemtob-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chemtob 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>See: Cochrane Neonatal Review Group search strategy.</P>
<P>MEDLINE database (1966 to December 2010) was searched using MeSH terms: cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, ibuprofen or mefenamic acid, newborn, infant, premature (or preterm) or low birth weight infant, patent ductus arteriosus or PDA. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, December Issue, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to December 2010) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2010), abstracts (American Pediatric Society and European Society for Pediatric Research annual meetings) published in Pediatric Research (1990 to December 2010) or electronically were searched. No new trials since the first publication of this review were identified in the searches undertaken in October 2004 but one trial previously published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Overmeire-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Overmeire 2004</LINK>) and one trial previously published as a letter to the editors (<LINK REF="STD-Gournay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gournay 2004</LINK>) were identified as full publications. The reference lists of identified trials were searched. References lists of published narrative and systematic reviews were reviewed. Web of Science was searched in April 2011 and each of two trials of prophylactic use of ibuprofen published in 2000 were entered to identify other publications that have quoted either of these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Carolis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Carolis 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Contolled-trials.com and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched in December 2010 for any registered trials of ibuprofen for prophylaxis of a PDA.</P>
<P>Unpublished data were not sought, but authors of published trials were contacted to clarify or provide additional information. No language restrictions were applied. The retrieved articles were screened by two review authors (SS, AO) to identify articles eligible for inclusion in the review. No language restrictions were applied. For the previous update in 2009 there was only one review author (AO). For the current update, both authors participated in all steps of the review process and both authors abstracted data from the three most current trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-30 17:26:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of included trials was evaluated independently by the reviewers, using the following criteria:<BR/>Blinding of randomisation?<BR/>Blinding of intervention?<BR/>Blinding of outcome measure assessment?<BR/>Completeness of follow up?</P>
<P>There were three potential answers to these questions - yes, can't tell, no</P>
<P>For the update in 2011, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the risk of selection bias as:</P>
<P>
<I>Random sequence generation</I>
</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided</P>
<UL>
<LI>Performance bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention).</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate personnel aware of group assignment;</P>
<P>Uncelar risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Detection bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods used with regards to detection bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group assignment;</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Attrition bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reporting bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Other bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;</P>
<P>High risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;</P>
<P>Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>For the original review, independent quality assessments were conducted by two review authors (AO, SS), who were not blinded to authors, institution or journal of publication. The updates in 2005, 2007 were conducted by one review author (AO). The current update in 2011 was conducted by both authors (AO, SS).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-05-30 17:01:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The statistical analyses followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. A weighted treatment effect was calculated using the RevMan 5.1 package. The treatment effect estimates included typical relative risk (RR), typical risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes. All estimates of treatment effects were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). </P>

The addition of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>) published since the last version of this review increased the total number enrolled in trials by 62 to 931. All have been published as full text articles. Rubaltelli published an abstract in 1998 which reported an interim analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>. The dose and duration of prophylactic ibuprofen was similar in all the studies, but the age at which ibuprofen was started varied from two to 24 hours in the different studies. In two studies oral ibuprofen was used (<LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>) and in all other studies ibuprofen was administered IV. PDA at 72 hours diagnosed using echocardiographic criteria was reported as an outcome in all studies. Echocardiographic criteria of a significant PDA were similar between the studies. Back-up medical treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin or ibuprofen) was permitted in the presence of significant PDA (after initial trial of ibuprofen, placebo or no medication) in all trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Carolis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Carolis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gournay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gournay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Overmeire-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Overmeire 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>).

The infants were randomised to receive intravenous ibuprofen lysine (10 mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg after 24 and 48 hours) either within 24 hours of life (prophylactic) or after echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA (selective). When PDA was still present after the first course of ibuprofen, a second course was administered. Failure to respond to ibuprofen was an indication for surgical ligation. Primary outcome was incidence of significant PDA as determined by echocardiographic analysis. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed on day three, seven and 21 of life. Other studied variables were ventilatory support, renal function, biochemical and hematological profiles, frequency of CLD at 36 weeks PMA, IVH, NEC, ROP and time to reach full feeds.</P>

Two infants in each group died during the first 24 hours after birth and were not included by the authors in the final analysis. The prophylaxis group (n = 23) received intravenous (iv) treatment with ibuprofen lysine (10 mg/kg) followed by 5 mg/kg after 24 and 48 hours. No placebo was given to the control group (n = 23). In the presence of a significant PDA at the completion of the ibuprofen cycle, treatment with indomethacin (three times 0.2 mg/kg at 12 hourly intervals, administered by iv infusion over 20 minutes) was carried out. The same treatment was administered to infants in the control group who had a significant PDA on day three of life. Failure to respond to medical treatment was an indication for surgical treatment. Primary outcome was incidence of significant PDA as determined by echocardiographic analysis. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed immediately after birth, on day three of life and whenever there was a clinical suspicion of PDA. Other studied variables were ventilatory support, renal function, biochemical and hematological profiles, need for surgical ligation for PDA, frequency of CLD at 28 days, IVH, NEC, ROP and time to reach full feeds.</P>

However, four patients were not randomly assigned because of errors in study drug allocation [three mistakenly received open-label ibuprofen prepared for the curative part of the study during their prophylactic course, and one 10-day-old patient diagnosed with PDA was mistakenly given two doses of the randomised test drug (placebo) instead of curative ibuprofen]. The per protocol analyses were performed on 131 infants. No patient was lost to follow-up. The trial was closed earlier than planned after three episodes of refractory hypoxaemia with pulmonary hypertension happened after the first prophylactic injection in three different centres.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-30 17:16:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update of our review, including one additional study enrolling an additional 62 infants for a total of 931 infants, confirms the findings of the previous versions of this review published in 2003, 2006 and 2009. Study quality varied; only one study reported on the generation of the randomisation sequence, the allocation concealment was unclear in three studies, two studies did not use a placebo, all studies reported outcomes for the infants included in the studies, no study was registered in a trials registry, and one study reported results in abstract form before the study was completed. Several of the estimates of effect size have become more precise due to the increase in sample size. A forest plot for the primary outcome "Presence of PDA on the 3rd day of life (72 hours of treatment) was quite symmetrical around the typical point estimate for RR suggesting that there was no major publication bias favouring studies with larger effect sizes. This review confirmed that prophylactic ibuprofen is effective in reducing the incidence of PDA on day three, reducing the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and reducing the need for surgical ligation of a PDA. It has been shown that the precision and accuracy of clinical and radiological signs in premature infants at risk of patent ductus arteriosus are poor (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1995</LINK>). It is therefore reassuring that the diagnosis of a PDA on day three (72 hours after initiation of treatment) was made using ECHO cardiography in all studies. There was statistically significant between study heterogeneity for the outcomes; need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, NEC, serum creatinine levels after treatment and for gastrointestinal haemorrhage but for no other outcomes. The heterogeneity for the outcome of gastrointestinal bleed disappeared when the one trial that used IV ibuprofen and reported on the outcome was removed from the analysis. The two remaining trials using oral ibuprofen showed a significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal bleed [NNH = 4 (95% CI 2-17)]. This review did not find evidence of a statistically significant difference in mortality, duration of hospitalisation, CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks PMA, duration of mechanical ventilation, IVH, PVL, NEC, intestinal perforation, time to reach full enteral feeds or ROP between ibuprofen and placebo groups. In the 2007 update of the review there was a statistically significant increased risk of proven sepsis between ibuprofen and placebo groups. This outcome was reported only in two trials (n = 201) resulting in wide CIs around the point estimates and no new trial reported on this outcome for the current update. There was a statistically significant increase in the serum creatinine levels on day three of treatment in the prophylactic ibuprofen group as compared to the placebo group. The occurrence of "at least one episode of serum creatinine &gt; 140 micromol/L" was statistically significantly increased. However, there was statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome. The occurrence of oliguria was statistically significantly increased using RR but of borderline statistical significance using RD. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome. In our previous review in 2007, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gournay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gournay 2004</LINK>) reported the occurrence of PH within one hour of administration of ibuprofen to three infants &lt; 27 weeks and &lt; 1000 g. The trial was stopped prematurely after enrolment of 135 infants due to this adverse effect. The authors postulated that this could be due to early administration of ibuprofen (&lt; 6 hours) preventing the normal fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, acidification of their ibuprofen solution (buffered with tromethamine) causing precipitation and micro-embolism in the lungs or due to a specific effect of ibuprofen. This adverse effect was not reported in the two trials included in the 2007 updated review (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>), nor in this update including one more trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>) nor in the trials using ibuprofen for treatment of PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mosca-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 2002</LINK>). Gournay et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gournay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gournay 2004</LINK>) concluded that prophylactic ibuprofen should not be preferred to early curative ibuprofen.</P>
<P>In this update there was a significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with ibuprofen. Three studies reported on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>) and two of the studies used oral ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>). The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was much higher in the two studies that used oral ibuprofen and it may be that gastrointestinal bleeding is specific to the oral formulation of the drug. There was statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome. We therefore undertook a post hoc analysis combining the results only from the two studies using the oral preparation and the heterogeneity was reduced to I2 = 0% for both the RR and the RD.</P>
<P>In the current review, there was a statistically significant increase in the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin or ibuprofen) in the placebo group as compared to prophylactic ibuprofen group. This is an expected event and reflects common clinical practice in the neonatal intensive care units for the management of a symptomatic PDA. In the study by Dani et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>), the infants were randomised to prophylactic ibuprofen or rescue group. In this respect the trial was different from rest of the trials which randomised infants to prophylactic ibuprofen or placebo group. However, the back-up management protocol in five other studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Carolis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Carolis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gournay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gournay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Overmeire-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Overmeire 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangtawesin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sangtawesin 2008</LINK>) and the rescue protocol in the study by Dani et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>) were similar in that each was based on the detection of a significant PDA by echocardiography performed at regular predetermined intervals. Hence, for practical purposes, we considered the rescue ibuprofen group in the study by Dani et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dani 2000</LINK>) to be comparable to the placebo group in other studies as far as management of a PDA is concerned.</P>
<P>In a network meta-analysis of indomethacin versus ibuprofen versus placebo for PDA in preterm infants, Jones and co-workers reported an approximately 30% greater risk of CLD with intravenous ibuprofen given at &gt; 24 hours of life compared to indomethacin or placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011</LINK>). We did not identify an increased risk of CLD with ibuprofen in this updated review nor in the review of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK> ). Their search strategy ended in August 2008 and included fewer studies than in our two ibuprofen reviews for Cochrane.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We did not find any trials comparing prophylactic ibuprofen with prophylactic indomethacin. Prophylactic indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2010</LINK>) has been shown to reduce need for surgical ligation of PDA and grade 3 and 4 IVH. In that review there was no significant effect on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is of note that ibuprofen does not impact on IVH. It is presently unknown whether preventing IVH with the use of indomethacin is preferable to preventing ischemias with the use of ibuprofen.</P>
<P>In the present update of our review, prophylactic ibuprofen was effective in reducing the incidence of PDA, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and the need for surgical ligation, but did not confer any substantial clinical advantages in the short-term. Ibuprofen prophylaxis has a negative effect on kidney function. A new finding in this review was an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with oral ibuprofen. As 58% of the infants in the control group had closed the duct by three days of life, a large proportion of neonates would be exposed to ibuprofen unnecessarily if used as prophylaxis. There are still no long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up studies available.</P>
<P>In 2005 Coceani et al ( <LINK REF="REF-Coceani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coceani 2005</LINK>) proposed that "... an mPGES (membrane bound prostaglandin E synthase) inhibitor, once developed for therapeutic use, could become the agent of choice for PDA treatment, particularly in those instances in which prematurity is complicated by infectious or inflammatory conditions" (<LINK REF="REF-Coceani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coceani 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Prophylactic use of ibuprofen reduces the incidence of PDA, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and surgical closure. However, in the control group, the PDA had closed spontaneously by day three in 58% of the neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefit on outcomes. There was an increase in the serum creatinine levels in the ibuprofen group and in the risk of oliguria. There was a significant increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage with oral ibuprofen. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, grade 3 or 4 IVH, CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks PMA, NEC or time to reach full feeds. The prophylactic use of ibuprofen has been associated with severe PH in one of the trials included in the review but did not occur in the three most recent trials included in this updated review. Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prophylaxis of PDA.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Until long-term follow-up results are published from the trials included in this review no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended. </P>
