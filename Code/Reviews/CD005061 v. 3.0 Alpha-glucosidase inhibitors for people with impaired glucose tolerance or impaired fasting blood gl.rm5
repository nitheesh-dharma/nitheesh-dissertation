<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for people with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting blood glucose</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose) are drugs that delay the breakdown of carbohydrates in the gut, and consequently slow down the absorption of sugars. Patients with type 2 diabetes may use it therapeutically. People with a raised blood glucose level (without being a diabetes patient) may use this drug in order to prevent developing type 2 diabetes and diabetes related morbidity such as cardiovascular diseases. To find evidence for these assumptions, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials of at least one-year duration, investigating alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting blood glucose (IFBG). Patients with IGT or IFBG have raised blood glucose levels, but do not meet the criteria for having type 1 or type 2 diabetes.<BR/>In our review we included five studies, representing 2360 participants, investigating acarbose. Of these studies, one was of high quality, and two did not show exact data, as the results were not available in full publication. The study of high quality yielded that if 10 people with IGT would take acarbose for three years, one case of diabetes would not occur. This finding was confirmed in studies of lower quality. The relevance of this finding is questionable because we found only small effects on blood glucose levels, and the mechanism behind this finding remains unclear: does acarbose really prevent diabetes does it delay the occurrence or mask type 2 diabetes? With respect to the effect on the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, a dubious preventive effect of acarbose on the occurrence of myocardial infarctions was found. However, definitive conclusion could not be drawn and this latter finding should be confirmed in other studies. We found no statistically significant effects on the occurrence of death, other complications related to IGT, or quality of life. Side effects were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin (flatulence, diarrhoea).<BR/>The low number of studies, the poor quality of four of the included studies, and the missing data of two included studies limited this review. First, the missing data of two included studies need to be made available for a future update of this review. Next, the results of the two ongoing studies should be implemented in the review. If, after that, the evidence remains inconclusive, new trials should be initiated in order to investigate the true value of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting blood glucose.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included five trials (2360 participants), all investigating acarbose, that included patients with IGT or patients 'at increased risk for diabetes' (n = 1). Study duration was one, three (n = 2), five and six years. One study was at low risk of bias and four studies at high risk of bias. Except for the outcome incidence of type 2 diabetes in acarbose versus no treatment (two studies), meta-analyses were not possible. Data from the study at low risk of bias suggests that acarbose decreases the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (NNT = 10), cardiovascular events (NNT = 50, based on 47 events, study not initially powered for this outcome), post-load blood glucose (-0.6 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.3) and body mass index (0.3 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI -0.1 to -0.5). No statistically significant effects were observed on mortality, other morbidity, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure. The effects on the incidence of type 2 diabetes were confirmed in two studies at high risk of bias (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6). Adverse effects were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.7 to 4.4).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that acarbose reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes in patients with IGT. However, it is unclear whether this should be seen as prevention, delay or masking of diabetes. Acarbose may prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular events, but this finding needs to be confirmed in more studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:23:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting blood glucose (IFBG) are generally recognised as an expression of abnormal glucose homeostasis that is not severe enough to meet the criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The term IGT was introduced in 1979. In the past IGT has been called a 'pre-state' of diabetes or 'prediabetes' (<LINK REF="REF-NDDG-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDDG 1979</LINK>). The term IFBG (sometimes referred to as impaired fasting glycaemia) has been introduced much later (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>). IGT and IFBG represent different pathophysiological mechanisms: IGT is seen as a characteristic of peripheral insulin resistance and IFBG is seen as an expression of raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion. On the other hand, there are many similarities, as both IGT and IFBG are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and the development of (diabetes related) complications such as cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Unwin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unwin 2002</LINK>). Currently, the criteria for IGT and IFBG are as follows (plasma venous glucose concentrations):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>IGT - fasting blood glucose less than 7.0 mmol/L and two-hour post-load blood glucose 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L;</LI>
<LI>IFBG - fasting blood glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (two-hour post-load blood glucose less than 7.8 mmol/L, if measured) (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). In 2003, the ADA recommended to change these criteria to 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>IGT and IFBG cause no symptoms and the condition should be seen as a risk factor more than a disease itself. It is closely related to other risk factors of type 2 diabetes such as obesity and overweight, unfavourable dietary habits and a shortage of exercise. People with IGT or IFBG are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (even before the onset of diabetes). Thus, the question arises whether an intervention in patients with IGT or IFBG could prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular complications. Life-style interventions consisting of exercise or diet, or both, showed that the incidence of diabetes might be reduced (relative risk reduction) in up to 58% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowler 2002</LINK>). In addition, pharmacological interventions have been investigated in patients with IGT. Especially drugs that claim to intervene with insulin resistance seem appropriate: biguanides (metformin: decreases hepatic glucose output and increases insulin action) (<LINK REF="REF-Knowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowler 2002</LINK>), thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone: increase insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose utilization in muscle and liver) (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2002</LINK>) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (see further).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are reversible inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme present in the brush border of the small intestine. Currently, three AGIs exist: acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. Emiglitate, a fourth AGI, is currently not available on the market. AGIs delay absorption of complex carbohydrates and thus inhibit postprandial glucose peaks and consequently lower postprandial insulin levels. In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, AGIs have been proven to have beneficial effects on glycaemic control and post-load insulin levels but there is no evidence for a reduction of mortality or morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).<BR/>Potential side-effects are of special importance in the use of medication in persons with IGT or IFBG for two reasons. First, IGT and IFBG are asymptomatic, so people will, in contrast to potential side-effects, not notice any direct benefits from the medication. Second, because of the chronic and long-lasting character of IGT and IFBG, medication will have to be used for a long period of time. Therefore, long-term safety is very important. AGIs cause unfavourable dose-dependent side-effects, mostly flatulence and other gastro-intestinal side-effects, when compared to placebo or sulphonylurea. But there is no evidence for long-term detrimental effects of AGIs (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>More recently, AGIs have been put into a new light as a result of a study on the efficacy of acarbose in patients with IGT (<LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2003</LINK>). This study showed that acarbose could prevent or delay the development of IGT into type 2 diabetes. Moreover, it showed a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in the acarbose treated group. However, the conclusions of this study are heavily debated (<LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawicki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawicki 2004</LINK>). We have found no systematic review that focuses exclusively on the efficacy of AGIs for patients with IGT or IFBG.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-30 12:49:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The two reviewers (FVDL and PL) assessed each trial independently. Possible disagreement was resolved with consensus, or with consultation of a third reviewer (EVDL) in case of disagreement. We assessed the following quality items:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of selection bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>randomisation procedure: the randomisation procedure was scored 'adequate' if the resulting sequences were unpredictable (for example computer generated schemes, tables of random numbers, coin tossing).</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment: allocation concealment was scored 'adequate' if participating patients and investigators could not foresee the assignment (for example by central randomisation remote from trial site, sequentially numbered and sealed radio-opaque envelopes).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of performance bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>method of blinding: blinding was scored 'adequate' if the two (or more) drugs / pills were similar in size, colour and shape or when a double-dummy method was applied. Because of the sometimes-obvious adverse effects of AGIs, true blinding is difficult. For trials that reported blinding of patients for medications, we also investigate whether blinding was checked (for example by asking patient and investigator afterwards about the medication they suspected to have been supplied with).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of attrition bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>handling of drop-outs: handling of drop-outs was considered 'adequate' when studies reported a complete description of all patients failing to participate until the end of the trial and if the data were analysed on intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, that means with all randomised patients included.</LI>
<LI>quantity of dropouts: overall dropout rate less than 15% was considered 'adequate'.</LI>
<LI>selective dropout: a difference in dropout rates between the main treatment groups less than 10% was considered 'adequate'.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of detection bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>method of blinding outcome-assessment: outcome assessment was considered 'adequate' if the outcome assessors were completely blind for the intervention. This item was considered less relevant for studies with laboratory data or death as main outcomes.</LI>
<LI>method of blinding of analysis: this was considered 'adequate' if the outcome assessors (investigators, statisticians) were completely blind for the intervention up to the point that all analyses were completed. Blinding of analyses is to date not a common practice in the conduct of randomised trials. Therefore we only planned to explore possible influences of blinded analyses in a sensitivity analysis and we did not plan to use this item for the overall quality assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Following these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories using an adapted version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions criteria: </I>
</P>
<P>A - All quality criteria met (1. adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, 2. adequate blinding, 3. adequate ITT analysis or both drop-out rate less than 15% or selective drop-out less than 10%, or both 4. adequate blinding outcome-assessment): low risk of bias.<BR/>B - One or more quality criteria only partially met (1. inadequate randomisation or inadequate allocation concealment, 2. mentioning of blinding but exact method unclear, 3. inadequate/unclear ITT analysis but drop-out less than 15% or selective drop-out less than 10%, 4. mention of blinding outcome-assessment but exact method unclear): moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - One or more quality criteria not met (1. inadequate randomisation and allocation concealment, 2. inadequate or no blinding, 3. inadequate ITT and drop-out rate equal to or greater than 15% and selective drop-out equal to or greater than 10%, 4. inadequate blinding outcome-assessment): high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis (see under 'sensitivity analyses'). The two reviewers discussed all quality items. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer was planned to be consulted (EVDL).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The table of comparison was divided in all possible comparisons first (for example acarbose versus placebo), then sub-divided into all possible outcomes (for example death, glycated haemoglobin, adverse events) and finally, within the outcome sub-groups were made for the different dosages. Outcomes were calculated per sub-group and for all sub-groups together.<BR/>
<BR/>Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risks (RR). We calculated the risk difference (RD) and we converted the RD into the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) taking into account the time of follow-up.</P>
<P>Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) and an overall WMD was calculated. We used the differences from baseline to endpoint as the actual measure of effect of all continuous variables. The standard deviations of these differences are essential for the data to be included in the meta-analysis. If the standard deviation (SD) of the difference were not reported, we first asked the authors to provide these data. If the SDs were not provided we estimated the SD of the difference with the following formula:</P>
<P>SD<SUB>paireddifference </SUB>= &#8730;[(SD<SUB>1</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP> + (SD<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP> - 2 x r x SD<SUB>1 </SUB>x SD<SUB>2</SUB>].</P>
<P>SD<SUB>paireddifference</SUB> = standard deviation of the difference (pre- / post-treatment)<BR/>SD<SUB>1</SUB> = Standard deviation of the pre-treatment value, SD<SUB>2</SUB> = Standard deviation of the post-treatment value, r = correlation coefficient. We used a conservative correlation coefficient of 0.4.</P>
<P>Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model. Heterogeneity was statistically tested by using the Z score and the &#967;<SUP>2</SUP>- statistic with significance set at P &lt; 0.10. Quantification of the effect of heterogeneity was assessed by means of I<SUP>2</SUP>, ranging from 0% to 100% including its 95% confidence interval (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> demonstrates the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity and was used to judge the consistency of evidence. Possible sources of heterogeneity were (planned to be) assessed by subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses as described below.</P>
<P>The analyses were done with Review Manager (RevMan 4.2).</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:30:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We planned to perform sensitivity analyses for a number of factors by comparing the results of the meta-analysis for studies with and without certain characteristics. Data from a minimum of five studies had to be available for both groups to be considered.</P>
<P>The following factors were planned to be investigated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comparing published and unpublished studies;</LI>
<LI>comparing studies with and without (or with unknown) quality characteristics: adequate randomisation, adequate allocation concealment, adequate method of blinding, adequate ITT analyses, adequate blinding of outcome-assessment (if applicable), adequate method of blinding of analyses. Further, comparing studies with an overall drop-out rate of more than or equal to 15% and less than 15%, differences in drop-out rates less than 10% and more than or equal to 10% between the main treatment groups. In addition, the overall score for quality based on the Cochrane criteria was used (studies with score A and B compared to studies with C);</LI>
<LI>repeating the analyses excluding trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria (patients with IGT or IFBG, or both), language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other or no sponsoring) or country;</LI>
<LI>repeating the analyses using different measures of effect size (relative risk, risk difference) and different statistical models (fixed and random effects models);</LI>
<LI>repeating the analyses excluding large studies or studies with a long duration (based on data) to establish how much they dominate the results;</LI>
<LI>repeating the analyses excluding studies in which other risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes or macrovascular disease were not equally distributed between treatment groups.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Meta-regression analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use meta-regression analyses (in SAS proc MIXED, version 8.0) to explore the influence of characteristics of study population and study design on the outcomes. We planned to examine all dependent variables for which sufficient studies are available; the minimal number of studies would need to be 10 to gain sufficient power. The independent variables were similar to the pre-defined sub-groups. The weight of each trial would be equal to the inverse sum of the within trial variance and the residual between trial variance, in order to perform a random effects analysis.</P>

<P>No significant effects on total mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular causes were found (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>). Data for the other two studies were missing (<LINK REF="STD-DAISI" TYPE="STUDY">DAISI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EDIT" TYPE="STUDY">EDIT</LINK>).<BR/>Acarbose reduced the incidence of (conversion to) type 2 diabetes in the acarbose group: RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.90), Risk difference (RD) 0.09 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.14), Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 10 (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>). The NNT indicates that 10 patients have to be treated for three years with acarbose in order to prevent one case of type 2 diabetes. Also, in the <LINK REF="STD-EDIT" TYPE="STUDY">EDIT</LINK>-study it was reported that the use of acarbose had a preventive effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes: RR 0.66 (P = 0.046).<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study a decreasing effect for acarbose on the incidence of cardiovascular disease as a combined endpoint (myocardial infarction, angina, revascularization procedures, cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events and peripheral vascular disease) was found: RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.86). Also, a decreasing effect on myocardial infarctions (RR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) was found. The RDs were 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; NNT = 50) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.03; NNT = 50) respectively.

In the acarbose and placebo groups 78 and 115 patients developed hypertension respectively (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89). Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg on two visits or if the family physician added antihypertensive medication. It is remarkable that at baseline almost half of all patients were already diagnosed with hypertension (acarbose 357/682, placebo 345/686), but these participants were kept in the analysis for the development of hypertension.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adjustment for high discontinuation rate in the acarbose arm of the STOP-NIDDM study (see appendix 3)</HEADING>
<P>One of the main criticisms on the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study was that the discontinuation rate in the acarbose group was higher than in the placebo group (acarbose 31% versus placebo 19%). Despite the fact that discontinuing patients remained in the ITT analyses, it was suggested that those patients were not followed-up regularly every three months and thus possible occurrence of diabetes or a cardiovascular event was less likely to be discovered (<LINK REF="REF-Sawicki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawicki 2004</LINK>).<BR/>In order to investigate the possible influence of differences in the frequency of follow-up, we re-analysed the data with the following adjustments: first we requested for the mean number of study visits for both treatment groups. Next, we divided the number of visits of the placebo group by the number of visits in the acarbose group. We used this outcome as correction factor for the number of events in the acarbose group (occurrence of cardiovascular morbidity and type 2 diabetes).<BR/>The authors of the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study reported that the mean numbers of study visit in the acarbose (n = 682) and in the placebo group (n = 686) were 13.3 (SD = 5.4) and 14.6 (SD = 4.3) respectively. The calculated correction factor was: 14.6/13.3 = 1.1. The outcomes before and after this correction factor are listed in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. The effects sizes (Odds Ratios) of the outcomes for incidence of type 2 diabetes and occurrence of any cardiovascular disease became smaller after the correction but remained statistically significant. The (statistically significant) effects size for myocardial infarctions did not change (due to the fact that there was only one case in the acarbose group). The other outcomes remained statistically not significant after correction.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:41:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>In this systematic review we found evidence from one large study of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>) that acarbose compared to placebo reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarctions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. These findings could not be confirmed nor refuted by two other (but highly similar) studies because most data were not available thus far (<LINK REF="STD-DAISI" TYPE="STUDY">DAISI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EDIT" TYPE="STUDY">EDIT</LINK>). Two smaller studies of low quality comparing acarbose with no treatment or exercise, confirmed the capacity of acarbose to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Effects on cardiovascular morbidity could not be confirmed in other comparisons. Moreover it should be noted that the effects on cardiovascular morbidity in the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study were based on a limited number of events and the study was not initially powered for this outcome. Compared to placebo, acarbose induces more gastro-intestinal side-effects (NNH = 4).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Decrease in incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>We found evidence from several studies that acarbose reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>). A firm effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes is not surprising. After all, acarbose has a clear effect on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>). Such a drug will have large effects on the 'incidence' of diabetes for people who are at the border of fulfilling the criteria for type 2 diabetes. So, the question is whether acarbose prevents, delays or even masks type 2 diabetes. The authors of the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study are undecided, as they sometimes speak of 'prevention' (in the title) and sometimes of 'delay' (in the summary) (<LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2002</LINK>). Critics of the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study suggested that acarbose masks type 2 diabetes since 15,4% of the patients on acarbose compared to 10,6% (placebo) converted to diabetes during a three months wash-out phase (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2004</LINK>).<BR/>To assess the value of acarbose with respect to the effects on the development of type 2 diabetes, it is probably more straightforward to look at the effects on glycaemic control. After all, IGT refers to an intermediate state between normal glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes. In the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study these effects are disappointing: no significant effect on glycated haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose, and a small effect on post-load blood glucose (-0.61 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.27) were found. Those effects are smaller than obtained in a Cochrane review on alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>). This may be explained by the fact that in the before mentioned review it was found that the effects on glycaemic control were less strong with lower baseline values of glycaemia and longer study duration. Further, most trials in the Cochrane review studied post-load glucose with a full meal tolerance test, and not an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as has been done in the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study. Acarbose has no direct effects on an OGTT as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors only delay the breakdown of complex polysaccharides (and not monosaccharide such as glucose). In this light, the decreasing effect of acarbose on a 2 hours OGTT is positive because it indicates a beneficial effect of insulin resistance.<BR/>Another argument in the question whether an effect of acarbose on the incidence of type 2 diabetes is relevant or important, is the desirability of a drug intervention in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes. It is well recognized that the increase in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes is in life-style factors such as a shortage of exercise and an unhealthy diet. Focussing on drugs as the solution of the problem may distract people from the issues that are truly important: eat less and exercise more.<BR/>Finally the question arises whether true (primary) prevention of type 2 diabetes with a single drug is possible at all. Type 2 diabetes is a very complex disease in which many pathophysiological mechanisms are involved (for example insulin sensitivity, blood pressure regulation). Only when one predominant mechanism would be identified, primary prevention by a drug targeting this mechanism would be feasible. Currently, it seems not likely that this will be the case for type 2 diabetes in the near future. In the mean while, drug interventions for IGT or IFBG should be regarded as secondary or tertiary prevention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Decrease in incidence of cardiovascular disease</HEADING>
<P>The observed beneficial effects on the occurrence of cardiovascular morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>) are very interesting. However, these results should be interpreted with great prudence. This is underlined by the authors who sensibly stated that because effects on cardiovascular morbidity were secondary objectives and the number of events relatively small, they should be seen as hypothesis generating (<LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Critics mentioned the skewed discontinuation rate as another explanation for the observed effects, other than an effect of acarbose (<LINK REF="REF-Sawicki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawicki 2004</LINK>). Because more patients in the acarbose group stopped taking their medication (mostly due to side-effects), the patients in the acarbose group were not followed-up as regular as the patients in the placebo group and could have had therefore less chance to be 'detected' in case a cardiovascular event had taken place. We re-analysed the data accounting for differences in follow-up rate and found that the odds ratios for the occurrence of any cardiovascular event became less strong, but remained statistically significant.<BR/>Another explanation could be in the existence of (unknown) confounding factors. Clues for differences in treatment groups were reported in the cost-effectiveness sub-study of the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> trial (<LINK REF="REF-Quilici-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quilici 2005</LINK>). Baseline risk profiles were determined with a formula for the identification of high risk for type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 2002</LINK>) or cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1991</LINK>). Based on these risk scores, it was stated that '... more placebo patients than acarbose-treated patients were represented in the high-risk subgroups...'. So, patients in the placebo group could have had a higher a-priori risk than patients on acarbose.<BR/>We conclude that the observed effects of acarbose on cardiovascular disease may be due to a treatment effect or to (unknown) confounding factors, or both. The results from the ongoing studies are needed to confirm or refute the observed effects in the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study (<LINK REF="STD-ABC_x002d_Study" TYPE="STUDY">ABC-Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamita-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tamita 2006</LINK>).</P>

Instead we studied the differences in diastolic and systolic blood pressure. These outcomes yielded no statistically significant effects of acarbose compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>), and a detrimental effect of acarbose compared to metformin in one study of low quality and a low number of participants -6 mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 9) (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>One of the main strengths of this review is the rigourness and completeness of the search. It is remarkable that only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK>) was listed in the database that is mostly used by clinicians all over the world (PUBMED), and that the other studies were retrieved from less well-known databases (EMBASE or <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), in databases of ongoing trials or by handsearching. Second, the a priori decision to include randomised trials only with a duration of at least one year ensured a 'minimum level' of quality. Third, we assessed many different outcomes in the review which enables the readers to judge by themselves what matters most for their own particular question. Finally, we think that the tables and figures and the extensive provision of all outcome data and information related to quality and heterogeneity, makes the review transparent.<BR/>It is clear that the main limitations are the missing data, especially from the <LINK REF="STD-EDIT" TYPE="STUDY">EDIT</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DAISI" TYPE="STUDY">DAISI</LINK> studies. The authors have kindly promised their help once their manuscripts are accepted for publication, but it is remarkable that these important studies have not been accepted for publication to date (May 2006). This points to a possible time lag bias: a kind of reporting bias in which studies may be published rapidly or delayed depending on the nature and direction of the results. Of course we will use upcoming data from these studies, and from the studies that are still going on in future updates of our review. Another limitation is the external validity of the results. Only for one study the recruitment of the participants was clearly described. It is important to know how selection took place in order to be able to generalize the results to other clinical settings. For example, were the participants volunteers recruited with an newspaper advertisement (and thus highly motivated), or were they recruited from the files of general practitioners (and maybe less motivated). Further, we only found studies with acarbose as the AGI. The question whether the results may be extrapolated to miglitol or voglibose depends on the existence of a possible group effect for AGIs. The answer to this question is not known, although in the Cochrane review on AGIs for type 2 diabetes comparable results for acarbose and miglitol were obtained for most outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>As far as we are aware of, no systematic review has been done with an exclusive focus on alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for people with IGT of IFBG. Nevertheless, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have been studied as part of a recent systematic review on all kind of drug therapy to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Padwal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padwal 2005</LINK>). In that review two studies on acarbose were included: the <LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_NIDDM" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-NIDDM</LINK> study, and a non-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2001</LINK>) (excluded for the current review). It was concluded that acarbose reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with placebo but that it could not definitively be recommended for diabetes prevention. Similar conclusions were drawn for metformin, troglitazone and orlistat (a weight reducing agent). Further, inconclusive results for a decrease in the incidence of type 2 diabetes were reported for cholesterol lowering agents (fibrates and statins), antihypertensive agents and oestrogens. A systematic review on the efficacy of lifestyle education concluded that lifestyle education was clearly effective for reducing two-hour plasma glucose (0.84 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.29) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes over one year (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.69), and should thus be recommended for patients with patients at high risk for type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Yamaoka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamaoka 2005</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In patients with impaired glucose tolerance the use of acarbose reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes, but the effects on glycaemic control are limited. Acarbose has a possible effect on cardiovascular morbidity, which has to be confirmed in other studies. Life-style interventions remain the cornerstone of treatment for patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. If physicians and patients feel that an active treatment for impaired glucose tolerance is needed, they should consider this evidence together with evidence for other interventions, especially life-style interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>First, the disclosure of the finished - but unpublished - studies is needed in order to confirm or refute the possible effects on cardiovascular morbidity. If the evidence remains inconclusive after these data have been incorporated in the systematic review, the results from two ongoing long-term intervention studies on the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for patients with IGT or IFBG may be awaited. Otherwise, new long-term studies with a similar focus could be initiated.</P>
