The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary (uncontrollable and unintended) movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue, and jaw to convulse, spasm, and grimace. It is caused by prolonged or high-dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat, and can be incurable. The benzodiazepine group of medicines have been suggested as a useful add-on treatment for tardive dyskinesia. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>The review includes four clinical trials with 75 people who had tardive dyskinesia as a result of using antipsychotic medicines. The participants were randomised into groups that received either their usual antipsychotic medicine plus a benzodiazepine or their usual antipsychotic plus a placebo (dummy medicine).</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Improvement in TD symptoms was similar between the treatment groups. Participants were just as likely to leave the studies early from the placebo groups as the benzodiazepine groups. Data were not available for outcomes important to patients such as improvement in social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or quality of life.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Evidence is limited because the trials are so few, small, and poorly reported. It is uncertain whether benzodiazepines are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The use of benzodiazepines for treating people with antipsychotic-induced TD therefore remains experimental, and because they are highly addictive, a last resort. The low number of studies in this review strongly indicates that this is not an active area of research. To fully investigate whether benzodiazepines have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be more well-designed, conducted and reported trials.</P><P>This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (<A HREF="http://mcpin.org/">mcpin.org/</A>).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:32:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:32:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disfiguring movement disorder, often of the orofacial region, frequently caused by using antipsychotic drugs.

For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We synthesised continuous data from valid scales using mean differences (MD). For continuous outcomes, we preferred endpoint data to change data.

Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in TD' (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome 'deterioration of TD symptoms,' we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic-induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under-researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-15 15:33:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The management of schizophrenia and other chronic mental illnesses was revolutionised in the 1950s with the introduction of antipsychotic (or neuroleptic) medications. These medications are effective in the control of symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thoughts (impaired communication), and fixed false beliefs (delusions) (<LINK REF="REF-Donlon-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donlon 1980</LINK>). When used as a maintenance therapy for schizophrenia, antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced risk of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>). However, antipsychotic medications have been associated with a range of adverse effects that can affect quality of life and lead to poor compliance with treatment, such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P><P>TD is a chronic condition of insidious onset, characterised by abnormal, repetitive, and involuntary movements (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). The clinical features include tongue protrusion, side-to-side or rotatory movement of the jaw, lip smacking, puckering and pursing, and rapid eye blinking (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). In some people, rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. In long-term studies, antipsychotic medications have been associated with an incidence of TD of approximately 5% per year in adults and 25% to 30% in elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Correll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2004</LINK>). Studies on the natural history of TD have reported widely variable remission rates (1% to 62%) depending on a person's age, psychiatric diagnosis, course of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P><P>The prevalence of TD is often thought to be decreasing based on the use of second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGA) in place of first-generation antipsychotic drugs (FGA) (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>). One systematic review found that the incidence of TD associated with SGA (2% to 4%) was significantly lower than that for FGA (5% to 8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Correll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2008</LINK>). In older adults, the risk is reported to be more than three times lower when receiving SGA after one year of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2016</LINK>). Despite this, this widespread use of SGA in clinical settings may still result in an overall increase in the number of cases of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000a</LINK>).</P><P>Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain - one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in specific cells of the brain (neurons from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). However, there is some suggestion that the chronic use of antipsychotic drugs may also cause an abnormal production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in turn, could be responsible for the appearance of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cadet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadet 1989</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>After the discovery of chlordiazepoxide in the late 1950s by Leo Sternbach, benzodiazepines became widely available and were prescribed to hundreds of millions of people in various medical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Dell_x0027_Osso-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dell'Osso 2015</LINK>). Their high therapeutic index, the availability of the antagonist flumazenil in case of overdose, and their rapid onset of action make these compounds particularly versatile and difficult to replace in clinical psychiatry. Benzodiazepines are the pharmacological mainstay of the clinical management of anxiety and sleep disorders, but are commonly used as an adjunctive treatment for psychotic disorders and schizophrenia, particularly when people display agitated, violent, and aggressive behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Dell_x0027_Osso-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dell'Osso 2015</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Benzodiazepines have been included as a candidate treatment for TD in several practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardos 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1988</LINK>). It has been suggested that the chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in TD leads to inactivity in another set of cells that employ gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). The benzodiazepine group of drugs are the most widely used GABA agonists and will be the focus of this review. There is limited evidence from animal experiments to suggest that GABA dysfunction is also associated with movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Gunne-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunne 1984</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several SGA have been produced in recent decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does suggest that thoughtful use of older-generation drugs is not associated with more TD than with newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs (such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol) will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and, therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>TD can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>), and symptoms are often irreversible (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerlach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>). Additionally, TD is frequently associated with lower quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ascher_x002d_Svanum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher-Svanum 2008</LINK>) and a greater mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2009</LINK>). Given the high incidence and prevalence of TD among people taking antipsychotic medication, the need for prevention or treatment is clear. Unfortunately, there has been sparse evidence to guide clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2009</LINK>). Although many treatments have been tested, no one intervention has been shown clearly to be effective. Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication is the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many people such a reduction would lead to relapse. This review focused on whether the addition of benzodiazepine treatments to people already receiving antipsychotic medication is likely to help TD.</P><P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) evaluating treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD, and is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 1999</LINK>), and previously updated in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>) and in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Bhoopathi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhoopathi 2006</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To determine the effects of benzodiazepines for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. In contrast, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if endpoint data were not available.

If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggested a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there was suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether their inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, we included these data, because skew was less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI><LI>If a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described in (1) above to take the scale starting point into account.

Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow, and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect.' This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (design effect = 1 + (m - 1) × ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).

If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs available for group means, and either P value or t value available for MDs, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): when only the SE was reported, SDs were calculated by the formula SD = SE × square root (n). Sections 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, CIs, ranges, or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which was based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study's outcome and thus to lose information.

Some trials just present the results of study completers, other trials use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While MMRMs seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. Therefore, we did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches. (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some type of ITT data were not available. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The search</HEADING><P>This area of research does not seem to be active. The 2017 update has identified additional data, but all trials predated 2000. This could be due to a decreased concern with TD, less emergence of the problem in research-active communities because of more thoughtful use of antipsychotic drugs, or loss of faith in benzodiazepines as a potential treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Few data</HEADING><P>Fewer than 100 people have been involved in placebo-controlled trials of benzodiazepines for TD with reported outcome measures. It is possible that real and important effects have not been highlighted because of the necessarily wide CIs of the findings. Many outcomes were not measured (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>). We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of these outcomes in TD trials, but simple reporting of adverse events and social impact/quality of life does not seem too demanding and is of interest to patients and carers.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison 1. Benzodiazepines versus placebo/treatment as usual</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Tardive dyskinesia symptoms</HEADING><P>Results from this review indicated that whether the outcome was no clinically important improvement, not improved at all, or deterioration, there was no compelling evidence that benzodiazepines affect TD between six weeks and six months. However, since evidence was of very low quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), we have very little confidence in the effect estimates and CIs; the true effects are likely to be substantially different.</P><P>In one study, there was some suggestion that the AMS score of people taking clonazepam decreased after eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Xiang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xiang 1997</LINK>). We were not entirely sure that the AMS was a published scale (and therefore meeting our minimal entry criteria), and were unsure what the decline of four points means in terms of clinical signs and symptoms (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). In any event, this finding was taken from one trial involving only 24 people, so should be viewed with caution and not as reliable evidence that clonazepam helps people with TD.</P><P>In another study, measures on the AIMS scale indicated that no treatment reduced TD symptom scores compared with diazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1983</LINK>). Again, these results could not be taken as reliable evidence and should be interpreted with caution, not least because only 13 people were randomised.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse effects</HEADING><P>There was no suggestion that use of benzodiazepines was unacceptable for people with TD, but none of the studies comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or TAU specifically reported on adverse effects.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Mental state</HEADING><P>There was very low quality evidence of no difference between diazepam and no treatment on mental state from one study; therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate and CIs; the true effect is likely to be substantially different.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Leaving the study early</HEADING><P>Two studies reported no events and one study reported that two participants left the intervention group compared with none in the control group.

Completeness</HEADING><P>It is disappointing that so few high-quality data could be extracted from relevant literature. While the evidence from small open studies is crucial in the exploratory phase of psychopharmacological research, confirmatory well-designed, conducted, and reported randomised studies are required to assess the efficacy of an intervention properly. Benzodiazepines for TD are clearly not a very active area of research.</P><P>All four included studies were no more than pilot studies. The total numbers included in these studies was only 15 to 24 (total 75 people). Due to their small size, they cannot really be expected to fully answer any questions about the effects of benzodiazepines for people with TD. Nevertheless, these studies illustrated that trials addressing the effects of benzodiazepines for TD are possible.</P><P>There were no data on the patient-designated important outcomes of social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, neither were there data on hospital and service utilisation outcomes, economic outcomes, behaviour, or cognitive response. Further, there were no data on adverse events for the comparison with placebo or no treatment. It is possible that if used in the medium to long term that benzodiazepines could well have effects in these areas. Benzodiazepines can be sedating, induce tolerance, dependence, and a withdrawal syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2005</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING><P>Trials were a mixture of hospital based and outpatient, and studied people who would be recognisable in everyday care. Benzodiazepines are readily accessible and most outcomes understandable in terms of clinical practice. Should benzodiazepines have had important effects, the findings may well have been applicable.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, the quality of the evidence in this review was very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from the estimates of the effect. We found three main reasons for our low confidence.</P><OL><LI>Poor study methodology and reporting of methods (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) resulting in downgrading evidence for risk of bias.

The largest trial in this review randomised only 24 people. A trial of this size is unable to detect subtle, yet important differences due to benzodiazepines with any confidence. To detect a 20% difference between groups, probably about 150 people are needed in each arm of the study (alpha 0.05, beta 0.8).</LI><LI>Wide CIs (often due to low event rates) that included appreciable benefit or harm for the intervention as well as no effect, resulting in downgrading evidence for imprecision.</LI></OL><P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> for full details.</P><P>The small trial size, along with the poor reporting of trials, would be associated with an exaggeration of effect of the experimental treatment if an effect had been detected (<LINK REF="REF-J_x0171_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">J&#369;ni 2001</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Missing studies</HEADING><P>We made every effort to identify relevant trials. However, these studies were all small and it is likely that we did not identify other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would also not be in favour of the benzodiazepine group. If they had been so, it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible literature. We do not, however, think it likely that we have failed to identify large relevant studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Missing data</HEADING><P>We excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Godwin_x002d_Austen-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Godwin-Austen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thaker 1990</LINK>) that provided no usable data (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>). We contacted the author of one study who replied to confirm that there were no usable data. We could not find up-to-date contact details for authors of the other study. We found it very unlikely that we would receive a reply from authors regarding research conducted so many years ago; therefore, these studies were excluded.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Introducing bias</HEADING><P>This review has now been updated several times. Review authors have tried to be balanced in the appraisal of the evidence but could have inadvertently introduced bias. We welcome comments or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all or had to report data in a different way. We believe the 'Summary of findings' tables are a valuable innovation but problematic to those not 'blind' to the outcome data. It is possible to 'select' significant findings for presentation in this table. We have tried to decrease the chance of doing this by asking a new review author (HB) to select outcomes relevant for this table before becoming familiar with the data.</P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The only other relevant quantitative review we know of are the previous Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bhoopathi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhoopathi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>).

For people with tardive dyskinesia</HEADING><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a difficult condition to treat. The current medication strategy may vary from still taking the original antipsychotic drug at the same dose, reduction of the dose, changing to a newer drug, considering clozapine, or adding additional medications. Should a person with TD be offered adjunctive benzodiazepines, it would be understandable that they would want to weigh any benefits against the risks of taking long-term benzodiazepines, because, as can be seen from this review, trial-based evidence is very limited.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>Today's physicians feel more inclined to reduce the risk of TD by use of newer-generation antipsychotic drugs as they have the reputation of producing fewer adverse effects compared with the older 'typical' drugs. However, there is still uncertainty over just how much reduction in long-term movement disorders the new-generation drugs make possible (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000a</LINK>), as there are some suggestions that the newer drugs are not as free of movement disorders as originally suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Pierre-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierre 2005</LINK>). Older-generation drugs are still widely used in both the high-income and low-income countries, so the incidence of TD is still considerable (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000b</LINK>). Clinicians tend to use benzodiazepines as the last resort for treating TD due to their addictive properties. As for the recipient of care, the clinician who contemplates using benzodiazepines for treating TD is required to balance possible benefits against the potential adverse effects of the treatment. Benzodiazepines are sedating, cause dependence, and, on cessation, a withdrawal syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2005</LINK>). At the moment, based on our results, we have no real evidence that they have any effect in reducing the occurrence of TD. Until there is further evidence, the use of these medications for treating TD should be carefully considered.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policy makers and managers</HEADING><P>It is disheartening to find that in the 17 years since the original version of this review, we have identified only two new relevant studies. Antipsychotic-induced TD remains a common condition of high morbidity and an ongoing source of litigation (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000b</LINK>). The lack of research might be understandable if there had been a breakthrough with other treatments, but this is hardly the case (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 1999</LINK>). Therefore, policy makers are left with few trials and people with this disabling and disfiguring condition will continue to be managed, guided by less than high-grade evidence. There are many possible interventions for TD that have not been adequately subjected to high-quality, large, evaluative studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are used.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING><P>The low yield of studies in this review strongly indicates that this is not an active area of research. Certainly, treatment with benzodiazepines can lead to addiction, which many people would want to avoid and can result in unwelcome litigation. Should anyone be considering a trial for this family of drugs for the effects on TD, with guidance from CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), we would hope that studies would present all methods and numerical data with greater clarity.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Reviews suggested by excluded studies</HEADING><P>As is usual with systematic reviews, there were several studies that had to be excluded but contained comparisons that were in some way related to movement disorders and their treatment. In the case of this review, every one of these trials should have an existing Cochrane Review in which to be considered (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Trials</HEADING><P>We would not recommend benzodiazepines for further trials, before the value of other compounds (such as vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2011</LINK>)) has been fully evaluated. To truly investigate whether benzodiazepines have any positive effects for people with TD, there would have to be well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported RCTs (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Parallel-group, placebo-controlled design is preferable to the cross-over design so commonly seen in this area of evaluative research. Trials should extend for at least six weeks, and, in view of the potential tolerance that can appear with benzodiazepines, should probably last for one year. People entering such a trial should probably do so when other treatments have failed. Benzodiazepines are addictive and cause an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome when stopped. People with mental illness and treatment-induced TD are already disadvantaged without the risk of addiction to benzodiazepines. Sample sizes should be in the hundreds to help avoid false conclusions about the effects of the proposed treatment. Outcomes should be simple and universally clinically meaningful.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 13:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>John McGrath (Queensland, Australia) was author for this review from 1996 to 2002.

The first update (2002) was undertaken by Karla Soares (KSW) and Paul Umbrich (Leeds, UK). The reviewers had a similar protocol for identifying studies and if there was any disagreement, it was discussed and resolved. For the update of 2006, we (Seth Bhoopathi PSB, KSW) applied the following methods.</P><P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>The principal reviewer PSB (Paranthaman Bhoopathi) inspected the citations identified from the search and identified potentially relevant abstracts. KSW (Karla Soares) was contacted and she inspected the citations independently. We discussed and reported any disagreement, and where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once we had obtained the full articles we decided if the studies met the review criteria.</P><P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The categories are defined below:<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).<BR/>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.</P><P>3. Data management</P><P>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>PSB undertook data extraction during the update. All data was discussed with KSJM, the decisions documented and, where necessary, we contacted the study authors to help resolve the issue.</P><P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up (this does not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we considered people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented them separately.</P><P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We also calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). If we found heterogeneity we used a random effects model (see section 5).</P><P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Normally distributed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P><P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation was even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we presented only the endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data were excluded, but we argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Authors of studies reporting only change data are being contacted for endpoint figures. Non-normally distributed data were reported in the 'other data types' tables.</P><P>Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from a finite number (such as zero), the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them.</P><P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes, we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again, if we found heterogeneity (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P><P>4.2.3 Valid scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) is associated with bias; therefore we excluded the results of such scales. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, such data were included but commented on as 'prone to bias'.</P><P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented as well as the general direction of effect.</P><P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then we reported only endpoint data in this review.</P><P>4.2.5 Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems: Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Secondly, RevMan does not currently support meta-analytic pooling of clustered dichotomous data, even when these are correctly analysed by the authors of primary studies, since the 'design effect' (a statistical correction for clustering) cannot be incorporated.</P><P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with an (*) symbol - to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. Subsequent versions of this review will seek to contact first authors of studies to seek intra-class correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for these using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, then we will also present these data in a table. No further secondary analysis (including meta-analytic pooling) will be attempted until there is consensus on the best methods of doing so, and until RevMan, or any other software, allows this. A Cochrane Statistical Methods Workgroup is currently addressing this issue. In the interim, individual studies will be very crudely classified as positive or negative, according to whether a statistically significant result (P &lt; 0.05) was obtained for the outcome in question, using an analytic method that allowed for clustering.</P><P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we used visual inspection of graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted it as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate the data, but the data were presented separately and we investigated the reasons for heterogeneity. The studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials by us, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P><P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1997</LINK>).</P><P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>We analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis.</P><P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for benzodiazepines.</P></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_4" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="4"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="125"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4 studies (5 references) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;18 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;720 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;720 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;704 records identified through database searching&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 additional records identified through searching references of the previously published version of the review&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 records identified through database searching 2017&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;702 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;13 full-text articles excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
