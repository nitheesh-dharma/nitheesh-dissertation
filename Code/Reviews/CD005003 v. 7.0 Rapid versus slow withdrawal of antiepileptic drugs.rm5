<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges of the brain.</P>
<P>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to prevent these seizures. Regular intake of AEDs may have long-term side effects. When in remission, it is logical to attempt to stop the drugs.

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The ideal objective of treating a person with epilepsy is to induce remission by usage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and withdraw the AEDs without causing seizure recurrence. Prolonged usage of AEDs may have long-term side effects. Hence when a person with epilepsy is in remission (free of seizures for some time) it is logical to attempt to discontinue the medication. The timing of withdrawal and the mode of withdrawal arise while contemplating withdrawal of AEDs. This review proposes to examine the evidence for the rate of withdrawal of AEDs (whether rapid or slow tapering) and its effect on recurrence of seizure. This review also examines the effect of variables such as age of seizure onset, seizure types, presence of neurological deficits, mental subnormality, aetiology of epilepsy, type of AED, EEG findings or duration of seizure freedom on the risk of recurrence of seizures with the two tapering regimens. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) To quantify risk of seizure recurrence after rapid (taper period of three months or less) or slow (taper period or more than three months) discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in adults with epilepsy who are in remission. <BR/>(2) To quantify the risk of seizure recurrence after rapid (taper period of three months or less) or slow (taper period of more than three months) discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children with epilepsy who are in remission. <BR/>(3) To attempt to assess which variables modify the risk of seizure recurrence.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2004) and cross-references from identified studies. No language restrictions were imposed. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs in a rapid or slow manner after varying periods of seizure control in patients with epilepsy. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. The outcomes assessed included seizure relapse (i.e. the percentage of patients experiencing seizure recurrence after withdrawal of AED); time to recurrence of seizure following withdrawal; occurrence of status epilepticus; mortality; morbidity due to seizure such as injuries, fractures, aspiration pneumonia; and quality of life (if assessed by validated scale). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial with weak methodology involving 149 children was included with a mean age of seizure onset of four years, mean age of 11 years at the time of starting the taper. The rapid taper group (six weeks) recruited 81 participants and the slow taper group (nine months) included 68 participants, out of whom 11 and 5 were lost to follow up even before the taper began respectively. The number of participants who were seizure free in the rapid and slow taper groups were 40 and 44 respectively at the end of one year follow up (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03); 30 and 29 respectively at the end of two years, (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.53); 24 and 14 respectively at the end of three years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.46); 18 and 8 respectively at the end of four years (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.3); 10 and 6 respectively at the end of five years (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.5 to 4.23). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In view of methodological deficiencies and small sample size, in the solitary study identified, we cannot derive any reliable conclusions regarding the optimal rate of tapering of AEDs. Further studies are needed in adults as well as in children to investigate the rate of withdrawal of AEDs and to study the effects of variables such as seizure types, its aetiology, mental retardation, EEG abnormalities, presence of neurological deficits and other co-morbidities on the rate of tapering. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 17:06:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The ideal objective of treating a person with epilepsy is to induce remission by usage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and withdraw the AEDs without causing seizure recurrence. Some people with epilepsy may prefer to continue to take AEDs lifelong rather than risk a seizure recurrence. However prolonged usage of AEDs may have long-term side effects and may potentially affect the prognosis or quality of life. The adverse effects of AEDs on cognition and behaviour and the social stigma associated with epilepsy are increasingly recognized. When a person with epilepsy is in remission (free of seizures for some time), then it is logical to attempt to discontinue the medication. The rate of recurrence of seizures after withdrawal of AEDs among people with epilepsy who are in remission is estimated to be between 29% to 40% at two years (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>). Thus, the decision to discontinue AEDs depends on the chance of remaining seizure free after drug withdrawal, the presence of factors predictive of higher risks of seizure recurrence, and the medical and social consequence of drug withdrawal compared with continuation of treatment. There are several factors that contribute to the risk of relapse. They are age at onset of seizure; age at treatment withdrawal; family history of epilepsy, recognized aetiology of epilepsy; electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities; number of seizures preceding remission; duration of seizure-free period on treatment; and number of drugs needed to control the epilepsy. </P>
<P>The physician contemplating withdrawal of AEDs is faced with two important questions: timing of withdrawal and mode of withdrawal. The timing of withdrawal (duration of seizure freedom before attempting to withdraw an AED) has not been clearly defined. The American Academy of Neurology drafted guidelines and recommended two to five seizure-free years before withdrawing the drugs (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1994</LINK>). Another study from the UK required the seizure-free period to be at least two years (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>). A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Sirven-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirven 2003</LINK>) found that the pooled relative risk for seizure relapse in early (less than two years) versus late (more than two years) AED withdrawal was 1.32 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.70) (risk difference 0.10; number needed to harm 10), indicating that AED withdrawal in people who are not seizure free for at least two years is associated with a higher recurrence rate. </P>
<P>There is no consensus on the mode of withdrawal. Tapering of antiepileptic drugs ranges from rapid withdrawal to slow withdrawal spread over a period of two years (<LINK REF="REF-Bouma-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oller_x002d_Daurella-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oller-Daurella 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overweg-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overweg 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 1994</LINK>). In very recent studies, the taper period has come down to three to six months, reflecting a change in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Arts-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arts 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul_x002d_Jensen-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul-Jensen 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tennison-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tennison 1994</LINK>) but as yet there is no consensus in this tapering regimen. Risk of seizure relapse due to rapidity of drug discontinuation is not well defined. </P>
<P>We arbitrarily defined rapid tapering as when the AED(s) was/were tapered and discontinued within three months and slow tapering as when the AED(s) was/were tapered and discontinued over more than three months.</P>
<P>In this systematic review we examined whether the rapidity of withdrawal of AEDs among people with epilepsy who are in remission influences the recurrence of seizures and ultimate prognosis or quality of life. We also examined the effect of variables such as age of seizure onset, seizure types, presence of neurological deficits, mental subnormality, aetiology of epilepsy, EEG findings or duration of seizure freedom on the risk of recurrence of seizures with the two tapering regimens. </P>

</B>
<BR/>We contacted authors of identified studies to obtain any missing data. If studies were only in abstract form or published without any clear description of the methodology employed, we contacted the original trialists for clarification. </P>
<P>We assessed clinical and methodological diversity by comparing the distribution of important patient factors between trials (age, seizure type, certainty of diagnosis of epilepsy, duration of epilepsy, number and type of AEDs taken at time of randomization, certainty of seizure recurrence), and trial factors (randomization concealment, blinding, losses to follow up). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> test where a value greater than 50% indicated substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Provided no significant heterogeneity was present, we synthesized data using a fixed-effect model. Where there was a significant heterogeneity we explored the possibility of employing random-effects models. </P>
<P>For time to event outcomes (e.g. time to seizure recurrence), we planned to use aggregate data methods (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>) in the first instance and results were presented as hazards ratios with 95% confidence intervals. If sufficient trials of good quality were found, we considered approaching original trialists for individual patient data, the results of the analysis of would be presented in a subsequent update of this review. For time to seizure recurrence we planned to provide estimates of the risk difference (RD with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) at 6, 12 and 24 months, from which the reciprocal was taken as the estimate of the number needed to harm. For continuous data we calculated weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals. Primary analysis was intention to treat, in which all participants were included in the treatment groups to which they were allocated, irrespective of the treatment or policy they actually received. </P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses on the basis of methodological quality and to test for heterogeneity of the results. If sufficient data were available we undertook subgroup analyses, for example the effect of withdrawal of different antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbitone, benzodiazepine and other AEDs), and if possible meta regression to assess the impact of the following factors upon outcome: age at AED withdrawal; age at seizure onset; AED withdrawn (phenobarbitone or benzodiazepine versus other AEDs); duration of remission; EEG prior to randomization (normal versus abnormal); aetiology of epilepsy (idiopathic/cryptogenic versus symptomatic); neurological deficits (present versus absent).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>One study met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Tennison-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tennison 1994</LINK>). The study recruited 149 children with a mean age of seizure onset of four years, mean age of 11 years at the time of starting the taper. They were seizure free for at least 18 months. The eligible children were randomly assigned to two groups by tosses of coin. The first toss determined the rate of tapering (six weeks or nine months), and the second toss determined whether the taper period would begin after a seizure freedom of two or four years. EEG obtained just before the taper in all the patients, was normal in 40% of them. The six week taper group (rapid taper group) had 81 participants out of whom 11 were lost to follow up before the taper began. The nine months taper group (slow taper group) had 68 participants out of whom five were lost to follow up even before the taper began. Thus the rapid taper group had 70 participants (41 males and 29 females) and the slow taper group had 63 participants (38 males and 25 females). Sixty one participants had more than ten seizures and 84 had partial seizures. The taper period was divided into three equal parts (two weeks each in six weeks taper and three months each in the nine month taper group). The dose was reduced by 25% during each interval. The drugs were tapered sequentially if the participant was receiving more than one drug. Barbiturate was tapered last. Follow up began at the start of drug tapering. All participants were followed up for at least 11 months. Cerebral palsy was present in 43 participants out of the 133, 22 in the rapid taper group and 21 in the slow taper group. Medications used included barbiturate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid. Twenty four participants in the rapid taper group and 25 participants in the slow taper group were receiving two or more drugs. The mean duration of follow up was 39 months (11 to 105 months). </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>This was a quasi randomized study. The randomization was by spin of a coin which is not an ideal method of randomization. The study was unblinded. When more than one drug was withdrawn sequentially, the tapering exceeded the six weeks interval. Out of the 81 in the six weeks taper group, 63 completed the protocol and out of the 68 in the nine months taper group, 48 completed the protocol correctly. Three continued therapy in the rapid taper group and nine continued in the slow taper group without tapering. Eleven participants in the rapid taper group and five in the slow taper group were lost to follow up. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Forty out of 81 in the rapid taper group were seizure free at the end of one year follow up, compared to 44 out of 68 in the slow taper group (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.27 to1.03). At the end of two years, 30 out of 81 in the rapid group and 29 out of 68 in the slow taper group were free of seizures (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.53). After three years of follow up, 24 out of 81 in the rapid taper group and 14 out of the 68 in the slow taper group remained seizure free (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.46). At the end of the fourth year 18 out of 81 in the rapid taper group and 8 out of the 68 in the slow taper group remained seizure free (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.3). At the end of five years of AED withdrawal, 10 out of the 81 in the rapid taper and six out of 68 in the slow taper group remained seizure free (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.5 to 4.23). The results indicate a trend towards a higher recurrence of seizure in the first one or two years after rapid withdrawal of AED, compared to slow withdrawal. At the end of thee, four or five years, there was a trend to higher recurrence in the slow withdrawal group. The presence of mental retardation (95% CI 1.5 to 6.2 (RR 3.1)) and spikes in the EEG at the start of the taper period had higher risk of seizure recurrence (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4). We were unable to get any data regarding other outcome measures such as time to recurrence of seizure following withdrawal, occurrence of status epilepticus, mortality or morbidity or quality of life. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only one study met the inclusion criteria. This study had a weak methodology, since the randomization was by coin toss. The number of participants recruited was small. Even these participants were stratified into four groups. The study was not blinded. Hence the results are prone to bias. Protocol violation and loss to follow up further reduced the reliability of results. When participants were receiving more than one drug, the taper period exceeded the six weeks/nine months taper. This study is probably not powered to detect a significant difference between the rapid and slow taper groups because of the small sample size. Thus we are unable to form any firm conclusions from this solitary study. No data were available for the other outcomes such as status epilepticus, mortality, morbidity and quality of life. We did not find any trials, investigating AED withdrawal in adults.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In view of methodological deficiencies and small sample size, we are unable to derive any firm conclusions regarding the optimal rate of tapering of AEDs. Further trials are needed to assess the optimal rate of tapering of AEDs in adults and children whose seizures are well controlled with medication. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomized control trials are needed to determine the optimal rate of tapering of AEDs in patients in remission. The following questions need to be investigated. </P>
