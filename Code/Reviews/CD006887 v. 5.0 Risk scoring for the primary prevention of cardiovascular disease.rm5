<P>
<I>
<B>Review question</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>What is the evidence about the potential clinical benefits and harms of providing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores in people without a history of heart disease or stroke?</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Background</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of conditions that includes heart disease and stroke. CVD prevention guidelines emphasise the use of risk scores, equations that use clinical variables to estimate the chance of a first heart attack or stroke, to guide treatment decisions in the general population. While there has been much attention to developing different types of CVD risk scores, there is uncertainty about the effects of providing a CVD risk score in clinical practice.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of evaluating CVD risk scores in adults without a history of heart disease or stroke on cardiovascular outcomes, risk factor levels, preventive medication prescribing, and health behaviours.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases for randomised trials (clinical studies that randomly put people into different treatment groups) that systematically provided CVD risk scores or usual care to adults without a history of heart disease or stroke. The evidence is current to March 2016. Funding for the majority of trials came from government sources or pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Key results</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We identified 41 trials that included 194,035 participants. Many of the studies had limitations. Low-quality evidence suggests that providing CVD risk scores had little or no effect on the number of people who develop heart disease or stroke. Providing CVD risk scores may reduce CVD risk factor levels (like cholesterol, blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk) by a small amount and may increase cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering medication prescribing in higher risk people. Providing CVD risk scores may reduce harms, but the results were imprecise.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>There is low-quality evidence to guide the use of CVD risk scores in clinical practice. Studies had multiple limitations and used different methods to provide CVD risk scores. It is likely that further research will influence these results.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 1 2016), Embase (embase.com) (1974 to 15 March 2016), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to 15 March 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registers in March 2016 and handsearched reference lists of primary studies to identify additional reports.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-03-03 08:34:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing the systematic provision of CVD risk scores by a clinician, healthcare professional, or healthcare system compared with usual care (i.e. no systematic provision of CVD risk scores) in adults without CVD.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-07 12:55:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and evaluated study quality. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study limitations. The primary outcomes were: CVD events, change in CVD risk factor levels (total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk), and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included: lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medication prescribing in higher-risk people. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data using 95% confidence intervals. We used a fixed-effects model when heterogeneity (I²) was at least 50% and a random-effects model for substantial heterogeneity (I² &gt; 50%). We evaluated the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-07 12:57:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 41 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 194,035 participants from 6422 reports. We assessed studies as having high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. Low-quality evidence evidence suggests that providing CVD risk scores may have little or no effect on CVD events compared with usual care (5.4% versus 5.3%; RR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 25%; 3 trials, N = 99,070). Providing CVD risk scores may reduce CVD risk factor levels by a small amount compared with usual care. Providing CVD risk scores reduced total cholesterol (MD &#8722;0.10 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.20 to 0.00; I² = 94%; 12 trials, N = 20,437, low-quality evidence), systolic blood pressure (MD &#8722;2.77 mmHg, 95% CI &#8722;4.16 to &#8722;1.38; I² = 93%; 16 trials, N = 32,954, low-quality evidence), and multivariable CVD risk (SMD &#8722;0.21, 95% CI &#8722;0.39 to &#8722;0.02; I² = 94%; 9 trials, N = 9549, low-quality evidence). Providing CVD risk scores may reduce adverse events compared with usual care, but results were imprecise (1.9% versus 2.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.04; I² = 0%; 4 trials, N = 4630, low-quality evidence). Compared with usual care, providing CVD risk scores may increase new or intensified lipid-lowering medications (15.7% versus 10.7%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.87; I² = 40%; 11 trials, N = 14,175, low-quality evidence) and increase new or increased antihypertensive medications (17.2% versus 11.4%; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.11; I² = 53%; 8 trials, N = 13,255, low-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-07 13:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is uncertainty whether current strategies for providing CVD risk scores affect CVD events. Providing CVD risk scores may slightly reduce CVD risk factor levels and may increase preventive medication prescribing in higher-risk people without evidence of harm. There were multiple study limitations in the identified studies and substantial heterogeneity in the interventions, outcomes, and analyses, so readers should interpret results with caution. New models for implementing and evaluating CVD risk scores in adequately powered studies are needed to define the role of applying CVD risk scores in primary CVD prevention.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-07 13:12:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-07 13:04:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes ischaemic heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naghavi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naghavi 2015</LINK>). According to the Global Burden of Disease study, ischaemic heart disease and stroke accounted for 12.9 million deaths worldwide in 2013, or one in every four of the total (<LINK REF="REF-Naghavi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naghavi 2015</LINK>). CVD is also costly, and the World Economic Forum estimates that the direct cost attributable to CVD is USD 863 billion worldwide, with a projected rise of 22% by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of CVD is largely explained by several modifiable risk factors, which include abnormal cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol intake, abdominal obesity, psychosocial stress, and lack of physical activity. These nine modifiable risk factors increase the risk of future CVD events and contribute to an estimated 90% of the population attributable risk fraction of ischaemic heart disease and stroke worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 2004</LINK>). Prevention, treatment, and control of these risk factors before clinical manifestation are therefore primary targets of interventions to reduce the burden of CVD.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-07 13:10:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CVD events are often determined by the confluence of multiple, co-existing risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). The multifactorial nature of CVD has led to the development and application of multivariable risk assessment tools, or CVD risk scores, to calculate CVD risk. CVD risk scores allow clinicians to integrate information from multiple CVD risk factors and quantitatively estimate a person's absolute risk for, or likelihood of experiencing, a CVD event during a defined period of time.</P>
<P>The first widely used multivariable CVD risk score was derived from the Framingham Heart Study in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>). The Framingham risk score incorporated the effects of age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking status, antihypertensive treatment status, and diabetes mellitus to estimate 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. During the past two decades, there has been widespread development of additional CVD risk scores such as the European Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) algorithm (<LINK REF="REF-Conroy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conroy 2003</LINK>); the German Prospective Cardiovascular Munster (PROCAM) model (<LINK REF="REF-Assmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assmann 2002</LINK>); the UK QRISK and QRISK2 equations (<LINK REF="REF-Hippisley_x002d_Cox-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippisley-Cox 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hippisley_x002d_Cox-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippisley-Cox 2008</LINK>); the World Health Organization (WHO) risk chart (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>); the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2013 Pooled Cohort risk equations (<LINK REF="REF-Goff-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goff 2014</LINK>); and the Globorisk cardiovascular risk equation for use globally, including in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Hajifathalian-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajifathalian 2015</LINK>). CVD prevention guidelines recommend use of these risk scores to guide treatment decisions for primary prevention in people who do not yet have clinical manifestations of CVD (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-07 13:12:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current paradigm for CVD risk reduction in primary prevention matches the intensity of prevention efforts to a person's absolute risk for developing CVD (<LINK REF="REF-Bethesda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethesda 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). Risk-based prevention, therefore, directs treatments toward people at increased risk who derive greater benefit from treatment, while sparing people at lower risk for whom benefits may not outweigh the costs and harms of treatment. Qualitative assessment of CVD risk, however, is fraught with error, thereby providing a rationale for quantitative risk assessment tools (<LINK REF="REF-Grover-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grover 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Weijden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Weijden 2008</LINK>). Prevention guidelines in the USA, the UK, Europe, Canada, and the developing world promote the use of multivariable CVD risk scores to guide treatment decisions in primary prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>). The 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines in the USA, described in <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2014</LINK>, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendations for the prevention of CVD in the UK, laid out in <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>, both advocate risk-based prevention strategies that incorporate multivariable CVD risk scores to estimate short- and long-term CVD risk, providing a quantitative framework to guide clinician-patient discussions regarding statins in primary prevention.</P>
<P>Analyses of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) provide empiric support for risk stratification by demonstrating that the absolute risk reduction from preventive medications is related more to the magnitude of pretreatment risk than the relative risk reduction associated with treating a single risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CTT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2005</LINK>). Therefore, use of CVD risk scores not only has the potential to effectively and efficiently direct preventive care to those in greatest need but may help maximise benefit of treatment in high-risk people and minimise harms of over-treatment in people at low risk. Additional purported benefits of CVD risk scores also include raising awareness of disease, improving communication between clinician and patient, and motivating adherence to recommended lifestyle changes or preventive therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Goff-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goff 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>

<P>Although considerable research has focused on the derivation and validation of multivariable CVD risk prediction tools in different populations, the effects of CVD risk scores to direct clinical practice is poorly understood, and few studies have examined their utility in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Damen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damen 2016</LINK>). In 2006 and 2008, two related systematic reviews performed with Cochrane methodology identified only four RCTs testing the clinical effects of CVD risk scores and found no clear evidence that CVD risk assessment improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brindle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindle 2006</LINK>). In 2008, a systematic review examining the clinical benefits or harms of providing CVD risk scores identified six trials showing that physicians presented with risk information tended to appropriately prescribe preventive therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2008</LINK>). Another systematic review examining the effect of giving CVD risk information to adults in clinical practice identified 18 studies (14 RCTs) demonstrating that global CVD risk information improved accuracy of risk perception and increased patients' intent to start pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2010</LINK>). However, in both reviews the effect of CVD risk scores on health outcomes, risk factors, and health behaviours was unclear.</P>
<P>In spite of widespread recommendations for the use of multivariable CVD risk scores in clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>), uncertainty remains about their effects on health-related outcomes. Given the publication of new trials and the continued prominence of multivariable CVD risk scores in primary CVD prevention guidelines, a systematic review of the literature is warranted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions and comparison groups</HEADING>
<P>Interventions varied across trials, which featured different CVD risk scores, risk presentations, and co-interventions (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The two most common CVD risk scores used were the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score (24 trials) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine (6 trials). In these trials, baseline CVD risk was presented as a 5- or 10-year absolute risk of a CVD event. Six trials used risk-adjusted cardiovascular age (called by various names such as heart age, cardiovascular age, or vascular age) in addition to or in lieu of the absolute CVD risk information (<LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grover-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Gonzalez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Gonzalez 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowensteyn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lowensteyn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Peiris 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soureti-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Soureti 2011</LINK>). In addition to the risk message, interventions also included: patient education material (31 trials); clinician- or patient-facing decision-support tools (27 trials); nurse counselling (11 trials); academic detailing/continuing medical education (9 trials); electronic health record integration (10 trials); electronic or paper-based reminders (7 trials); and audit and feedback (4 trials). A few trials implemented only one of these components (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Gonzalez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Gonzalez 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welschen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Welschen 2012</LINK>), while on the opposite side of the spectrum, there were five or more of these components (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoni 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denig-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Denig 2014</LINK>; ; <LINK REF="STD-Koelewijn_x002d_van-Loon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Koelewijn-van Loon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Peiris 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheridan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sheridan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vagholkar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Vagholkar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wister-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wister 2007</LINK>).

<P>Overall and trial-specific assessment of risk of bias are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>. In general, there was high risk of bias across the included studies. Due to the nature of the intervention, few trials were able to blind participants, study personnel, or both. Thus, in our overall risk of bias assessment, we put greater weight on blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) compared to blinding of participants or study personnel (performance bias).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cardiovascular disease events</HEADING>
<P>We identified only three RCTs (N = 99,070) that reported the effects of providing CVD risk scores on CVD events (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Holt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 2014</LINK>). Among participants in the CVD risk score group, there was low-quality evidence suggesting little or no effect on CVD events compared with usual care (5.4% versus 5.3%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 25%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Notably, study authors from two of these trials reported being underpowered for this endpoint because of limited recruitment of participants over the age of 50 and low CVD event rates (<LINK REF="STD-Holt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Holt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 2014</LINK>). The third trial was in a cohort of people with HIV in Switzerland (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2010</LINK>). Due to the unique characteristics and limited generalisability of this cohort, we reanalysed data excluding this study; results were unchanged in direction and magnitude (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cholesterol level</HEADING>
<P>Effects of providing CVD risk scores on cholesterol levels were reported for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. We identified 12 RCTs (N = 20,437) that reported the effects of providing CVD risk scores on total cholesterol and were included in the meta-analysis. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that providing CVD risk scores may slightly reduce total cholesterol levels compared with usual care (MD &#8722;0.10 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.20 to 0.00; I² = 94%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). We also identified 10 RCTs (N = 22,122) that reported on the effects of providing CVD risk scores on LDL cholesterol levels. There was uncertainty about the effect of providing CVD risk scores compared with usual care on LDL cholesterol levels (MD &#8722;0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.10 to 0.04; I² = 84%; low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); the results were imprecise but similar in direction and magnitude to those for total cholesterol. There was substantial heterogeneity for both outcomes that was not explained by a single trial, so these effect estimates should be interpreted with caution. There was no evidence of publication bias by funnel plot for total cholesterol level (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Many of the trials identified in this review reported on achievement of guideline-recommended cholesterol goals after provision of a CVD risk score. However, this outcome was deemed to be unsuitable for meta-analysis due to the marked variation in cholesterol goals from different countries, guidelines, and time periods. One pragmatic clinical trial (N = 435) did not use systematic follow-up procedures after providing CVD risk scores but reported that participants in the CVD risk score group had a greater proportion of repeat LDL cholesterol levels &gt; 30 mg/dL lower than baseline compared with those in the usual care group (22.5% vs. 16.1%, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.41, P &#8201;= &#8201;0.029; <LINK REF="STD-Persell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Persell 2013</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blood pressure level</HEADING>
<P>Trials reported the effects of providing CVD risk scores on blood pressure levels for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or both. We identified low-quality evidence suggesting that providing CVD risk scores may slightly reduce systolic blood pressure compared with usual care (MD &#8722;2.77 mmHg, 95% CI &#8722;4.16 to &#8722;1.38; I² = 93%; 16 trials, N = 32,954; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Similarly, we found low-quality evidence suggesting that providing CVD risk scores may slightly reduce diastolic blood pressure compared with usual care (MD &#8722;1.12 mmHg, 95% CI &#8722;2.11 to &#8722;0.13; I² = 94%; 14 trials, N = 22,378; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity for both outcomes that was not explained by a single trial, so readers should interpret these estimates with caution. There was no evidence of publication bias by funnel plot for systolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Of note, there were two RCTs that reported the effects of providing CVD risk scores on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but we did not pool them because of insufficient data (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanon 2000</LINK>). Neither trial found a difference in blood pressure level between the CVD risk score versus usual care groups.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multivariable CVD risk</HEADING>
<P>In total, 17 RCTs (N = 29,119) reported on the effects of providing CVD risk scores on multivariable CVD risk (a summary measure that incorporated changes in multiple different CVD risk factor levels simultaneously). The scale of this measure varied among studies. Moreover, some studies compared final values between the two treatment groups while others compared change from baseline values. We elected to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change from baseline values for the CVD risk score group and the usual care comparator for our main outcomes. We identified low-quality evidence suggesting that providing CVD risk scores may slightly reduce multivariable CVD risk compared with usual care (SMD &#8722;0.21, 95% CI &#8722;0.39 to &#8722;0.02; I² = 94%; 9 trials, N = 9549; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity that was not explained by a single trial, so readers should interpret these estimates with caution. There was no evidence of publication bias by funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). We also meta-analysed studies that compared final values for multivariable CVD risk estimates between the intervention and comparison groups and observed similar findings (SMD &#8722;0.15, 95% CI &#8722;0.25 to &#8722;0.06; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five trials reported the effects of the intervention on multivariable CVD risk, but we did not pool these in the meta-analyses because of how they reported data (<LINK REF="STD-British-Family-Heart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">British Family Heart 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hetlevik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hetlevik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullig-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zullig 2014</LINK>). One of these trials demonstrated a reduction in multivariable CVD risk with the provision of a CVD risk score (<LINK REF="STD-British-Family-Heart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">British Family Heart 1994</LINK>). This cluster-RCT randomised 12,472 men and women in 13 towns in Britain to a nurse-led screening and counselling programme based on Dundee score (a measure of coronary heart disease risk) or usual care. After one year, the intervention reduced the Dundee risk score by 16.1% (95% CI 10.9% to 21.1%) in men and 15.7% (95% CI 7.4% to 23.3%) in women compared with usual care. The other four studies (N = 6626), however, did not find that provision of a CVD risk score changed multivariable CVD risk (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hetlevik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hetlevik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullig-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zullig 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>There were four RCTs (N = 4630) that reported on adverse events after providing a CVD risk score (<LINK REF="STD-Benner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grover-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2012</LINK>). Definition of adverse events varied between studies and included back pain, headache, cough, upper respiratory infection, musculoskeletal pain, and anxiety. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that providing a CVD risk score may reduce adverse events compared with usual care, but the results were imprecise (1.9% versus 2.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.04; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). There were three RCTs (N = 968) that specifically reported on the effect of the CVD risk scores on anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steenkiste-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steenkiste 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welschen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Welschen 2012</LINK>). Two measured anxiety as a continuous variable and observed that providing CVD risk scores may have little to no effect on anxiety compared with usual care (SMD &#8722;0.07, 95% CI &#8722;0.27 to 0.13; I² = 0%; 2 studies, N = 388; low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). We did not include <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steenkiste-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steenkiste 2007</LINK> in meta-analysis due to insufficient reporting of data but observed no difference in the proportion of anxious participants who received a CVD score versus usual care (16% vs 16%, P value not provided). Lastly, one trial measured psychological distress in middle-aged participants who received a CVD risk assessment (with or without primary care physician follow-up) compared with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2004</LINK>). This trial found no difference in psychological distress at one and five years between participants in the two treatment groups that received a CVD risk assessment compared with those in the usual care group (P = 0.466 at one year and P = 0.579 at five years).</P>

<P>We identified low-quality evidence suggesting that providing CVD risk scores may increase prescriptions for new or intensified lipid-lowering medications in higher risk people compared with usual care (15.7% versus 10.7%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.87; I² = 40%; 11 trials, N = 14,175; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies that was not explained by a single trial, so readers should interpret these estimates with caution.</P>
<P>Four additional studies reported the effects of providing a CVD risk score on lipid-lowering medication prescribing compared with usual care, but we did not include them in the meta-analysis because they did not report sufficient data to determine which higher-risk participants received a lipid-lowering medication (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoni 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cobos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cobos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2010</LINK>). None of these studies reported a change in lipid-lowering medication prescribing. In <LINK REF="STD-Bertoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoni 2009</LINK>, use of a CVD risk score-based decision support tool increased "guideline-concordant lipid-lowering therapy" compared with passive dissemination of an unrelated guideline (9.7%, 95% CI 2.8% to 16.6%), but this was primarily driven by a reduction in inappropriate prescribing in lower risk individuals. Authors reported no difference in appropriate lipid-lowering medication prescribing rates (P = 0.37) (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoni 2009</LINK>). Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Cobos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cobos 2005</LINK>, a computerised decision-support tool that provided a personalised CVD risk score decreased inappropriate statin prescribing (primarily in lower risk individuals) but did not increase guideline-recommended statin prescribing compared with usual care. In <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>, the authors reported no difference in the proportion of participants with CVD risk &gt;15% who were treated with preventive medications between the CVD risk score group and the usual care comparator but formal statistical testing was not presented. Lastly, in <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2010</LINK>, there was no difference in new or increased lipid-lowering medication prescribing in a group of Australian adults randomised to a web-based decision support tool (percent difference &#8722;1.6%, 95% CI &#8722;3.57 to 0.57, P = 0.15), but insufficient data were available to determine risk status of participants who received therapy.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">New or intensified antihypertensive medications</HEADING>
<P>We identified low-quality evidence that providing CVD risk scores may increase new or intensified antihypertensive medications compared with usual care (17.2% versus 11.4%; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.11, I² = 53%; 8 studies, N = 13,255; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies that was not explained by a single trial, so readers should interpret these estimates with caution. We did not pool three studies reporting the effects of providing CVD risk scores on antihypertensive medication prescribing in the meta-analysis because they did not provide sufficient information to determine which high-risk participants were prescribed antihypertensive medications. None of these studies reported a difference in antihypertensive medication prescribing between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">New aspirin prescriptions</HEADING>

We did not pool three additional studies reporting the effect of providing CVD risk scores on aspirin prescribing in the meta-analysis because it was unclear which participants were at higher risk (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>), and the trials did not provide data on primary prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Peiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Peiris 2015</LINK>).

Physical activity outcomes varied by studies and included: self-reported increase in physical activity, number of days exercising &gt; 30 minutes, and proportion meeting physical activity guidelines. Two studies (N = 2595) measured self-reported increase in physical activity, and demonstrated no evidence that providing a CVD risk score had an effect on this outcome compared with usual care (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). The remaining 6 RCTs reported mixed results on physical activity. One RCT of 154 participants reported an increase in the number of days with physical activity &gt; 30 minutes (3.7 days in intervention versus 2.4 days in control; P = 0.002; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 2006</LINK>). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Gonzalez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Gonzalez 2015</LINK> reported an increase in self-reported exercise sessions per week in participants receiving a Framingham risk message compared with usual care: 3.48 sessions (95% CI 3.35 to 3.62) in the Framingham risk message group versus 3.60 sessions (95% CI 3.47 to 3.73) in the usual care group. In <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steenkiste-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steenkiste 2007</LINK>, authors reported an increase in within-group physical activity among participants receiving a CVD risk score compared with usual care, but there were marked baseline imbalances between the two treatment groups and follow-up data were missing from &gt;50% of participants.

Only one RCT (N = 198) used an objective measure of physical activity with an accelerometer and showed no difference in total accelerometer counts between those in the CVD risk score group and those in the usual care group (SMD 0.086, 95% CI &#8722;0.202 to 0.374, P = 0.559; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Hanlon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hanlon 1995</LINK>, self-reported increase in fruit and vegetable consumption (24.3% versus 11.6%, P &lt; 0.001) and self-reported reduction in fat consumption (30.0% versus 9.4%, P &lt; 0.001) was greater in the CVD risk score group compared with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Hanlon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hanlon 1995</LINK>). Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Wister-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wister 2007</LINK> nutritional level (as measured by a 5-point ordinal scale based on the number of recommended food groups met per day)was higher in the CVD risk score group compared with the usual care group (0.30, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.47 versus &#8722;0.05, 95% CI &#8722;0.22 to 0.12; p &lt;0.01; units not provided).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Costs</HEADING>
<P>One trial conducted in Spain reported the effects of providing CVD risk scores on direct costs (<LINK REF="STD-Cobos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cobos 2005</LINK>). Providing a CVD risk score to a clinician decreased overall lipid-lowering medication prescribing rates by decreasing prescriptions in low-risk individuals. The adjusted mean treatment cost per patient was EUR 237 in the usual care group versus EUR 178 in the intervention group, for a difference of EUR 59 (95% CI 34, 83; P &lt; 0.001), a savings of 25% in treatment costs. Similarly, the adjusted means of the total costs per patient were EUR 283 in the usual care group versus EUR 223 in the intervention group, for a difference of EUR 60 (95% CI 33, 86; P = 0.001), a total savings of 21%. A reduction in lipid-lowering medication prescribing rates among low-risk participants was also seen in a quality improvement trial employing a personal digital assistant (PDA) that calculated 10-year coronary heart disease risk (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoni 2009</LINK>); however, investigators performed no formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-British-Family-Heart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">British Family Heart 1994</LINK> did not perform a formal cost-effectiveness analysis, but based on the observed risk factor changes and the projected reduction in coronary events, the authors suggested that the modest improvements did not support broader implementation of the intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis evaluating the effects of providing CVD risk scores on CVD risk factor levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk) by use of clinical decision-support tools to provide CVD risk scores. Results were similar in magnitude and direction, but substantial heterogeneity remained for all analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the substantial heterogeneity observed for CVD risk factor levels, we also performed post hoc subgroup analyses evaluating the effects of providing CVD risk scores by use of health IT and by trials that exclusively enrolled participants with higher risk (defined as 10-year CVD risk &#8805; 10% or a high-risk condition such as diabetes mellitus). For subgroup analyses by use of health IT, results were similar in magnitude and direction, but substantial heterogeneity remained for all analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). In contrast, heterogeneity for the effects of providing CVD risk scores on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was attenuated when including trials that exclusively enrolled higher-risk participants (MD &#8722;0.13 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.22 to &#8722;0.03, I² = 34%; 3 studies, N = 4105 for total cholesterol, <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; and MD &#8722;0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.11 to &#8722;0.03, I² = 0%; 3 studies, N = 14,219 for LDL cholesterol, <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). This attenuation of heterogeneity was not seen for systolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>), diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>), or multivariable CVD risk (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>), which may reflect the greater emphasis on risk-based treatment in cholesterol guidelines compared with blood pressure guidelines.</P>
<P>We did not identify sufficient data to perform subgroup analyses by sex or trial design (RCT versus quasi-RCT). Additionally, after reading study protocols, it was often unclear whether CVD risk scores were provided directly to patients or to clinicians because frequently CVD risk scores were provided to both within the context of a clinical encounter. We did not perform sensitivity analyses because we assessed all studies as being at unclear or high risk of bias.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-03 12:35:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials identified in this systematic review provide low-quality evidence that current strategies for providing CVD risk scores in primary prevention may have little to no effect on CVD events compared with usual care. However, only three studies reported this outcome, and all had limitations. Compared with usual care, providing CVD risk scores may reduce CVD risk factors like cholesterol, blood pressure and multivariable CVD risk by a small amount and may reduce adverse events, but results were imprecise. There was substantial heterogeneity for many analyses, particularly when analysing change in risk factor levels. This was likely a result of: diverse risk levels of the participants recruited for the studies; the multifaceted and varying nature of the interventions tested; different baseline medication treatment rates; and the different outcomes collected. Given this heterogeneity, readers should interpret results with caution.<BR/>
<BR/>Providing CVD risk scores may increase prescriptions for new or intensified lipid-lowering medications, new or intensified antihypertensive medications, and new aspirin therapy in higher-risk people. Further, providing CVD risk scores may increase smoking cessation and may reduce decisional conflict compared with usual care. However, providing CVD risk scores may have little to no effect on medication adherence or health-related quality of life. Measurement of exercise and diet was highly variable among the included studies, and the effects of providing CVD risk scores on these outcomes were mixed. Data on costs were also limited but suggest a reduction in healthcare costs after providing CVD risks scores.

<P>This review provides the most contemporary appraisal of the evidence to date. We identified 73 records of 41 studies (N = 193,614), 8 ongoing studies, and 3 studies awaiting classification. This compares with only four trials (N = 4648) identified in two previous systematic reviews addressing a similar objective and using Cochrane methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Brindle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beswick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 2008</LINK>). We employed broad selection criteria that led to the inclusion of a wide range of trials with different designs, risk levels among participants, and choices of outcomes. CVD risk score interventions also ranged from simple CVD risk score presentations to multifaceted interventions that incorporated different risk messages, clinical decision support tools, electronic reminders, patient activation material, audit and feedback, and nurse-led counselling sessions. These inclusive selection criteria led to substantial heterogeneity in many of our pooled estimates. However, they also enhance the external validity of our findings due to the varied settings, populations, and interventions studied in the trials. Although many CVD prevention guidelines recommend the use of multivariable CVD risk scores to guide primary prevention treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>), we identified multiple evidence gaps to guide the application of CVD risk scores in clinical practice. Trials generally had a short-term focus, had methodological limitations particularly in the domains of attrition bias and detection bias, and were underpowered for clinical endpoints. Given the multifactorial nature of many of the CVD risk score interventions, it is also unclear which component of the intervention was most effective at improving CVD prevention. Thus, there is uncertainty about optimal implementation of CVD risk scores in practice to improve cardiovascular health outcomes.</P>

<P>Using the GRADE framework, we rated the quality of evidence guiding the clinical application of CVD risk scores in primary CVD prevention as low overall. Quality assessments were generally downgraded due to: study limitations across multiple risk of bias domains; inconsistency of results due to the substantial unexplained heterogeneity in pooled estimates; and imprecision. Specifically, we rated the quality of evidence for the effects of providing CVD risk scores on CVD events as low, downgrading due to study limitations and imprecision. We rated the quality of evidence for the effects of providing CVD risk scores on CVD risk factor levels (total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk) as low, downgrading due to study limitations and inconsistency. We rated the quality of evidence for the effects of providing CVD risk scores on adverse events as low, downgrading due to study limitations and imprecision. We rated the quality of evidence for the effects of providing CVD risk scores on new or intensified lipid-lowering medications and antihypertensive medications as low, downgrading due to study limitations and inconsistency.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-03-03 12:41:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review has several strengths. First, we followed a pre-specified, published protocol to guide our systematic review and noted any deviations from this protocol. Second, we conducted a comprehensive, transparent search strategy that was guided by an information specialist (MAB) and that identified published reports, conference abstracts, and clinical trial registers. Third, we included only RCTs or quasi-RCTs that used a systematic method of allocation to the CVD risk score intervention. Fourth, we performed all title screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments in duplicate to minimise bias. Fifth, we used the GRADE framework to rate the quality of evidence and factored this quality assessment to guide our conclusions regarding the effects of providing CVD risk scores.</P>
<P>The principal limitation of this review is the quality of the available data. Nearly all trials (38 out of 41) had high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. Moreover, most trials were powered for process outcomes rather than clinical outcomes, were designed for short duration, did not use systematic follow-up procedures, and delivered CVD risk messages at a single time point only. Trials also varied in terms of design, risk levels of participants, complexity of CVD risk score interventions, content of risk messages, and choice of outcomes. This heterogeneity is demonstrated in the results of our meta-analysis and should temper confidence in our reported effect estimates. This inconsistency is also reflected in our GRADE quality assessments. Our selection criteria of trials with all or &#8805;70% primary prevention participants and where only the intervention group received a multivariable CVD risk score led to the exclusion of several well-known trials that included a majority of participants with established CVD (<LINK REF="STD-Cleveringa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cleveringa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ketola-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ketola 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weymiller-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weymiller 2007</LINK>). Other prominent but excluded trials provided a CVD risk score to both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kullo-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kullo 2016</LINK>). Nevertheless, we feel that our inclusive definition of a CVD risk score intervention and the methods we used to select and evaluate the evidence outweigh these limitations.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-10 03:12:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kunal N Karmali">
<P>Our results are consistent with prior systematic reviews performed on this topic. Two previous systematic reviews performed with Cochrane methodology identified no strong evidence that CVD risk scores improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brindle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindle 2006</LINK>). However, both reviews searched literature through 2004 and only included interventions that provided a CVD risk score to clinicians. Therefore, they identified only four studies (N = 4648). In contrast, our search was performed through March 2016 and included CVD risk score assessment provided directly to patients or performed at the health system level. Consequently, we identified a greater number of trials and were able to provide greater detail about the effects of CVD risk scores on a variety of intermediate outcomes and health behaviours. Other systematic reviews have also highlighted that CVD risk scores can increase patients&#8217; intent to start therapy and physicians&#8217; prescribing of cardiovascular medications with no evidence of harm (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2010</LINK>). However, these reviews did not systematically collect or report effects of CVD risk scores on individual risk factor levels or cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
<P>Our results complement the findings of a recently published non-Cochrane systematic review that evaluated the effect of providing a CVD risk score on clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Usher_x002d_Smith-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usher-Smith 2015</LINK>). This review identified 17 trials (N = 19,036) and reported a small reduction in modelled CVD risk (&#8722;0.39%, 95% CI &#8722;0.71 to &#8722;0.07); a trend toward lower mean total or LDL cholesterol (&#8722;0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI &#8722;0.23 to 0.01); an increase in lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medication prescribing in high-risk participants (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.49 and RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.10, respectively); and mixed effects on smoking cessation, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Notably, this review did not identify evidence that providing CVD risk scores had an effect on blood pressure level (systolic blood pressure: &#8722;0.82 mmHg, 95% CI &#8722;2.70 to 1.05; diastolic blood pressure: &#8722;0.48 mmHg, 95% CI &#8722;1.41 to 0.44). This review, however, has notable limitations. For example, it included non-randomised, before-after studies at high risk of selection bias. Additionally, the authors did not use a systematic framework, such as GRADE, to assess the quality of evidence or guide recommendations. Lastly, the authors used restrictive inclusion criteria that led to the exclusion of many contemporary trials that incorporated CVD risk score interventions within complex, multifaceted interventions. Our review addresses many of these limitations by including only RCTs or quasi-RCTs, using GRADE to assess the quality of evidence, and including trials with multifaceted interventions such as <LINK REF="STD-Peiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Peiris 2015</LINK>, where provision of a CVD risk score was just one component of a larger implementation model. Thus, our review may provide a more comprehensive and generalisable assessment of the current state of the science.</P>

<P>Due to the low-quality evidence available, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the clinical effectiveness of providing CVD risk scores in primary CVD prevention. Providing CVD risk scores may increase lipid-lowering and blood pressure-lowering medication prescribing in higher risk people and may have a small effect on reducing cardiovascular risk factor levels; however, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to determine whether this translates into improved CVD outcomes. For clinical outcomes, not only was there low-quality evidence, but only three studies reported this endpoint. Much uncertainty remains about the optimal implementation of CVD risk scores in clinical practice to improve cardiovascular health outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-03 12:49:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In spite of the widespread promulgation of CVD risk scores in prevention guidelines, there is low-quality evidence and several gaps in evidence for guiding implementation in practice. Given the low event rates in primary prevention, it may not be feasible or practical to conduct a study with a large enough size and duration to determine the effects of providing CVD risk scores on CVD outcomes. Future studies should clearly identify how well the intended CVD risk score application was implemented in practice and evaluate its effectiveness in studies powered to identify reductions in causal risk factor levels. Moreover, studies should identify the optimal content and format of CVD risk messages that motivate behaviour change in physicians and patients, assess the impact of providing CVD risk information longitudinally over time, and look beyond initiation of evidence-based risk-reducing therapies to address uptake and long-term adherence to these therapies to achieve risk factor changes and eventual improvements in health outcomes.</P>

<P>1. For the main outcomes presented in our Abstract, Plain language summary, and 'Summary of findings' table, we prioritised clinical outcomes (CVD events, adverse events), selected CVD risk factor levels (total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk), and commonly prescribed medications for primary CVD prevention (lipid-lowering medications and antihypertensive medications). We included a mixture of these primary and secondary outcomes because we judged these to be of greatest relevance for stakeholders such as patients, clinicians, policy makers, and guideline developers.</P>
<P>2. We modified the secondary outcome of preventive medication prescribing to 'new or intensified medication prescribing in higher risk participants' to capture the anticipated behaviour change from providing a CVD risk score. Similarly, for the smoking outcome, we reported 'smoking cessation,' the desired behaviour change from providing a CVD risk score.</P>
<P>3. We edited the 'objectives' sentence to include main outcomes including risk factor levels and preventive medication prescribing.</P>
<P>4. We had initially planned on analysing all data at the level of the individual using the intra-cluster coefficient (ICC) to generate a cluster design effect. However, few studies reported outcome-specific ICC and estimates varied substantially between trials. After statistical consultation, we meta-analysed data from cluster-RCTs using the reported effect estimate with its 95% confidence interval as long as the authors reported using appropriate statistical analyses (e.g. multilevel model, generalised estimating equations) that accounted for clustering (Chapter 16.3.3 of <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). All 17 cluster-RCTs included in this review reported adjusting for clustering in their analyses.</P>
<P>5. We imputed standard deviations for some trials that reported standard errors or 95% confidence intervals (Chapter 16.1.3 of <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>6. We included two post hoc subgroup analyses to identify reasons for heterogeneity. These included subgroups comparing: trials including high-risk participants only versus trials including all risk levels; and trials incorporating the CVD risk score with health IT versus trials that did not incorporate health IT.</P>
