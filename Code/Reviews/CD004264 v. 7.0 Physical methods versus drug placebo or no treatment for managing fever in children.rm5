<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Health workers recommend bathing, sponging, and other physical methods to treat fever in children and to avoid febrile convulsions. We know little about the most effective methods or how these methods compare with commonly used drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical cooling methods used for managing fever in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register (October 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2005), EMBASE (1988 to October 2005), LILACS (October 2005), CINAHL (1982 to October 2005), Science Citation Index (1981 to October 2005), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing physical methods with a drug placebo or no treatment in children with fever of presumed infectious origin. We included studies where children in both groups were given an antipyretic drug.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:10:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data and the other checked the data for accuracy. Results were expressed as risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for binary outcomes, and mean difference for continuous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:10:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven trials, involving 467 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 30), comparing physical methods with drug placebo, did not demonstrate a difference in the proportion of children without fever by one hour after treatment in a comparison between physical methods alone and drug placebo. In two studies, where all children received an antipyretic drug, physical methods resulted in a higher proportion of children without fever at one hour (n = 125; risk ratio 11.76; 95% confidence interval 3.39 to 40.79). In a third study (n = 130), which only reported mean change in temperature, no difference was detected. Mild adverse events (shivering and goose pimples) were more common in the physical methods group (3 trials; risk ratio 5.09; 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 16.60).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A few small studies demonstrate that tepid sponging helps to reduce fever in children. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physical cooling of people with fever</HEADING>
<P>Fever is a common response of the body to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1992</LINK>). Fever makes people feel unwell and can result in serious complications such as convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Behrmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrmann 2000</LINK>). Febrile convulsions are the most common type of convulsions in childhood and are known to affect about two to five per cent of all children (<LINK REF="REF-Verity-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verity 1985</LINK>). About 30 per cent of those who have had an episode of febrile convulsions will also have additional convulsions (<LINK REF="STD-Stuijvenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stuijvenberg 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physical methods for cooling are often recommended for treating fever (<LINK REF="REF-Axelrod-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelrod 2000</LINK>). The methods most commonly used include tepid sponging, bathing, fanning, and cooling blankets (<LINK REF="STD-Caruso-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Caruso 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Axelrod-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelrod 2000</LINK>). Rubbing alcohol on the skin, cool enemas, and ice packs have also been used for cooling the body during fever, but there are indications that these methods may cause severe adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Senz-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Senz 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steele-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Steele 1970</LINK>). In exceptional cases, doctors may submerge people with extremely high body temperature in cold water to cool them quickly. This is said to be effective in reducing the temperature of people with heat stroke or extremely high body temperature (hyperthermia), conditions under which antipyretic drugs are deemed unsuitable (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Axelrod-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelrod 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physical methods allow the body to lose heat through conduction, convection, or evaporation. Conduction occurs when heat is exchanged between two objects in contact with one another. Convection occurs when warm air in contact with an object moves away and is replaced by cooler air in a continuous cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Ganong-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganong 1989</LINK>). When water evaporates from an object surface heat is lost and the object cools. People who are sponged to treat fever lose heat by all three mechanisms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential benefits and harms of physical and pharmacological methods of cooling</HEADING>
<P>Although the pathophysiology that results in fever are obviously harmful, some experts suggest that fever may have the beneficial effect of enhancing host resistance to infection (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1992</LINK>). Some argue that interventions specifically targeted at resolution of fever may interfere with the beneficial role of fever during illness and consequently adversely affect the outcome of the illness.</P>
<P>Most physical cooling methods are cheap and readily available. Tepid sponging and bathing are widely used by caregivers and doctors to treat children with fever. People believe that these methods are effective and safe (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Eissa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Eissa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crocetti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crocetti 2001</LINK>). However, opinions vary among experts about the actual benefits and harms of physical methods. The common adverse effects of physical methods include shivering, crying, and discomfort</P>
<P>Sponging with cold water may cause peripheral cooling, but the constriction of the blood vessels can actually cause heat conservation (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>). The axillary temperature will fall and the rectal temperature will rise. Tepid sponging has also been reported to cause chills, shivering, constriction of the skin blood vessels, and to conserve heat within the body (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenhardt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lenhardt 1999</LINK>). One of the reasons given for treating fever is to minimize the increased breakdown of the body's energy store, which commonly occurs with fever. However, physical cooling methods have been found to potentially increase the breakdown of body energy and induces shivering (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>). Loss of consciousness in people sponged with alcohol is a rare adverse event that has been associated with this method of treating fever (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arditi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arditi 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events of pharmacological cooling methods are less well known. One trial suggests that treatment with antipyretic drugs could increase mortality in severe infections, prolong viral shedding, and impair antibody response to viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Shann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shann 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of physical and pharmacological methods of cooling</HEADING>
<P>It is unclear whether physical methods are beneficial, especially when compared with commonly used antipyretic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Choonara-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choonara 1992</LINK>). In fact, some researchers have reported that physical methods are less effective than antipyretic drugs at reducing body temperature during fever, and also cause more discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Styrt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Styrt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agbolosu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agbolosu 1997</LINK>). However, most caregivers and many clinicians still believe that treatment of fever will relieve symptoms and prevent harmful effects such as febrile convulsions (<LINK REF="STD-Stuijvenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stuijvenberg 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that physical methods are widely recommended for treating children with fever, we sought to examine reliable research evidence around various physical methods for treating fever in children, and to compare these methods with commonly used antipyretic drugs. This review excludes children with a prior history of febrile convulsions, as this is dealt with elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Offringa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 2003</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:24:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We entered data into Review Manager 4.1. We calculated the risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for binary data and mean difference for continuous data. We assessed heterogeneity using the chi-squared test at the 5% level of statistical significance and by visually examining the forest plot. If we observed heterogeneity, but still considered it appropriate to combine trials, we used a random effects model. We planned to do a subgroup analysis of febrile convulsion for children aged six months to six years since the risk of febrile convulsion is known to be particularly high in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-Behrmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrmann 2000</LINK>).</P>

Four studies did not specify how the allocation sequence was generated (<LINK REF="STD-Steele-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Steele 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hunter-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hunter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mahar 1994</LINK>). Four trials reported adequate allocation concealment (using sealed envelopes); the methods used were unclear in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hunter-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hunter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1990</LINK>); and the remaining study used alternate allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Newman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Newman 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hunter-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hunter 1973</LINK> provided specific information on losses to follow up or withdrawals, while the other trials did not. However, this study had a number of other methodological problems, namely, the trialists stopped randomizing participants to the placebo arm because of failure to show significant response, they did not report the outcomes in this group, and they lost 35% of the sponging group to follow up. <LINK REF="STD-Newman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Newman 1985</LINK> reported that seven of 80 participants (8.8%) allocated to the intervention arm were withdrawn because "they began to shiver", and only 73 participants were analysed in this arm. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review included only seven small trials, all with methodological limitations. Although allocation concealment was adequate in three trials, the method used to generate the sequence of allocation was clear in only one of these. The largest trial used a less robust quasi-randomization technique and resulted in a marked difference in the number of participants allocated to the two treatment arms (80 versus 57); this suggests that randomization failed and any conclusions must be drawn cautiously. Only two trials provided details regarding drop outs or withdrawals, which makes it impossible to rule out attrition bias. One trial had very high dropout rates and post-randomization exclusions. Given these methodological limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>We found insufficient data to demonstrate or refute that physical methods alone are effective in normalizing temperature. However, tepid sponging with paracetamol achieves better antipyretic effects than the drug alone. The outcomes assessed by the available trials varied widely and so pooling of data from different reports was not possible. In addition, the data available are insufficient to explore the effects of water temperature on the cooling effect. None of the trials assessed cooling blankets or fanning. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is limited evidence from three small trials that sponging has an antipyretic effect. This was observed in children who had already been given paracetamol. The intervention also caused shivering and goose pimples. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Physical methods are widely used in treating fever in children, but only a few small trials have evaluated the effects. The small size of these trials makes it difficult to reach conclusions on the possible benefits and harms associated with this common practice. We suggest a study with the following three arms is required: a defined physical method, such as sponging; paracetamol alone; and paracetamol plus sponging. This study should be sufficiently powered to detect clinically important differences in the proportion afebrile by one hour. For example, 30% could be considered a clinically important difference. It would also be helpful to compare warm sponging with tepid sponging, with paracetamol in both arms, in a study with a randomized design. Outcome measures relevant to the caregivers should be explored in qualitative preliminary studies to identify sensible outcomes for a trial. </P>
