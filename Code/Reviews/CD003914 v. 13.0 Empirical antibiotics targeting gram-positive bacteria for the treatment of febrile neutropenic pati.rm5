<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">Spectrum of the initial antibiotic treatment for cancer patients with fever and low leucocytes counts</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:15:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>Background</B>: cancer patients develop neutropenia, a decrease in the subset of leucocytes responsible for protection against bacteria, as a result of chemotherapy or cancer. Neutropenia predisposes the patients to severe bacterial infections. Standard antibiotic regimens for cancer patients with neutropenia and fever are directed at most of the bacteria that can cause infections. However, a subset of resistant bacteria belonging to the gram-positive group (<I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and Streptococci) remain untreated unless specific antibiotics are added to the treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>: we assessed whether the addition of specific anti gram-positive antibiotics prior to identification of a causative bacteria improves survival and cure among cancer patients with fever and neutropenia.</P>
<P>
<B>Search dates</B>: the evidence is current to February 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>: we included randomised controlled trials that compared a standard antibiotic regimen versus the same regimen with an antibiotic directed at gram-positive bacteria. Overall, 14 randomised controlled trials were included with 2782 patients or episodes of infection. The antibiotics were given to cancer patients with neutropenia and fever as first-line treatment (12 trials) or for recurrent fever (two trials).</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>: In 9/14 of the trials the trial received funding from the industry.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>: mortality did not differ between patients groups. Antibiotic treatment was more frequently modified among patients who did not initially receive specific antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria, but overall treatment failures were not different. We attempted to examine the durations of fever and hospital stay, but these were not consistently reported. The addition of specific antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria resulted in more adverse events, mainly rash. We conclude that antibiotic treatment directed against resistant gram-positive bacteria can await identification of specific bacteria and need not be given routinely prior to bacterial identification.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>: overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low but was based on randomised controlled trials, most of which were at low risk of bias. A limitation of the results for mortality was that all-cause mortality was not reported and could not be obtained in 6/14 of the studies. The trials did not examine specific circumstances that might mandate empirical use of antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and thus the evidence is relevant to cancer patients with fever, without low blood pressure, or a focus of infection that might be caused by gram-positive bacteria.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:13:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The pattern of infections among neutropenic patients with cancer has shifted in the last decades to a predominance of gram-positive infections. Some of these gram-positive bacteria are increasingly resistant to beta-lactams and necessitate specific antibiotic treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of empirical anti-gram-positive (antiGP) antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenic patients with cancer in terms of mortality and treatment failure.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For the review update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (May 2012 to 2017), Embase (May 2012 to 2017), LILACS (2012 to 2017), conference proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry, and the references of the included studies. We contacted the first authors of all included and potentially relevant trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one antibiotic regimen versus the same regimen with the addition of an antiGP antibiotic for the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted all data. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A random-effects model was used for all comparisons showing substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%). Outcomes were extracted by intention-to-treat and the analysis was patient-based whenever possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Fourteen trials and 2782 patients or episodes were included. Empirical antiGP antibiotics were tested at the onset of treatment in 12 studies, and for persistent fever in two studies. The antiGP treatment was a glycopeptide in nine trials. Eight studies were assessed in the overall mortality comparison and no significant difference was seen between the comparator arms, RR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.25; 8 studies, 1242 patients; moderate-quality data). Eleven trials assessed failure, including modifications as failures, while seven assessed overall failure disregarding treatment modifications. Failure with modifications was reduced, RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79; 11 studies, 2169 patients; very low-quality data), while overall failure was the same, RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.27; 7 studies, 943 patients; low-quality data). Sensitivity analysis for allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data did not change the results. Failure among patients with gram-positive infections was reduced with antiGP treatment, RR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.84, 5 studies, 175 patients), although, mortality among these patients was not changed.</P>
<P>Data regarding other patient subgroups likely to benefit from antiGP treatment were not available. Glycopeptides did not increase fungal superinfection rates and were associated with a reduction in documented gram-positive superinfections. Resistant colonisation was not documented in the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:14:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Based on very low- or low-quality evidence using the GRADE approach and overall low risk of bias, the current evidence shows that the empirical routine addition of antiGP treatment, namely glycopeptides, does not improve the outcomes of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:16:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Advances in therapy for cancer patients are associated with an increased risk of infection. Newer chemotherapeutic regimens, indwelling intravenous catheters, and bone marrow transplantation for both haematological and solid tumour cancer patients constitute major risk factors for infection. These cause bone marrow suppression with resulting neutropenia and damage to the physiological barriers of infection such as skin and mucous membranes. Infections are the most common cause of death among cancer patients and they are a common rate-limiting factor for continuing cancer therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Nesher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nesher 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gram-negative bacteria were the most common cause for bacteriologically-documented infections when empirical treatment for neutropenic cancer patients was proposed. Eventually, gram-positive bacteria have replaced the gram-negative bacteria as the most commonly documented infection. These include mainly Staphylococci, <I>Streptococcus</I> species, Enterococci and <I>Corynebacterium</I> species. Between 1973 to 1994, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group (EORTC-IATCG) has conducted several multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of empirical therapy in cancer patients with fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-1983" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1996</LINK>). In these trials, the frequency of gram-positive isolates increased steadily from 29% to 69% of single-organism bacteraemias, while the rate of single-agent gram-negative bacteraemias dropped from 71% to 31%. In addition, the overall mortality associated with treated infection has decreased from around 25% to 6% in trials conducted during recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Favero-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Favero 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurwith-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurwith 1978</LINK>). Of late, epidemiology might be reverting to a predominance of gram-negative bacteria, at least in some locations (<LINK REF="REF-Montassier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montassier 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nesher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nesher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yapici-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yapici 2016</LINK>.</P>
<P>Several explanations may underlie the changes in the epidemiology of febrile neutropenia. The increase in infections due to gram-positive bacteria is probably due mainly to the widespread use of centrally placed venous catheters, which have the propensity to be colonised by gram-positive bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Press-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 1984</LINK>). Mucositis induced by intensive chemotherapy is similarly associated with gram-positive bacteria. Quinolone prophylaxis decreases both the incidence of gram-negative and gram-positive infections, but infections occurring despite prophylaxis are more likely to be gram-positive (<LINK REF="REF-Bucaneve-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucaneve 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gafter_x002d_Gvili-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gafter-Gvili 2005</LINK>). The recent resurgence of gram-negative infections might be related to discontinuation of quinolone prophylaxis as a consequence to rising resistance of gram-negative bacteria to quinolones.</P>
<P>Gram-positive bacteria among cancer patients are frequently resistant to the beta-lactams, which are currently recommended for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic cancer patients. Methicillin (an antistaphylococcal penicillin)-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) is common in the healthcare setting, with methicillin-resistance rates reaching up to 50% of all <I>S. aureus</I> isolates in high-endemicity locations in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-EARS_x002d_NET" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARS-NET</LINK>). However, the observed prevalence of MRSA has stabilised or declined in the last decade worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Akova-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akova 2016</LINK>). This reduction has been assumed to result from improved infection control. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are commonly responsible for bloodstream infections in cancer patients and resistance rates of 90% for methicillin, 68.4% for ciprofloxacin, and 48.5% for clindamycin have been reported in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-May-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in febrile neutropenic patients advise against routine empirical treatment with glycopeptides, prior to identification of the causative pathogen or its susceptibilities (<LINK REF="REF-Averbuch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Averbuch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cometta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cometta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penack-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penack 2011</LINK>). Exceptions are defined in patients with hypotension, severe sepsis and septic shock, and those with severe mucositis. Pre-emptive treatment is advised for patients with suspected catheter-related infections (with clinical signs of catheter infection). European guidelines recommend the consideration of empirical glycopeptides in centres where resistant gram-positive bacteria (that is methicillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I> or penicillin-resistant streptococci) are predominant (<LINK REF="REF-Cometta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cometta 2007</LINK>). Targeted treatments are recommended for patients with documented infections caused by beta-lactam resistant gram-positive bacteria, and for those with bacteraemia caused by gram-positive bacteria, prior to final identification of the pathogen and susceptibility testing (<LINK REF="REF-Averbuch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Averbuch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Withholding broad-spectrum anti-gram-positive (antiGP) treatment is not necessarily detrimental and may even be advantageous. Early empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenic patients was suggested when gram-negative organisms dominated. Such early treatment reduced mortality since gram-negative infections are notoriously rapidly fatal. Infections due to gram-positive bacteria, especially those caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, may be less rapidly fatal permitting initiation of specific antibiotic treatment when an infection is documented (<LINK REF="REF-Rosa-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosa 2014</LINK>). Administration of glycopeptides may be associated with adverse effects, especially when combined with aminoglycosides or other nephrotoxic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 2005</LINK>). Moreover, use of glycopeptides has been associated with emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and <I>S. aureus</I> resistant to glycopeptides (<LINK REF="REF-Montecalvo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montecalvo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sievert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sievert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tenover-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenover 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering an overall mortality rate among patients with febrile neutropenia of around 6%, the sample size needed to assess the effect of antiGP treatment is large (<LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>). We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of trials comparing the treatment for febrile neutropenia with or without specific antiGP coverage. We looked for specific patient subgroups for whom antiGP treatment may be specifically indicated.</P>

<P>We included 22 publications representing 14 individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) corresponding to our inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted between 1979 and 2014.</P>
<P>Glycopeptides were tested in nine trials (vancomycin five, teicoplanin four) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). These trials were performed between 1984 and 2000. Other anti-gram-positive (antiGP) drugs were tested in five trials: cephalothin in two (<LINK REF="STD-Lawson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lawson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhagen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Verhagen 1987</LINK>), flucloxacillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole in one trial each (<LINK REF="STD-de-Pauw-1985" TYPE="STUDY">de Pauw 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menichetti-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Menichetti 1986</LINK>, respectively), and tigecycline in the last trial identified in the 2017 update (<LINK REF="STD-Bucaneve-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bucaneve 2014</LINK>). The last two antiGP antibiotics cover also gram-negative bacteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bucaneve-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bucaneve 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menichetti-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Menichetti 1986</LINK>). The basic antibiotic regimens are specified in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. Ceftazidime, the most commonly used beta-lactam used as a basic regimen, was used alone in five trials and with amikacin in two trials.</P>
<P>The antiGP antibiotic was tested at the onset of antibiotic treatment as the first line (empirical) regimen in all trials but two, which assessed its addition for persistently febrile patients (first modification) after 72 to 96 hours of imipenem monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 2000</LINK>), or after 48 to 60 hours of piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Cometta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cometta 2003</LINK>). We did not identify studies assessing pre-emptive antiGP treatment.</P>
<P>Nine trials randomised 1993 patients. Five studies allowed patient re-entry for separate neutropenic febrile episodes, thus randomising episodes instead of patients. Three trials included 352 episodes representing 292 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Favero-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Del Favero 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menichetti-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Menichetti 1986</LINK>), and two trials included 437 episodes without specifying the number of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lawson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lawson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marie-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marie 1991</LINK>). Overall, 2782 febrile episodes were included and 2549 were evaluated.</P>
<P>All trials included patients with haematological malignancies, except for one trial that was restricted to patients with solid tumours (<LINK REF="STD-Molina-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Molina 1993</LINK>). One trial included only patients with haematological malignancies (<LINK REF="STD-Bucaneve-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bucaneve 2014</LINK>). Two trials did not specify patients' age. In the remaining trials, children less than 16 years were included in six trials, and the mean age ranged between 38 to 48 years. With regard to exclusion of patients at risk for infections due to gram-positive bacteria, the two first modification trials excluded patients with documented or suspected catheter-related infections (<LINK REF="STD-Cometta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cometta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 2000</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies, including 1242 participants, reported overall mortality. The adjusted mean mortality rate in these studies was 9.0%. The risk ratio (RR) for death was 0.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.25; 8 studies, 1242 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), values lower than 1 favouring the antiGP arm. The quality of this evidence was rated as moderate, downgraded for imprecision (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Two trials used a glycopeptide empirically, two used a glycopeptide semi-empirically, and four used another antiGP antibiotic empirically. No difference in mortality was seen in each of these groups. Considering only studies with low-risk allocation concealment, or those reporting mortality by ITT results, the results were similar, below 1 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Overall, no heterogeneity was seen with this comparison, which was performed using the fixed-effect model (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>Data regarding mortality among patient subgroups were scarce. Only five studies were included in the comparison for patients in whom a gram-positive infection was documented (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Only 13 deaths were recorded; hence although overall mortality among patients receiving antiGP treatment was almost twice that in the control group, this was not interpreted into a difference. The rate of single-agent gram-positive bacteraemia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) was reported only for five of the studies in the mortality analysis and no association was observed between this rate and the RRs for mortality, but the analysis was limited by the paucity of data with extreme 95% CI for the ratio of odds ratios (ORs). Excluding two studies in which the antiGP was active also against gram-negative bacteria did not change results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Data for the other pre-defined subgroup analyses were not available. Inspecting the funnel plot did not reveal a small-study effect (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eight trials compared infection-related fatality, two of which did not report overall mortality. The RR was 1.15 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.75; 8 studies, 1810 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment failure</HEADING>
<P>Overall failure, disregarding treatment modifications, was assessed in seven studies including 943 participants and was similar in both study arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.27; 7 studies, 943 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, low-quality evidence). When modifications were counted as causes for treatment failure, an advantage in favour of antiGP treatment was evident (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.79, 11 studies, 2169 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, very low-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence for failure was downgraded for lack of blinding for both outcomes and indirectness of the outcome for treatment failure with modifications (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The advantage originated from studies that assessed the initial empirical administration of antiGP antibiotics and was demonstrated both for empirical glycopeptides and other antiGP agents. No benefit was observed for the addition of glycopeptides for persistent fever (first modification), in two double-blind studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cometta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cometta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).

<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Excluding the double-blind trials decreased the risk ratio (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.75), demonstrating the effect of the open design on treatment modifications. The funnel plot for failure was centred approximately symmetrically around the effect estimate (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses of failure with modifications, when excluding antiGP antibiotics covering gram-negative bacteria, there was no longer an advantage to non-glycopeptide empirical antiGP antibiotics (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). An analysis restricted to patients who ultimately had a gram-positive infection, was composed of studies assessing empirical antiGP treatment and demonstrated a large advantage to this intervention, (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84; 5 studies, 175 patients; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Meta-regression demonstrated no association between the rate of single gram-positive bacteraemia in the studies and their risk ratio for failure with antiGP treatment. No data were available for the subgroup of patients with central catheters or those having received quinolone prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Duration of fever was not reported comparatively, but three studies compared the number of persistently febrile patients at 72 hours after the initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>). An advantage to the antiGP arm was seen, but the number of patients evaluated was small (312 patients). Amphotericin was added more frequently to the control arm (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.80, 5 studies, 1201 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). Substantial heterogeneity was seen in the comparisons of persistent fever and addition of amphotericin, which were analysed using the random-effects model.</P>

<P>AntiGP treatment did not increase superinfection rates (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

The rate of fungal superinfections was similar in both arms (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.82, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:22:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We show that the current evidence does not point to a reduction in the risk of death with the empirical addition of anti-gram-positive (antiGP) antibiotics. Twelve studies assessed their addition to the initial antibiotic regimen among non-selected febrile neutropenic patients. Two studies assessed their addition after 48 to 72 hours of persistent fever. Both combined and separately, these studies show that there is no difference in overall 30-day patient mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.25) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Failure of the empirical antibiotic regimen, denoting mainly the need to add or change antibiotic therapy, was more common in the control arm in studies assessing the initial, empirical, addition of antiGP treatment. No such advantage was demonstrated for the addition of glycopeptides for persistent fever. Most studies included in the review were conducted at the time when practice guidelines suggested the addition of empirical antiGP treatment on day three to five for persistent fever (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1990</LINK>). Similarly, amphotericin was added more frequently to the control arm. Current guidelines advise addition of antifungal therapy on day five to seven for persistent fever with neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>). Thus, treatment modifications and the addition of amphotericin may represent persistence of fever regardless of the incidence of uncontrolled infection or fungal infections. Overall failure, whether or not antibiotic treatment was modified, was equal in both study arms (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Results were similar when analysing the subgroup of patients ultimately diagnosed with gram-positive infections and, similarly, there was no association between the percentage of gram-positive bacteria among bacteraemic patients in each trial and the RR for mortality or treatment failure. The rate of antiGP infections did not correlate with study year as expected, possibly due to the differing locations and inclusion criteria of the studies included in the review. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate for mortality to very low for failure comprising treatment modifications.</P>
<P>In this update, one trial examining the effects of empirical tigecycline added to a backbone of piperacillin-tazobactam was included to the review and did not change the overall conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Bucaneve-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bucaneve 2014</LINK>). The addition of this study led to a new subgroup analysis of antiGP whose spectrum comprises and might enhance coverage against gram-negative bacteria. Exclusion of two such trials ( <LINK REF="STD-Bucaneve-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bucaneve 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Menichetti-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Menichetti 1986</LINK>) from the mortality analysis cancelled the advantage of empirical non-glycopeptide antiGP treatment.</P>
<P>Adverse events were more common in the antiGP arm as expected, but the difference was in minor adverse events (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). The most feared adverse outcome of adding an antibiotic, especially a glycopeptide, is the induction or selection of resistance. Studies conducted in other settings have shown that excessive use of glycopeptides is associated with increased rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and, vancomycin-resistant staphylococci (<LINK REF="REF-Gardete-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardete 2014</LINK>). Studies included in this review assessed superinfection rates and these did not increase in the antiGP arm. Rather, gram-positive bacterial superinfections were reduced in the treatment arm, possibly reflecting reduced detection of these infections in the presence of antiGP antibiotic treatment. However, there are no data on colonisation from these studies. Therefore, we do not know whether patients treated with glycopeptides were more likely to carry resistant gram-positive bacteria, an important factor when considering future infections and the environment. The assessment of resistance induction may require a longer timescale than possible in randomised trials.</P>
<P>Several limitations of our analysis should be noted. Firstly, all-cause mortality was reported only in eight of 14 included studies. We contacted the authors of the six studies with missing mortality data, of which four replied that the data could no longer be retrieved. Secondly, the definition for treatment failure varied between studies, such that we could not combine all studies to assess treatment failure, with or without treatment modifications. We have encountered methodological issues in included studies, which we could not correct for in the meta-analysis. Randomising patients more than once creates episode clusters in which individual outcomes are not independent. Since data could not be extracted only for the first episode of each included patient, we could not enter the data correctly for the analysis. ITT analysis was frequently missing and could not be reproduced since the number of patients excluded from each study arm was not consistently reported. While the handling of loss to follow-up with regard to measurable outcomes must entail some assumptions (carry-over, imputations, etc.), all randomised patients can be included in the all-cause mortality comparison. Adequate randomisation should ensure that deaths unrelated to infection are equally distributed between trial arms. Finally, our results pertain to patients with uncomplicated low- or high-risk febrile neutropenia, that is patients presenting without specific risk factors such as catheter-related infection, skin or soft-tissue infection, pneumonia, or haemodynamic instability, who were excluded from all existing trials. Current guidelines recommend empirical glycopeptide treatment for these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our conclusions are in accordance with current practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>). Non-selective empirical use of glycopeptides, initially or for persistent fever, is discouraged. Data from existing trials cannot aid in the selection of patient subgroups for whom an advantage does exist.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-03 14:22:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Further trials assessing empirical glycopeptide or other novel anti-gram-positive (antiGP) antibiotics may be justified only if the prevalence of resistant gram-positive infections increases. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cometta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cometta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 2000</LINK>) tested the addition of a glycopeptide for fever persisting more than 48 hours showing no benefit to this intervention, in line with the clinical practice of a longer time period of persisting fever. Future trials should perhaps assess the value of empirical antiGPs for fever persisting for a longer duration (e.g. five to seven days).</P>
<P>Further research should focus on risk factors defining specific patient groups who will benefit from the addition of glycopeptides prior to microbiological documentation of these infections.</P>
<P>Our analysis highlights the pitfalls of assessing treatment failure in these and similar studies. Results are dependent on the definition of failure. In most studies, failure was defined as a change in the empirical antibiotic regimen, an outcome that is not necessarily associated with patient morbidity. Survival is the ultimate goal of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Usually not chosen as a primary outcome due to the sample size calculation considerations, all-cause mortality should be reported in all trials assessing the management of febrile neutropenic patients. Other patient-relevant outcomes include number of febrile days, hospital days for patients surviving the infectious episode and adherence to chemotherapy regimen.</P>
<P>We showed that the use of glycopeptides was associated with fewer gram-positive superinfections. However, we do not rule out the possibility of resistance induced by their use by this as the trials did not assess the rates of colonisation with resistant microorganisms. Future studies must incorporate methods for surveillance of colonisation to correctly represent the effects of glycopeptide use on future infections and the environment.</P>
<P>All future studies should adhere to better methodological standards (<LINK REF="REF-Consort-statement" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consort statement</LINK>). Specifically, patients should be included in the study only once, data regarding overall mortality should be reported by ITT, and the number of exclusions after randomisation for all other outcomes should be reported per study arm.</P>

<P>In the 2017 update, we reconstructed the characteristics of the review between the different categories. The description of the studies included in the analysis has been moved to the section <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>. The subgroup analysis has been now added to <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria and the search strategy has been updated to include new antiGP antibiotics. A subgroup analysis has been added of antiGP antibiotics whose spectrum of coverage comprises gram-negative bacteria and those whose spectrum of coverage is restricted to gram-positive bacteria. This was deemed necessary since the new antiGP antibiotics have a combined spectrum of coverage. Furthermore, studies with more than 30% dropouts were excluded from analysis. In addition, 'Summary of findings' tables were provided to point out the major conclusions.</P>
