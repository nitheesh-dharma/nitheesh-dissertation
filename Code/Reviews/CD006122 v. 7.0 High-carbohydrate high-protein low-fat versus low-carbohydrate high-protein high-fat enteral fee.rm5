</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:07:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Feroze Y Sidhwa">
<P>Patients with severe burn injuries have increased metabolic needs. For this and other reasons, they are often fed a formula through a tube inserted directly into the stomach or small intestine, a process known as enteral feeding. Aggressive enteral feeding of burn patients with a high-protein diet is a core component of the treatment of severe burn injuries. However, the optimal proportions of fats and carbohydrates in feeding formulas are unknown. This review of 93 burn patients in two randomized controlled trials found that high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds reduced incidence of pneumonia compared with low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral feeds in patients hospitalized with severe burn injuries. No conclusions could be made about the effect of different enteral feeding regimens on death.</P>
<P>The strength of this review's findings were limited by the number, size, and quality of eligible trials. Further research is needed before strong scientific conclusions and sound clinical recommendations can be made.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:37:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nutritional support is critically important in patients with extensive burn injuries. In such patients, energy and protein requirements increase to approximately double the requirements of a healthy person. The introduction of "aggressive nutrition support" in burn patients in the early 1970s dramatically improved patient survival. A review from 1971 to 1975 (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1990</LINK>) of patients with burns to greater than 50% of total body surface area (TBSA) provided with adequate nutrition showed an 80% drop in mortality due to septicaemia. This decrease in septicaemia was attributed to aggressive nutritional support (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1990</LINK>). It is reported that the risk of death is markedly higher in patients who lose greater than one fourth of their body weight after burn injury (<LINK REF="REF-Herndon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herndon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research suggests nutritional support in burn patients will reduce the severity of the hypermetabolic response, reduce catabolism and loss of muscle mass, improve and hasten wound healing, reduce rates of infection, improve integrity and function of the gut, and reduce hospital length of stay.</P>
<P>Inappropriate nutritional support may lead to adverse outcomes including fatty liver disease, decreased lean muscle mass, increased body fat mass, cardiopulmonary complications, and increased infectious complications. Since these discoveries, nutritional support in burns patients has been investigated. Research has been completed on many aspects of nutritional requirements in burn patients, including timing of feeding, optimal tube placement, vitamin and mineral supplementation, fish oil supplementation, and use of immune-modulating amino acids and macronutrients. Despite the large amount of published research, optimal feeding practices have not yet been delineated. Macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat and protein) make up the base of nutritional support. If these proportions are incorrect the benefits of micronutrients may well be lost.<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:15:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Feroze Y Sidhwa">
<P>Patients with severe burns (second or third degree burns to greater than 10% of their total body surface area) often require aggressive nutritional support. The body's reaction to severe burns is a hypermetabolic response: greatly increased energy requirements, sustained release of catabolic hormones leading to muscle breakdown, and poor glycaemic control. Enteral feeding - controlled feeding of a prepared formula directly into the stomach or small intestine via a tube - is a mainstay of treatment for patients with severe burns (<LINK REF="REF-Herndon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herndon 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:16:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Feroze Y Sidhwa">
<P>This review explored the impact of macronutrient composition of enteral feeds (tube feeds into the stomach or intestine) on clinical outcomes. Parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding) was not investigated.</P>
<P>Macronutrients are "macromolecules in plant and animal structures that can be digested, absorbed and utilised by other organisms as energy sources and as a substrate for the synthesis of the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins required to maintain cell and system integrity" (<LINK REF="REF-Escott_x002d_Stump-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escott-Stump 2004</LINK>). Macronutrients of importance in humans are fat, carbohydrate and protein. In the healthy population it is recommended that at least 55% of energy comes from carbohydrate, less than 30% of energy comes from fat, and more than 15% of energy comes from protein.</P>
<P>Interventions for enteral feeding in burn patients can be split into two categories:</P>
<OL>
<LI>high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral formula (high-carbohydrate enteral formula) providing at least 55% of total energy from carbohydrates, 20-25% of total energy from protein, and less than 25% of energy from fat; or</LI>
<LI>low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral formula (high-fat enteral formula) providing less than 55% total energy from carbohydrates, 20-25% of total energy from protein, and at least 25% of total energy from fat.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Interventions may provide varying quantities of fish oils as a fat source. At least one study has linked fish oil supplementation to decreased infectious complications, reduced length of hospital stay, reduced incidence of diarrhoea, and decreased loss of muscle mass in burn patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gottschlich-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottschlich 1990b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enteral feeds are usually commenced within 24 hours of admission for severe burn injuries. The feeding tube may supply the stomach (as in orogastric, nasogastric, or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes) or the small intestine (as in nasoduodenal, nasojejunal, or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tubes), depending on various clinical factors and physician preference.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:35:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ratio of macronutrients in enteral feeds may influence clinical outcomes in burn patients in two ways:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Hypermetabolic response</HEADING>
<P>The hypermetabolic response to significant burn injury increases energy and protein requirements to approximately twice basal requirements and leads to significant loss of lean mass and total weight loss. Furthermore, the hypermetabolic response alters the way the body metabolises and utilises macronutrients. Breakdown of muscle tissue and fat stores is increased, with the breakdown products fuelling increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. This response cannot be completely stopped with currently available treatments, but it may be possible to reduce the severity of protein breakdown.</P>
<P>Variations in the macronutrient composition of enteral feeds may limit the detrimental effects of the hypermetabolic response. For example, it is suggested that a high-carbohydrate energy source may increase blood insulin levels, thereby reducing the hormonal stimulus for muscle protein catabolism.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance</HEADING>
<P>Burn patients on enteral feeds often experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or constipation, and often do not absorb dietary macronutrients as well as non-burn patients. Therefore, it is important to maximise GI tolerance in order to maximize the possibility of a patient receiving and absorbing required levels of nutrition.</P>
<P>It is possible that different macronutrient compositions will improve GI tolerance and thereby improve nutritional status and clinical outcomes. It is known that carbohydrates are digested more quickly than fats and proteins, and therefore it is hypothesised that a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen is more quickly absorbed than a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. Decreases in absorption time may improve GI tolerance in burn patients.</P>
<P>A study assessing diarrhoea in burns patients showed that using a lower fat feed (less than 20% of caloric intake) reduced the frequency of diarrhoea in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gottschlich-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottschlich 1988</LINK>). However, it remains unclear what combination of macronutrients the GI tract will tolerate best.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-29 20:37:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No systematic review has been completed investigating enteral feeding in burns patients and the role of fat and carbohydrates in optimising the management of a burn injury. This review will add to an overall understanding about the role of carbohydrates and fats in nutrition support in burn patients. The optimal combination of enteral macronutrients should help to optimise clinical outcomes in these patients by reducing the hypermetabolic response and muscle protein breakdown, and conversely by promoting anabolism and improved wound healing. Furthermore, optimization of enteral macronutrient proportions should improve GI tolerance, minimizing diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting, and promoting gut health generally. Assessing optimal macronutrient proportions may allow care providers to appropriately weigh patient factors (e.g. hyperglycaemia) when deciding whether or not to manipulate the macronutrient proportions in a patient's enteral formula.</P>
<P>This review seeks to aid in developing an evidence-based approach to the medico-nutritional management of burn patients, potentially justifying clinical recommendations and informing future research efforts.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed study quality (BM, FS).</P>
<P>The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in systematic reviews from the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) was used. Briefly, a two-part tool was used which addressed six specific domains for assessment of bias (listed below). Each domain included one or more specific entries in a "risk of bias" table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involved describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involved assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This was achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of "yes" indicated a low risk of bias, "no" indicated a high risk of bias, and "unclear" indicated unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>

<P>We found 1121 records through the searches. Based on title and abstract screening we excluded 1116 and examined 5 studies in further detail by obtaining full text copies. We excluded three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saffle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saffle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serog-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Serog 1983</LINK>) because their enteral feeding regimens did not meet the study requirements. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garrel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garrel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK>) were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. We had uniform inter-observer agreement on study inclusion eligibility (kappa = 1); no disagreements arose requiring discussion or a mediator. See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> for the results of the bias assessment tool for the two included studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK> reported a randomized controlled trial, initially enrolling 50 patients aged three years or older with thermal injury to greater than 10% TBSA. All patients were admitted to the Cincinnati Shriners Burns Institute or Cincinnati University Hospital within five days of burn between 6 April 1986 and 20 May 1988. No patient exclusion criteria were given. Patients were followed until death or discharge from the hospital. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups using "a random number table stratified for age, institution and burn size". The three treatment groups were group 1, a high-fat feed group; group 2, which received a high-carbohydrate "modular tube feed" designed by the study's authors; and group 3, another high-fat feed group. All patients enrolled in the study received vitamins A and C and zinc supplementation enterally. "Parenteral nutrition was reserved for those who could not be given adequate nutritional support enterally. It was used for as short a time as possible without compromising the adequacy of nutritional support." The number of patients requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and the mean number of days on TPN was not statistically significantly different between the three intervention groups.</P>
<P>The primary aim of this study was to "evaluate and differentiate the effects of three nutrition support regimens with one treatment group randomized to receive the new modular tube feeding." Outcomes assessed included diarrhoea (cumulative incidence as a percentage, total days with, and mean days with), constipation (number of patients experiencing, and total days with), glycaemic control (mean days requiring exogenous insulin, and mean insulin days), number of patients with bacteraemia, number of patients with wound infection, number of patients with pneumonia, mean days on ventilator, discharge weight as a percentage of pre-burn weight, and mortality. No data were available for sepsis score, time to healing, insulin requirements, protein turnover, nitrogen balance, or nutritional status serum markers.</P>
<P>Of the 50 patients initially enrolled in the study, 10 died before discharge. These patients' data were included in all measures other than hospital length of stay (<LINK REF="REF-Gottschlich-correspondence" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottschlich correspondence</LINK>), thus, this study's data were reported on an intention-to-treat basis. The study authors found no statistically significant differences in glycaemic control, days on ventilator, mortality, cumulative incidence of pneumonia or sepsis, or discharge weight as a percentage of pre-burn weight using analysis of variance between the three groups. No analysis combining groups 1 and 3 into 'high-fat' and comparing this combined group with group 2 as 'high-carbohydrate' was reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Garrel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garrel 1995</LINK> reported a randomized controlled trial, initially enrolling 43 adult patients with thermal injury to greater than 20% TBSA, excluding first-degree burns. All patients were admitted within 24 hours of injury between September 1990 and September 1994. Patient exclusion criteria included people aged over 65, body mass index greater than 30, pre-existing diabetes or chronic visceral insufficiency, and chronic use of either alcohol or cocaine. Patients were followed for 30 days. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups using a random number table. One treatment group received a high-fat enteral feeding formula, and was treated as the control group; the second group received a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding formula without omega-3 fatty acid supplementation; the third group received a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding formula with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. All treatment groups received parenteral nutrition in addition to enteral feeding. Energy delivered through parenteral nutrition was not statistically significantly different between the three intervention groups, nor was it statistically significantly different in a combined analysis of the two high-carbohydrate groups versus the high-fat (control) group.</P>
<P>The primary aim of the study was to assess the effects of high-carbohydrate enteral nutritional support with and without omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on clinical outcomes, protein sparing and several serum biomarkers, and to compare both of these enteral feeding regimens with the high-fat control group. Reported end-points included mortality, sepsis score, incidence of pneumonia, exogenous insulin requirements, and hospital length of stay. No data were available for number of days on ventilator, glycaemic control, weight change, protein turnover, nitrogen balance, nutritional status or bowel habits.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Garrel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garrel 1995</LINK> reported available case data for 37 patients with burn injury. Mortality and cumulative incidence of pneumonia were reported as dichotomous end-points, while sepsis score, daily insulin requirements, and hospital length of stay were reported as continuous or ordinal end-points. The study authors concluded that compared to the high-fat group, the high-carbohydrate groups had a lower 30-day cumulative incidence of pneumonia, and required less exogenous insulin. Differences in mortality, sepsis score and length of care did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK> reported intention-to-treat data for 50 patients with burn injury. Mortality, length of stay per percentage burn, cumulative incidence of pneumonia, cumulative incidence of sepsis, and cumulative incidence of constipation were reported as dichotomous end-points. Average days on ventilator, discharge weight as a percentage of pre-burn weight, mean diarrhoeal days, and mean days requiring exogenous insulin were reported as continuous end-points. This study reported statically significant reductions in wound infection (P &lt; 0.03) and length of stay (P &lt; 0.02) with low fat enteral feeds. It also identified trends to decreased diarrhoeal days and improved glucose tolerance although these were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Common outcomes between the two studies were mortality and cumulative incidence of pneumonia. Insulin requirements were reported in both papers, but <LINK REF="STD-Garrel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garrel 1995</LINK> did not report standard errors or confidence intervals, and attempts to contact the study authors were unsuccessful. In meta-analysis, use of a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen was associated with a mortality OR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.15, P = 0.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), and a cumulative incidence of pneumonia OR of 0.12 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.39, P = 0.004) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), compared to a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. The mortality OR did not reach statistical significance, while the cumulative incidence of pneumonia OR did reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Average number of days on a ventilator was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK> only. Combining groups 1 and 3 from this study to form a high-fat group and comparing to group 2 as a high-carbohydrate group, use of a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen was associated with a days on a ventilator mean difference (MD) of -3.30 (95% CI -5.80 to -0.80) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This result reached statistical significance (P value = 0.01). Note that these results are not from a meta-analysis of studies, but rather an analysis combining <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK>'s three groups into two.</P>
<P>No meta-analysis could be performed on the remaining outcomes data due to lack of similar outcomes reported between the two available studies.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-29 21:11:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review of the effect of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeding (high-carbohydrate enteral feeding) regimens versus low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral feeding (high-fat enteral feeding) regimens in patients with significant burn injuries includes two RCTs, one judged to be of moderate risk of bias, and the other as high. Each study had a small number of participants.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the two studies indicates the risk of pneumonia is lower in burn patients receiving a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen than in those receiving a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. No conclusions could be drawn about the risk of death in patients receiving the different feeding regimens.</P>
<P>There may be any number of molecular and/or cellular mechanisms to explain the decreased risk of pneumonia observed in patients receiving a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen compared to those receiving a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. Most immune system cells are obligate glucose consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Deitch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deitch 1995</LINK>), and research suggests rates of glycolysis may nearly double in severely burned patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1979</LINK>). High-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimens may supply glucose required by highly active immune system cells. Likewise, inadequate provision of dietary glucose may limit intracellular availability and subsequently impair immune system function. It is well established that chronic hyperglycaemia inhibits wound healing and increases the risk of infectious complications in the intensive care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Herndon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herndon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 2007</LINK>). However, severe burn patients develop a hypermetabolic response and are monitored closely in an intensive care setting, thus they are unlikely to become hyperglycaemic even in the setting of a high-carbohydrate diet. Conversely, high dietary fat intake may increase the risk of pneumonia by increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and negatively effecting prostaglandin metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Bernier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erridge 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that high-fat formulas are beneficial for ventilated burn patients because they may decrease CO<SUB>2</SUB> production (<LINK REF="REF-al-Saady-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">al Saady 1989</LINK>) and length of time requiring mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Berg 1994</LINK>). However, combining the three study groups reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK> into two groups - one high-carbohydrate enteral feeding group and one high-fat enteral feeding group - indicates that patients given a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen spend fewer mean days mechanically ventilated than patients given a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. (Note again: this observed effect is from one relatively small study judged to have a moderate risk of bias.) If this observed effect is a true effect, then a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen reduces the average time burn patients are exposed to one of the most important risk factors for developing pneumonia in the intensive care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Herndon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herndon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 2007</LINK>). The question then is: Why do patients given a high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimen spend less time on average undergoing mechanical ventilation than those given a high-fat enteral feeding regimen? Indeed, the answer may be because they are less likely to develop pneumonia and thus to require mechanical ventilation in the setting of respiratory failure.</P>
<P>Much remains unknown about the cellular and molecular effects of dietary carbohydrate and fat intake on the human body. Further research, particularly into the effects of dietary macronutrients on the acute phase response to injury, is essential to further our understanding of the role dietary macronutrients play in the treatment of severely burned patients, and of trauma patients generally.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-29 21:12:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the currently available evidence, consisting of two relatively small studies (one with moderate risk of bias and the other with a high risk of bias), no firm conclusion can be made. There may be a possible clinical benefit to high-carbohydrate enteral feeds compared with high-fat enteral feeds in the treatment of burn injuries: a reduced risk of pneumonia. The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this benefit may accrue remain unclear.</P>
<P>Based on the available evidence, one relatively small study with a moderate risk of bias, patients receiving high-carbohydrate feeds may spend less time undergoing mechanical ventilation than patients receiving a high-fat enteral feeding regimen. Again, why this may be the case is unclear.</P>
<P>While this review presents the currently available evidence, definitive clinical guidelines on the optimal macronutrient composition of enteral feeds in severely burned patients cannot be formulated without further research.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-29 21:13:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Feroze Y Sidhwa">
<P>Further research is needed in order to determine the proportion of macronutrients in enteral feeding regimens that will optimize patient outcomes following severe burn injuries. Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials of burn patients would most effectively establish optimal enteral feeding practices. Animal and human research utilizing clinical outcomes as well as various biomarkers may add to our understanding of why high-carbohydrate enteral feeding regimens appear to be more beneficial to burn patients when compared to high-fat enteral feeding regimens. Continued research into the cellular and molecular effects of dietary fats and carbohydrates on the acute phase response to injury may help guide clinical research.</P>

<P>Cochrane guidance on the assessment of the risk of bias for included studies has changed since publication of the protocol on which this review was based. The instructions from the latest version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were used as the basis for this review. Some grey literature sources mentioned in the protocol were excluded and others were included based on availability. Comparative data on time to healing, weight, protein turnover, nutritional status markers and bowel habits were not included in the final review as each was reported in only one of the two studies included in the review.</P>
<P>The protocol stated study participants would be limited to "patients with burns to 15% TBSA or greater...". This review includes patients with burns to 10% TBSA or greater. This was done so that <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 1990a</LINK> could be included, and because no widely recognized definition of "severe" burn injury exists.</P>
<P>The protocol stated trials "allowing greater than 50% of intake from alternative sources of nutrition" and trials "that provide significant volumes of dextrose infusions in conjunction with low carbohydrate feeds" would be excluded. This exclusion criteria was modified for this review, as macronutrients provided through parenteral feeding did not differ between groups and authors were confident any feeding effects would be related to enteral feeds.</P>
