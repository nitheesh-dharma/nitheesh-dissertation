<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Treatments for alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There is no good trial evidence that any treatments provide long-term benefit to patients with alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis.</P>
<P>Alopecia areata is a condition that causes patchy hair loss. The size and number of patches and progress of the disease can vary between people. It can affect the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or cause loss of all body hair (alopecia universalis). Sometimes the condition will get better on its own, but in some cases it can get worse. </P>
<P>Treatments include a variety of different creams or lotions applied to the scalp such as topical or oral corticosteroids, minoxidil and some light-based therapies. Some of the skin treatments can have unpleasant side effects such as itching or hair growth in areas of the body away from where the cream was applied. Oral steroids may cause serious side effects. Also, there is no guarantee that any hair regrown during treatment will persist once the treatment is finished.</P>
<P>We found 17 randomised controlled trials involving 540 participants. Only one study which compared two topical corticosteroids showed significant short-term benefits. No studies showed long-term beneficial hair growth. None of the included studies asked participants to report their opinion of hair growth or whether their quality of life had improved with the treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alopecia areata is a disorder in which there is loss of hair causing patches of baldness but with no scarring of the affected area. It can affect the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or cause loss of all body hair (alopecia universalis). It is a relatively common condition affecting 0.15% of the population. Although in many cases it can be a self-limiting condition, nevertheless hair loss can often have a severe social and emotional impact. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of interventions used in the management of alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register in February 2006, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (from 2003 to February 2006), EMBASE (from 2005 to February 2006), PsycINFO (from 1806 to February 2006), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine, from 1985 to February 2006), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, from 1982 to February 2006), and reference lists of articles. We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of both topical and systemic interventions for alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, and alopecia universalis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We contacted trial authors for more information. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen trials were included with a total of 540 participants. Each trial included from 6 to 85 participants and they assessed a range of interventions that included topical and oral corticosteroids, topical ciclosporin, photodynamic therapy and topical minoxidil. Overall, none of the interventions showed significant treatment benefit in terms of hair growth when compared with placebo. We did not find any studies where the participants self-assessed their hair growth or quality of life.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Few treatments for alopecia areata have been well evaluated in randomised trials. We found no RCTs on the use of diphencyprone, dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional corticosteroids or dithranol although they are commonly used for the treatment of alopecia areata. Similarly although topical steroids and minoxidil are widely prescribed and appear to be safe, there is no convincing evidence that they are beneficial in the long-term. Most trials have been reported poorly and are so small that any important clinical benefits are inconclusive. There is a desperate need for large well conducted studies that evaluate long-term effects of therapies on quality of life. </P>
<P>Considering the possibility of spontaneous remission especially for those in the early stages of the disease, the options of not being treated therapeutically or, depending on individual preference wearing a wig may be alternative ways of dealing with this condition.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-25 17:28:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Alopecia areata is a disorder where there is a loss of hair with no scarring to the affected area (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The cause of alopecia areata is not yet fully understood (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2000</LINK>). It can start at any age, although the majority (60%) of individuals develop alopecia areata before 20 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>). Both sexes are affected equally and there is no known race preponderance.</P>
<P>The severity and pattern of hair loss can vary considerably between individuals. Alopecia areata is typically multi-focal, occurring on the scalp or any other hair-bearing region of skin (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1999</LINK>). The bald areas are commonly oval or circular in shape and smooth to the touch. Hair shaped like an exclamation mark can be present around the margins of the patch. The condition can affect the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or can cause loss of all body and scalp hair (alopecia universalis) (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1999</LINK>). The number of people with alopecia areata who progress to develop alopecia totalis or universalis is not known, but estimates range from 7 to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1963</LINK>). Vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disorders are sometimes associated with alopecia areata (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Alopecia areata is a relatively common condition which occurs all over the world (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>). It accounts for approximately 2% of new cases attending dermatology outpatient clinics in the UK and USA (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>). A population-based study in Minnesota, USA, found an overall incidence of alopecia areata was 20.2 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Safavi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safavi 1995</LINK>). The lifetime risk has been estimated at 1.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Safavi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safavi 1995</LINK>). The majority of people affected experience only the occasional bald area, which spontaneously resolves within a year, but most will suffer a relapse at some stage in their life. The prognostic factors for a less favourable outcome include: a family history of alopecia areata; childhood onset of alopecia areata; severe hair loss, as in alopecia totalis or universalis; a history of atopic diseases such as eczema, asthma or hay fever; other autoimmune conditions, particularly thyroid disease (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease which affects genetically susceptible individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Colombe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombe 1999</LINK>). The autoimmune response may be triggered by the interaction of genetic and other factors, such as physical stress, trauma or a major life crisis (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>), but often a specific trigger cannot be identified (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Alopecia areata can cause significant psychosocial problems. In an image orientated society, hair loss can be psychologically devastating for people affected and their families. Hair defines individuality and appearance; therefore, alopecia may result in reduced self-esteem and may negatively affect the quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-McMichael-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMichael 1998</LINK>). The unpredictable nature of the disease and the possibility of long-term, potentially unpleasant, therapy all add to the anxiety experienced when living with this condition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-25 14:32:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In alopecia areata the hair follicle is not destroyed and maintains the potential to re-grow hair should the disease go into remission (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1999</LINK>). There is, however, no cure for alopecia areata and no universally proven therapy to induce hair re-growth and sustain remission (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1999</LINK>). It is unclear if any treatment alters the long-term course of the disease (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1999</LINK>). It can be difficult to assess the efficacy of interventions in the absence of a control group because spontaneous recovery can occur, particularly in mild forms of the disease. A range of therapies are available that may promote acceptable hair re-growth, however, clinical outcomes are variable. It is particularly frustrating for the person affected if the therapy induces only temporary hair re-growth, or if new bald areas occur as those being treated improve. Treatment choice depends on two main factors: the extent of hair loss, and the age of the person (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>). However, treatment decisions may also be influenced by drug availability, anecdote and the personal preference of the individual with hair loss.<BR/>
<BR/>Current treatments include: topical corticosteroids; corticosteroids injected directly into the bald patch (not usually used for young children); systemic immunosuppression, e.g. psoralens taken by mouth plus exposure to ultraviolet light A (PUVA); corticosteroids (taken orally or by injection); oral ciclosporin; topical immunotherapy, e.g. diphencyprone (DPCP); anthralin; minoxidil therapy (also used in combination with corticosteroids).</P>
<P>All of the above therapies have documented side effects, some of which can be unpleasant or potentially serious. Treatments such as topical immunotherapy can be very time consuming. Individuals may consider the adverse effects of treatment and the unpredictable outcome unacceptable. When hair loss is extensive, a wig or hairpiece may be worn during treatment, or be a long-term option if the alopecia persists.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-06 14:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There is some evidence in the literature to support the use of the above therapies. However, many of the trials include people with different degrees of alopecia or with poorly defined disease. Adverse effects may be an important factor to consider for some of the therapies, such as the systemic agents. Topical immunotherapy is widely used, yet not licensed for such use. This systematic review will help determine the most effective therapies, when and for whom they should be used, the duration of treatment, possible risks and side effects and the level of acceptability for the person affected. It will also enable an assessment of the level and quality of the evidence that is currently available, and will identify areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge that require further research.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-04-25 15:44:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>After data extraction, our analyses differed slightly from the plan in our protocol:<BR/>There were only two studies with a similar type of intervention where a meta-analysis was performed to calculate a weighted treatment effect using a random effects model. The results have been expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes which were deemed to be more suitable for pharmaceutical interventions than expressing the results as odds ratios which was the original plan. Where it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, the data has been summarised for each trial. We did not find any paper with continuous outcomes.</P>
<P>Only two of the trials explicitly stated intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, where this was not stated we used the numbers originally randomized to the groups even though there were dropouts in most of the trials.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-04-25 15:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There was one cross-over trial by White 1985: only the data from the first phase of the trial was analysed. However, there were no usable data to combine with the results from other parallel group studies.</P>
<P>For the within-patient studies, we extracted the data and results of statistical tests from the original papers. We did not combine data from parallel and within-patient studies as there is some evidence that there can be systemic effects away from the site of topical application (<LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>We originally stated we would list non-randomised controlled studies, but this was not feasible because the searches found a large number of such studies. We have referred only to those studies that initially appeared to be RCTs but upon further examination were excluded; we have not listed all the controlled clinical trials.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-04-25 15:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We planned to assess heterogeneity using I<SUP>2</SUP> and if substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) existed we would have explored the possible reasons for this, such as disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. However, because there were so few studies there was not much heterogeneity. The studies were clinically heterogenous for variables such as disease duration and duration of treatment.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-04-25 15:39:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Our primary outcome measure was 'the proportion of participants with clinically significant hair regrowth, as rated by the participant or medical practitioner'. However as the participant rated assessment was not reported in any of the included trials, we used the clinician rating instead, and highlight the lack of participant-reported outcomes in our conclusion.</P>
<P>We have taken an outcome measure of &gt;50% re-growth of the affected area as the measure of moderate hair growth and thus as a clinically significant improvement. Our reason for deviating from the protocol was because once we started data extraction we became aware that many of the studies did not report on 'clinically significant hair growth' and we thought that this measure would be a pragmatic means to indicate treatment benefit with those with this hair loss condition.</P>
<P>We considered data that have been recorded for less than six months as reflecting short-term benefit. We analysed this data separately from data that had been recorded for greater than six months, which we considered to reflect a minimum time period to capture any longer term benefit.</P>

We hope to include these studies in future revisions of this review.</P>
<P>There were five publications describing two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Khoury-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 1992</LINK>); these are grouped together in the included studies references and the primary paper indicated.</P>
<P>We did not find a single study where participant self-assessment was evaluated and reported, nor were there any quality of life measures. We found only clinician rated evaluations.</P>
<P>As alopecia areata is a chronic relapsing condition, we expected to find studies addressing the long-term sustainability of hair growth and the quality of hair re-grown.</P>
<P>There were several studies of six months duration or longer which we classed as the 'long-term' studies, these were: <LINK REF="STD-Perini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perini 1994</LINK> (six months), <LINK REF="STD-Pipoli-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pipoli 1995</LINK> (outcome data reported at six months after finishing therapy), <LINK REF="STD-Rongioletti-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rongioletti 1992</LINK> (six months), and <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>(nine months) and <LINK REF="STD-Galbraith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Galbraith 1987</LINK> (10 months).

<P>Our assessment of the risk of bias in the included studies has broadly followed the criteria we set out in the protocol. However, we now consider that the criteria we laid down, specifically; 'aims, interventions and outcome measures clearly defined' and 'use of appropriateness of statistical analyses' do not fully define the quality of these studies. The 'degree of certainty that the participants have alopecia areata, totalis or universalis' was clearly defined in all the included studies. We think in general the quality of the studies was poor for the following reasons:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>There were only four studies where the method of generation of the randomisation sequence was clearly stated: <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK> used a computer generated randomisation list by Arcus Quickstat, <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK> used a computer generated code and <LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK> used a random numbers table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation</HEADING>
<P>The method of allocation concealment was considered unclear in all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> where a phone call centralised procedure was used for each eligible participant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In the majority of the studies blinding of the participants was generally clearly stated but the blinding of the clinicians or assessors was ambiguous. In four of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000; <LINK REF="STD-Pipoli-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pipoli 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>) the reference to blinding of the participants, the clinicians and the assessors was not stated clearly.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow-up and exclusions</HEADING>
<P>There were only two studies where intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was stated. These were <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK>. Participants were analysed according to the intervention group to which they were initially randomised. In several of the studies we were able to extract data which allowed us to use ITT analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Baseline assessment</HEADING>
<P>In most of the studies some reference was made to the characteristics of the treatment and control groups. The majority of the trials involved participants with moderate to severe alopecia at baseline but generally there was a wide age range and disease duration e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Price-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1987a</LINK>. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000 and <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> were assessed as having patchy or mild to moderate hair loss. Four studies had more females than males participating (<LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1987a</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1985" TYPE="STUDY">White 1985</LINK>). In two studies the participants had the disease for longer in the treatment than in the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000; <LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK> ) but in one study the placebo group had greater age and greater disease duration (<LINK REF="STD-Khoury-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> only treated those with alopecia of the eyebrows.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-04-25 17:22:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We did not find the outcome measures we had expected when we wrote the protocol. We had defined our primary outcome measures as the proportion of participants with clinically significant hair growth as rated by the participants or medical practitioners and improvement in quality of life as measured by questionnaires. In all of these studies the measure of hair growth was reported by the clinicians or assessors and not the participants even though in at least one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK>) there was a planned assessment of the global severity of hair loss by the participant and the clinician, but this did not appear to be reported. We did not find any quality of life measurements.<BR/>
<BR/>We defined clinically significant hair growth as &gt;50% re-growth of the affected area.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were adverse events either serious enough to require withdrawal of treatment or more minor participant reported effects which did not require withdrawal of treatment; long-term hair regrowth and its pattern and quality. We have described these below and have recorded them in the Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>The tertiary outcome measure was whether the interventions tested had an effect in preventing further episodes of hair loss. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Price-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1987a</LINK> two of the participants continued using 3% minoxidil in an open-label extension to the study, one for two years and the other for four years. At the end of these time periods they both had 90% scalp coverage, and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK>, three of the six participants elected to continue the treatment schedule but there was no report of the effect of this on their hair growth. In neither study did the trial authors indicate whether hair regrowth continued satisfactorily after the participants finished the treatment. We did not find any studies which evaluated whether the interventions could prevent further episodes of hair loss.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Topical Corticosteroids:</HEADING>
<P>Three RCTs involving 165 participants assessed the effect of topical corticosteroids on alopecia areata, which included one within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK>). The parallel studies by <LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000 and <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> could not be pooled due to different treatments being assessed in the studies. Therefore data are presented for individual studies.</P>
<P>Desoximetasone cream versus placebo</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000 involving 70 participants, short term hair growth (12 weeks) was not significantly better in participants using desoximetasone as compared to those using placebo (RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.67,1.50; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Betamethasone valerate foam versus betamethasone dipropionate lotion</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> study at week 20 (short term), 23/31 of the group receiving betamethasone valerate foam (BVF) achieved a regrowth score of 3 or more compared with 9/30 in the group receiving betamethasone dipropionate lotion (BDL). A score of 3 related to 51 to 75% hair regrowth and a score of four to &gt;75% hair regrowth. Thus, BVF was significantly more effective than BDL in treating mild to moderate alopecia areata, (RR 2.47; 95% CI 1.38, 4.44; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There was no vehicle control in this study and some of the benefit may have been due to the vehicle rather than the active ingredient.</P>
<P>In a 12-week within-patient study by <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK>, 7/34 on the clobetasol propionate foam-treated sites had hair re-growth scores of &gt;3 compared to 1/34 on the placebo treated sites. A re-growth score of three indicated hair re-growth of &gt;50% on the treated sites. No formal statistical tests were performed in the original paper.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Systemic Corticosteroids:</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK>) involving 43 participants compared systemic corticosteroids with placebo tablets.</P>
<P>Oral prednisolone versus placebo</P>
<P>Oral prednisolone was administered as a weekly 'pulse' of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK>). This was a short term study. The trial authors stated that &#8805;31% hair growth was 'a significant regrowth of hair' but this level of hair regrowth did not meet our outcome measure of clinically significant hair growth. However, 2 of the 23 participants on prednisolone had hair regrowth of &gt;60% compared to none of those on placebo (RR 4.38; 95% CI 0.22, 86.08; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). It is not clear if the two participants on prednisolone who had this substantial hair regrowth were the two who relapsed at three months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Topical ciclosporin:</HEADING>
<P>There were three studies involving 128 participants which compared topical ciclosporin to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rongioletti-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rongioletti 1992</LINK>) or other therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ciclosporin A versus liposomal vehicle</P>
<P>The global severity of hair loss was measured in the 17 participants <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK>; there was a slight increase in severity in the ciclosporin group and a decrease in severity in the vehicle group: no figures were given but this was reported as not significant in the original publication. However one participant in each group experienced good regrowth which has been taken to mean clinically significant hair growth, but this was not statistically significantly different between the intervention groups (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.07, 12.00; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). We classed this as a short term study as it was less than six months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Photodynamic therapy (PDT):</HEADING>
<P>Two RCTs involving 32 participants were included that assessed photodynamic therapy for treating alopecia areata (<LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK> study was a within-patient study on six participants for 10 weeks. Four circular sites on the scalp were randomly allocated to treatment with vehicle or three concentrations of topical aminolaevulinic acid lotion and then photodynamic therapy. Each site was assessed for the aggregated effect of treatment. The original paper reported there was no significant difference in hair growth compared to baseline for any of the three concentrations of aminolaevulinic acid or vehicle. All the participants completed the scheduled treatment sessions and three decided to continue beyond the period of the trial.</P>
<P>The three-armed study by <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK> (see above) compared photochemotherapy (PUVA) in eight participants with topical ciclosporin in eight participants. There was no cosmetically acceptable improvement seen in any of the participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Topical ciclosporin:</HEADING>
<P>Ciclosporin A versus liposomal vehicle</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Rongioletti-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rongioletti 1992</LINK> trial, of the 85 participants randomised to ciclosporin A gel or placebo for six months, 6/42 on ciclosporin and 3/43 on placebo had complete regrowth of hair. This was not significantly different between the treatment groups (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.55, 7.66; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). We classed this as a long-term study.Twenty six participants who had been unresponsive to other therapies were allocated to ciclosporin or PUVA or thymopentin (<LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>). There was no cosmetically acceptable improvement in hair growth in any of the groups after nine months of treatment.</P>
<P>Adverse effects</P>
<P>Desoximetasone cream (<LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000) caused mild itching, transient burning and acneiform eruption in 3 participants; there was no report on why 16 participants did not complete the study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> study self -reporting of adverse reactions by the participants was employed throughout the study but the results of this were not formally documented. They reported that two participants in the BVF group and one participant in the BDL group experienced mild folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). One participant of the BVF group and three participants of the BDL group discontinued their participation due to lack of efficacy of the treatments; it was not clear whether these were the participants who had experienced folliculitis. In the clobetasol propionate foam study (<LINK REF="STD-Tosti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 2005</LINK>) one participant experienced folliculitis. It is not clear if this was the reason for the withdrawal of one participant before week 12.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>The only report of adverse effects was pilar keratosis (thickening or hyperkeratosis around the hair follicles) and extensive folliculitis in one participant in the <LINK REF="STD-Rongioletti-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rongioletti 1992</LINK> study where there were 29 drop-outs with no explanation. In the <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK> study three participants were dropped from the study due to non-compliance: one from the topical ciclosporin group and the other two from the placebo group. Although no side effects were reported the trial authors did find a slightly increased global hair loss in the intervention group. The <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK> study used several interventions and noticed the development of fibrotic tracts which replaced lost hair follicles; no mention was made of how many participants experienced this effect and whether it affected all three groups.</P>
<P>Photodynamic therapy was given after the topical application of 5-aminolaevulinic acid as a photosensitiser. This caused erythema, pigmentation and moderate burning in three participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK> study and minor erosions in two participants and pustules in another.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK> study there were significantly more side effects in the prednisolone group (11/23) than in the placebo group (2/20) (RR 4.78; 95% CI 1.20, 19.05; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) which manifested initially as a general weakness, then acneiform eruption, weight gain, gastrointestinal upset, moon-like facies and oligomenorrhea. None of these side effects were serious enough to stop the therapy. However seven participants withdrew for 'reasons unrelated to the study'.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pipoli-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pipoli 1995</LINK>) involving 30 participants was included which compared the effects of two immunomodulatory drugs and a combination of the two on hair growth.</P>
<P>Thirty participants with severe alopecia areata were randomly assigned to squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE), lymphoblastoid interferon (IFN) or a combination of both. Variable treatment durations were used for the participants which ranged from 12 to 32 weeks. The results were given at a time six months after discontinuation of the particular therapy: 5/10 in the combination group and 2/10 in the SADBE group and 2/10 in the IFN group achieved scores of two or three. A score of two meant full recovery with relapse within the six month period; a score of three was a full and stable recovery with no relapse within a six month period. Results are presented as the combination treatment group versus the two single treatments. The long-term effect on hair growth was more successful with the combination therapy than the individual therapies but the effect was not significant. (RR 2.5; 95% CI 0.63, 10.0; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse Effects</P>
<P>No participants dropped out of this study due to ill effects. Those on interferon experienced 'flu-like symptoms which resolved after a few doses. The participants allocated to SADBE were monitored so that the erythema and mild pruritus that is necessary for this treatment was not allowed to develop into a severe exudative reaction.</P>

Topical minoxidil had little effect on hair growth, especially in the studies under 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoury-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Khoury 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1985" TYPE="STUDY">White 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the within-patient study by <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1993</LINK>, there were 5 'responders', which was defined as more than 75% hair re-growth. Two of the six participants whose scalps had been allocated to 5% minoxidil after DPCP sensitisation and three of the participants whose scalps had received vehicle only after DPCP sensitisation were responders. However there was no information provided about which group the two participants who withdrew were originally allocated, so we could not include this study in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The cross-over study by <LINK REF="STD-White-1985" TYPE="STUDY">White 1985</LINK> had no wash-out period between phases, so only the data from the first 16 weeks was used. No participant achieved grade four which was 'moderate growth of terminal hair'.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-04-25 16:34:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The overall efficacy of the treatments identified in the review which included immunosuppressant therapies, topical immunotherapies and hair growth stimulants was poor for the pre-specified outcome of clinically significant hair re-growth. Only one study showed a statistically significant effect of the treatment intervention but this compared two different treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK>) and the participants only had a mild patchy form of alopecia. Care has to be exercised in not concluding that none of the treatments work when so many of the studies were so small. As indicated by the wide 95% confidence intervals for many of the included study results, many interventions could still prove to have a clinically useful benefit if they were evaluated in an adequately powered study.<BR/>
<BR/>Most of the studies were of short-term (less than six months) duration and reported only short-term outcomes. However, where studies reported longer-term outcomes (more than six months), long-term sustainability of the effects of interventions was poor in terms of continued hair growth. This is not completely unexpected because people with alopecia areata have an ongoing predisposition to the disease and the condition tends to be chronic and relapsing. Current treatments are essentially immunosuppressive and do not permanently change the immune system or the genetic predisposition of the individual or any of the potential environmental triggers. Therefore, even if a treatment worked in the first place, it is expected that the disease may relapse when the treatment is stopped. Similarly, long-term cure is unlikely. Perhaps it would be useful in future studies to assess whether;<BR/>(i) a treatment is successful while in use<BR/>(ii) there is any long-term benefit which persists after the course of treatment has finished.</P>
<P>We regret that we identified several studies which we felt unable to include because we could not discern whether the outcome was clinically significant hair re-growth. If we receive clarification from the trial authors we shall include them in the update to this review.<BR/>
<BR/>In our view one true measure of a successful treatment for the person with alopecia areata would be if they reported satisfaction with their hair re-growth for a sustained period of time. Participants undertaking treatment are likely to view the best outcome as sustained hair re-growth and if applicable to stop wearing a wig or to be able to report satisfaction with their appearance. For people with severe sustained hair loss as in alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, successful treatment outcomes are more difficult for researchers to achieve. However, people may still feel unable to stop wearing a wig despite achieving 'significant hair growth' (<LINK REF="STD-Vestey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vestey 1986</LINK>). None of the participants in any of the studies achieved these participant-orientated, clinically meaningful outcomes.</P>
<P>The lack of success of treatment for participants with alopecia areata relates to the severity and duration of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Steen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Steen 1991</LINK>). For those in the early stages of the disease or with less than 25% scalp hair loss alopecia areata has a high degree of natural resolution. <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> readily conceded the success of their study comparing two active treatments and no placebo group may be due in some part to the natural history of the disease.</P>
<P>By contrast, participants with long-standing alopecia areata, or those with alopecia totalis/universalis, are less likely to respond to treatment. Data suggest that fewer than 10% of people with severe disease fully recover (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-Hull-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald Hull 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK> set out to test whether those participants with alopecia areata who had not responded to other sensitising therapies would respond when randomly allocated to a variety of other treatments. They concluded that transferring these 'non-responder' participants to other therapies was 'useless'.</P>
<P>Most studies included a heterogenous participant population with wide disease severity and duration. Only one study assessed participants with patchy alopecia areata alone (<LINK REF="STD-Charuwichitratana" TYPE="STUDY">Charuwichitratana</LINK> 2000) but did not define 'patchy', whilst only <LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK> assessed participants with &lt;26% hair loss.</P>

<P>Overall, considerable numbers of participants withdrew or were lost to follow up. In some studies no reason was given for this (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Kar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kar 2005</LINK>), but in others it is clear that participants were disheartened by the lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK>). In others the time commitment expected of the participants was considerable in terms of application of treatments and clinic visits (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK>) and may have lead to drop-outs or non-compliance. <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK> expressed concern about the poor skin penetration and therefore lack of efficacy of the drug that they were using in their trial.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-04-25 16:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Alopecia areata has considerable likelihood of natural remission especially in the early stages of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Madani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madani 2000</LINK>): this complicates interpretation of a successful response to treatment particularly where numbers of participants in each arm of the trial are so low. Where participants have alopecia areata that involves less than 25% hair loss from the scalp or where they have had the disease for less than a year, up to 50% of successful re-growth may be spontaneous (<LINK REF="STD-Mancuso-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mancuso 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other situations where interpretation of the results may be complicated are where topical treatments for hair growth may have systemic effects, which is especially relevant in within-patient trials. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bissonnette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bissonnette 2000</LINK> study, hair growth occurred beyond the treatment areas of the scalp. Hair growth may also occur at distant sites e.g. hair growth on face (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1987b</LINK>) or toes (<LINK REF="STD-White-1985" TYPE="STUDY">White 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast, other treatments such as topical ciclosporin appeared to be ineffective due to lack of drug penetration (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rongioletti-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rongioletti 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tosti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tosti 1991</LINK>), it is not clear whether ciclosporin might be of benefit if the drug could be adequately absorbed into the scalp. There are no RCTs which assess systemic use of ciclosporin in treating alopecia areata.</P>

<P>The difficulties in determining actual hair growth in clinically significant terms in these studies was due to a lack of any universal measure of successful hair growth. Ideally we were looking for hair growth that was cosmetically acceptable to the participant, but we found no reports of participant evaluation of the treatments. After assessing several of the studies we defined &gt;50% re-growth of the affected area as a measure of clinically significant hair growth. However it was not always possible to extract this information from the studies. <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2004</LINK> has tried to address the issue of defining and standardising measurement of hair loss so that results from studies might be more comparable.</P>
<P>Some readers might think that our exclusion of non-randomised controlled studies was a bit harsh, especially for studies of topical diphencyprone where some reports of half scalp application produces a clear half head of hair growth (<LINK REF="REF-Monk-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monk 1989</LINK>). Whilst we acknowledge that randomised controlled trials are sometimes not needed for treatments which may have a dramatic and persistent effect (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2007</LINK>), the evidence from trials of topical immunotherapy (including diphencyprone) suggests that response rates vary a lot from dramatic improvement to no regrowth at all. <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK> showed that studies with more positive effects are more likely to be published than those with less conclusive results, or those written in languages other than English. To tackle the problem of publication bias we wrote to authors asking for information, we searched databases of ongoing trials, and we searched the LILACS (Latin American and Carribean Health Science Information) database. Selective reporting of dramatic effects from non-randomised trials without any control group is likely to be very misleading therefore, and randomised controlled trials are needed to explore short and long-term effects across a group of participants of defined disease severity and duration.</P>

<P>Alopecia areata is a chronic hair loss disease in which it is very difficult to predict whether there will be periods of spontaneous remission or whether the pattern of hair loss will get progressively more severe. The results of our review are in agreement with the comments of <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2001</LINK>. There is such a lack of consistent response to the therapies that are available, that the Federal Drugs Administration (USA) does not have an approved list for this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is a condition that can cause psychosocial problems and more severe psychological effects on some individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Firooz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Firooz 2005</LINK>). We agree with the conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-Hull-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald Hull 2003</LINK> that considering the possibility of spontaneous remission and lack of efficacy of treatments the option of not treating with medications may be the best one for many participants. This discussion about choosing no therapy for alopecia areata has been ongoing for some time (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1987</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-Hull-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald Hull 2003</LINK> recommends intralesional corticosteroids for patchy hair loss: we found no evidence to support this because randomised trials have not been performed. We also found little evidence to support the use of contact immunotherapy for more extensive hair loss, and although diphencyprone is frequently used for severe alopecia areata we could find no RCTs, fulfilling our inclusion criteria, assessing its use.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Few treatments for alopecia areata have been well evaluated in randomised trials: there is no RCT evidence that steroids, whether topical, intralesional or systemic, are of benefit in treating alopecia areata. Systemic steroids have the potential to produce serious side effects. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence on use of topical minoxidil, topical ciclosporin, PDT, hair growth stimulants, or other immunotherapies for the treatment of alopecia areata.</P>
<P>Before starting treatment for alopecia areata, and especially in the early stages of the disease people should be informed of its natural history and the possibility of spontaneous remission and the lack of evidence for different treatments. We found no RCTs on the use of diphencyprone to treat alopecia areata, but it is frequently used and recommended for the treatment of extensive alopecia areata and alopecia totalis/universalis (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-Hull-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald Hull 2003</LINK>). Similarly although topical steroids and minoxidil are widely prescribed by dermatologists for limited patchy alopecia areata, and appear to be safe, there is no convincing evidence that they are beneficial. <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-Hull-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald Hull 2003</LINK> concluded that there was poor evidence to support the use of topical steroids and topical minoxidil.</P>
<P>It is clinically challenging when a patient with alopecia areata is desperately seeking treatment, to tell them that the evidence suggests that current treatment confers no long-term benefit. Considering the possibility of spontaneous remission and lack of efficacy of treatments, the option of not treating may be the best option for many patients. For some participants with extensive alopecia areata, wearing a wig might be a reasonable option. Healthcare practitioners can still play an important role in providing psycho-social support and information, and self help groups both online and face-to-face can be beneficial for some people. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Few treatments for alopecia areata have been well evaluated in randomised trials and we found none that addressed participant-focussed measures of success or measurements of quality of life. Addressing these deficiencies by means of high quality clinical trials has to be a priority and main conclusion from our review. </P>
<P>Future studies need to be much bigger than the current largely inconclusive small studies performed to date, and they should ideally include a placebo or vehicle group given the current uncertainty around whether any treatment works. In order that studies can be comparable there needs to be a clear definition of baseline measures of hair loss as well as success in terms of measuring scalp coverage, measurement of sustained hair re-growth and participant satisfaction. Future research should incorporate outcome measures that are clinically meaningful to participants.</P>
<P>Future trials should be designed to recruit participants who are clinically homogeneous, for example of similar disease severity or duration, or both, so that clinically meaningful outcomes can be used to better direct clinical practice. Similarly, because short-term interventions may not 'cure' alopecia areata or result in long-term benefit, trials should focus on assessing safe and sustainable treatments. <BR/> <BR/>There have been no trials involving the use of good quality wigs or alternative supportive therapies versus pharmaceutical interventions for alopecia areata. Such trials using patient satisfaction outcomes would be invaluable. There seems little point in doing more trials on topical ciclosporin and topical minoxidil. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus and topical immunotherapy with diphencyprone are possible future trial priorities. <BR/> <BR/>Although there are 'new' topical immunomodulating drugs and biologic therapies for the treatment of other immune-mediated inflammatory skin diseases ( <LINK REF="REF-Price-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMichael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMichael 2003</LINK>), evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to support their effectiveness in alopecia areata. However, reports of alopecia areata occurring during treatment with biologic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Tosti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tosti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-Bartels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia Bartels 2006</LINK>) suggest that their utility will be limited.</P>
<P>If more high quality RCTs were to be conducted comparing the variety of possible interventions for alopecia areata, there might be consensus about which treatment would be most effective at different stages of patchy hair loss and disease severity. A pseudo (non)- randomised study of aromatherapy showed promise but this warrants further study in RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1998</LINK>)</P>

<P>We added a sentence to the first of the primary outcome measures: We have taken &gt;50% re-growth of the affected area as the measure of moderate hair growth and thus as a clinically significant improvement.</P>
<P>In the Methods section under 'Measures of treatment effect', the results have been expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes which were deemed to be more suitable for pharmaceutical interventions than expressing the results as odds ratios which was the original plan.</P>

<P>In the Methods section under 'Data synthesis' we gave our reasons for using an outcome measure of &gt;50% re-growth of the affected area as the measure of moderate hair growth and thus as a clinically significant improvement. This was because once we started data extraction we became aware that many of the studies did not report on 'clinically significant hair growth' and we thought that this measure would be a pragmatic means to indicate treatment benefit with those with this hair loss condition.</P>
