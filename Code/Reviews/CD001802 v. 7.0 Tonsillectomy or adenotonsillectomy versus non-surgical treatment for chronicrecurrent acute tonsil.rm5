<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The general conclusions and recommendations regarding the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus (initial) non-surgical treatment remain unchanged.</P>
<P>We have reorganised the data-analysis, with the addition of new data since the last published update (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2009</LINK>). The data are now analysed as adeno-/tonsillectomy for adults and adeno-/tonsillectomy for children. We carried out additional sensitivity analyses to test whether any differences could be observed for adenotonsillectomy versus tonsillectomy alone, and to assess the impact of studies with high risk of attrition bias on the outcomes.</P>
<P>We have amended the analysis such that the data for children counted the episode of surgery as one episode of pain, and also counted the days of pain associated with the surgical procedure. However, it was not possible to do so for the data for adults, where the number of days of pain as a result of surgery were not included in the results for days with pain. Therefore, the data for adults still exclude the episode of pain and days of pain associated with the surgical procedure.</P>
<P>Two new review authors (Roderick Venekamp and Lee Yee Chong) joined the team to update this review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-17 11:25:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review compared the clinical effectiveness and safety of surgery (removal of the tonsils - tonsillectomy, or adenotonsillectomy - removal of the tonsils and adenoid tissues) against non-surgical management in adults and children with frequent or chronic tonsillitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Surgical removal of the tonsils is a commonly performed operation in patients with chronic or recurrent infections of the tonsils (tonsillitis) or the other tissues at the back of the throat (pharyngitis). Sometimes, the adenoid tissues are also removed during the surgery. However, opinions vary greatly about whether or not the benefits of these operations outweigh the risks.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included evidence available up to 30 June 2014. Seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias were included: five in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in 40 adults was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis.</P>
<P>Although some studies in children followed participants for two or three years, reliable information is only available for up to about one year after surgery due to the high number of participants missing follow-up after the first year. Some studies had recruited children who were more severely affected by tonsillitis than other studies (for example, they had tonsillitis more often and with more severe symptoms). Therefore, we grouped the children into 'severely affected' and 'less severely affected' subgroups.</P>
<P>Two studies in adults had a short duration of follow-up (five to six months following surgery).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>We found that in general children affected by recurrent acute tonsillitis may have a small benefit from adeno-/tonsillectomy: this procedure will avoid 0.6 episodes of any type of sore throat in the first year after surgery compared to non-surgical treatment. The children who had surgery had three episodes of sore throat on average compared to 3.6 episodes experienced by the other children. One of the three episodes is the episode of pain caused by surgery.</P>
<P>When it comes to avoiding bad sore throats, children who have more severe or frequent tonsillitis may benefit more from surgery compared to less severely affected children. In less severely affected children the potential benefits of adeno-/tonsillectomy are more uncertain. There are no good quality data for the effects of surgery in the second or later years after surgery.</P>
<P>We did not find enough evidence to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. Evidence is only available for the short term and is of low quality. The data are also difficult to interpret as the studies do not take into account the days of pain that always follow the operation. Based on the two small trials, tonsillectomy seems to result in fewer days of sore throat in the first six months after surgery.</P>
<P>Two of the studies in children said that they could not find a difference in quality of life outcomes and one study could not find a difference in the amount of painkiller that children took to help with their sore throats.</P>
<P>Bleeding immediately after tonsillectomy or in the two weeks following surgery is an important complication. The studies did not provide good information to allow us to assess accurately the risk of these complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the data on children (this means that further research is likely to have an important impact on how confident we are in the results and may change those results). Quality is affected by a large number of children who are 'lost to follow-up' after the first year of the study. In addition, some children who are assigned to the 'no surgery' group end up having surgery.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for tonsillectomy in adults in adults is low.</P>
<P>As always, any potential benefits of surgery should be carefully weighed against the possible harms as the procedure is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of bleeding (either during or after the surgery). In addition, even with good pain relief medication, the surgery is particularly uncomfortable for adults.</P>

<P>This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults.</P>
<P>We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of <I>any</I> <I>severity</I>) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period.</P>
<P>When we analysed only episodes of <I>moderate/severe</I> sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery.</P>
<P>Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality.</P>
<P>Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics.</P>
<P>Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-24 14:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.</P>
<P>Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion.</P>
<P>The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-17 11:29:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-19 12:47:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1999</LINK>) and previously updated in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sore throat is a common reason for consultation with a doctor in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2004</LINK>). The symptoms may be caused by infection of the pharynx in general or the tonsils in particular, in which case the terms pharyngitis and tonsillitis may be used respectively. It may be difficult, or impossible, to distinguish accurately between the two conditions, although when the tonsils are red and swollen a diagnosis of tonsillitis is more likely to be made. Doctors disagree on the clinical features that might allow a distinction to be made between tonsillitis and pharyngitis or sore throat.</P>
<P>Although self limiting in the vast majority of patients, the symptoms are inconvenient. As a consequence, antibiotics are frequently prescribed for this condition in general practice (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2004</LINK>). While many patients experience only occasional throat infections with a relatively short duration of illness, a subset of patients suffer from chronic/recurring acute episodes, which causes a considerable disease burden through frequent episodes of sore throat, fever, general illness, sleepless nights, impaired daily functioning and absence from school or work.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-24 14:41:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children (<LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1996</LINK>). Tonsillectomy is performed under general anaesthesia and involves surgical removal of the palatine tonsils from their investing tissues. The risks of surgery include those of the associated general anaesthetic and those specific to the procedure, for example bleeding immediately after surgery or as a result of secondary infection in the 10- to 14-day period after surgery. When the adenoids are also removed, this is called adenotonsillectomy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-24 14:42:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If a patient has no tonsils, they cannot get tonsillitis. However, they may still suffer from pharyngitis and sore throats. Whilst the palatine tonsils are considered to play an important role in the causation of chronic/recurrent acute throat infections, they are probably not the only factor responsible. As a consequence, tonsillectomy may prevent further throat infections and/or reduce the severity of future throat infections and could therefore considerably improve patients' daily functioning and health-related quality of life. It is unclear whether the removal of adenoids has additional benefits or harms compared to tonsillectomy alone.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-17 11:29:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The indications for tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) are controversial. It is generally accepted that tonsillectomy (with adenoidectomy, if necessary) is indicated in children with obstructive sleep apnoea. The role of the procedure in other types of sleep-disordered breathing is the subject of research and debate (<LINK REF="REF-Blackshaw-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackshaw 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venekamp-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venekamp 2014</LINK>). Although tonsillectomy is also frequently performed in patients who have chronic tonsillitis, recurrent acute tonsillitis or recurrent pharyngitis/'sore throats', opinions vary greatly as to whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks for this indication. We have mentioned the uncertainty surrounding the role of the tonsils (and therefore the effect of their removal) in people with recurrent episodes of tonsillitis/'sore throat'. An additional concern is that a past pattern of behaviour may not continue. Many patients with recurrent symptoms are said to 'grow out' of the problem. A proportion of patients with serious, recurrent symptoms now, will be symptom-free in 12 months' time. It has not been possible to identify specific risk factors that would allow those patients to be identified.</P>
<P>A non-systematic review of tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection was published in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK>). This review drew conclusions from trials which either did not fulfil the inclusion criteria for the present systematic review or which appeared to contain significant risk of bias. In the previous version of the current review (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2009</LINK>), we found four trials undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effectiveness of tonsillectomy was only available for (a) children and not adults, and (b) for the effects of surgery in the first year of treatment, not the second year or beyond. At that time we found one ongoing trial on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy compared to non-surgical management in children aged 4 to 15 years with recurrent sore throats (the North of England and Scotland Study of Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy in Children - NESSTAC). In the current update of our review, we included data from this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>), and one other (<LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>).</P>

We reviewed the included trials for potential differences between studies in terms of the types of participants recruited, interventions or control used and how outcomes were measured and/or reported.</P>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots and statistical tests for heterogeneity. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (with a significance level set at P value &lt; 0.10) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which calculates the percentage of variability which is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, with I<SUP>2</SUP> values over 50% suggesting substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We combined the results of individual studies in a meta-analysis where we judged participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes to be sufficiently similar, to ensure that an answer would be clinically meaningful.

<P>When this review was first undertaken, there was no evidence to suggest that variations in surgical treatment (in the form of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy) or in the specific surgical method (dissection, guillotine, electrocautery, laser, coblation or any other) were factors affecting the outcomes.</P>
<P>In one of the studies the outcomes of the tonsillectomy alone and adenotonsillectomy groups were compared (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>). Finding no "large or statistically significant" differences between them, the data sets were pooled and reported as a single 'surgical' group. It is, however, not clear whether the sizes of the two original subgroups were large enough to detect any true difference between the effects of tonsillectomy alone and adenotonsillectomy. Some part of the effect of 'surgery' could be due to removal of the adenoids. Therefore we planned to address these assumptions by sensitivity analysis if data were available. In further sensitivity analysis, we planned to assess the impact of studies with high risk of attrition bias on the outcomes</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings'</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we applied this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high quality of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low quality implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of the these factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>study limitations (risk of bias);</LI>
<LI>inconsistency;</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence;</LI>
<LI>imprecision; and</LI>
<LI>publication bias.</LI>

<P>The severity of symptoms required to enter the trials differed significantly. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> were only eligible if they were severely affected by tonsillitis; their episodes of throat infection met strict, pre-defined standards in each of four categories: (1) frequency of occurrence (seven or more episodes in the preceding year, or five or more in each of the preceding two years, or three or more in each of the preceding three years); (2) clinical features (each episode had to be characterised by specific clinical features); (3) treatment (they had to have been treated with antibiotics when streptococcal infection was proven or suspected); and (4) documentation (each episode had to have been be documented in a clinical record). Meanwhile, the other four studies were less strict in their criteria for severity or frequency of tonsillitis and included moderately affected children (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> recruited participants aged 15 years and above between 2001 and 2005, with proven group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

At least one episode had to be microbiologically proven by culture or rapid antigen test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> was conducted between 2007 and 2010. This study included patients aged 13 and above who were referred for tonsillectomy because of recurrent pharyngitis (three or more episodes in the previous 12 months).</P>

The control arms of both studies received "standard" medical treatment.</P>
<P>The Paradise studies had treated tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy as different intervention arms. In <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>, the results were reported together. <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK> were two trials that ran in parallel. <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK> included children with one or more indications for adenoidectomy (obstructing adenoids or history of recurrent or persistent otitis media) assigned randomly into adenotonsillectomy or control non-surgical intervention (two-arm trial). <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK> only included patients with no indications for adenoidectomy and they were randomly assigned to tonsillectomy, adenotonsillectomy or control (three-armed trial).

<P>The participants in the treatment arm of the two studies in adults received a tonsillectomy as soon as possible after randomisation. All patients had tonsillectomy (total capsular tonsillectomy using blunt or diathermy dissection), except one (who received adenotonsillectomy in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>). Both studies used "watchful waiting" as the control group. The control groups 'waited' for between three and six months in <LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> and between five and six months in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>.</P>
<P>Patients from both arms were advised to see their general practitioner (GP) whenever they had acute symptoms suggestive of pharyngitis. No specific treatment protocol was stated, although participants were also given information about the study for their GP, along with instructions about examining their ear, nose and throat status, how to take cultures and obtain the relevant blood samples.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK> study, participants in the surgery group underwent tonsillectomy within six weeks of trial entry. In the non-surgical group, the participants' general practitioners (GPs) prescribed an eight-day course of antibiotics for each episode of tonsillitis in the following year. Patients in this group were allowed to "opt out" and have surgery at any time. Patients who had surgery were reviewed every six months, up to the 18th month post-surgery. Patients in the antibiotics group were reviewed every three months in the outpatient clinic, and their GPs were sent study protocols and questionnaires, which they completed and returned to the investigators whenever the patients sought treatment (and received antibiotics) for tonsillitis. A final review was carried out between 18 and 24 months after entry to the trial.</P>

<P>The Paradise studies followed up participants over three years. A standardised in-person or telephone inquiry was made bi-weekly concerning the day to day occurrence of a specific list of symptoms and events, and standardised clinical examination was performed every six weeks and at the time of respiratory illness (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> collected data through patient diaries. In <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>, parents performed additional daily temperature measurements using an electronic thermometer that stored data, and these data were collected along with data from diaries and quality of life questionnaires during follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> were supposed to return the four-weekly diary by post, but telephone prompt interviews were introduced "part way through the study" due to low response rates to the health diary.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of sore throat and sore throat days</HEADING>
<P>Participants in two studies in adults were instructed to see their GP when they had signs and symptoms suggestive of pharyngitis, and instructions were given about collection of data from medical examination and throat culture (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>). Data were also collected by symptom diaries.</P>
<P>All studies reported the number of episodes of sore throat and number of days with sore throat, except for <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK>. However, there were variations in how studies defined what is considered a sore throat episode or a sore throat day, and whether the episode of pain and days of pain following surgery were included in their report of number of episodes of sore throat and sore throat days.</P>
<P>Based on the data reported, for children we were able to standardise the report of sore throat episodes to ensure all studies in children included the episode due to the surgery. No standardisation was required for sore throat days in children as all the included studies already included the postoperative days in their data sets.</P>
<P>The situation was different in adults. Both included studies excluded the episode of postoperative sore throat in those participants undergoing surgery and any days of sore throat due to the surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Definition of sore throat episodes and days</HEADING>
<P>The definition of what is considered an episode of sore throat and sore throat days varied:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the Paradise studies, results for episodes of '<U>throat infection</U>' are reported in four ways: (a) 'moderate or severe' (based on a scoring system), (b) streptococcal, (c) 'counting' (characterised by one or more qualifying clinical features of episodes used in determining trial eligibility), and (d) 'all combined' (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>In the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> trial, an episode '<U>throat infection</U>' was defined as sore throat or pain or difficulty swallowing <I>combined with </I>fever, whilst an episode of '<U>sore throat</U>' was defined as sore throat or pain or difficulty swallowing <I>with or without</I> fever.</LI>
<LI>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> trial, an episode of sore throat was defined as at least three consecutive days with sore throat. Any consecutive recording of sore throat interrupted by four days of non-recording constitutes a new episode.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> primarily looked for pharyngitis due to group A <I>Streptococcus</I> with a positive culture, and secondarily for 'all episodes of pharyngitis'.</LI>
<LI>In the <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> trial, an episode of sore throat was defined as at least two consecutive days with sore throat.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK> only reported the proportion of patients who "felt" their symptoms were "cured" after 18 months. This study did not report the number of episodes of sore throat or their severity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Compared to the more specific categories (a), (b) and (c), the Paradise category (d) - 'all combined' includes a broader spectrum that is more analogous to the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> category of '<U>sore throat episode</U>' than 'throat infection'. Thus, in this review, the data on 'episodes of sore throat of any severity' refer in the Paradise studies to the 'all types combined' category (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>), and in the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> trials to the 'episodes of sore throat' data. For the <LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> study, this refers to the "all episodes of pharyngitis" data rather than "pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus".</P>
<P>We also extracted the more severe sore throat episodes defined as 'moderate or severe' (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>) and 'throat infection' (<LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>). In our analyses these two categories are assumed equivalent; we recorded and analysed these as 'moderate or severe' episodes.</P>
<P>In all the Paradise studies a 'sore throat day' was defined as one on which a sore throat lasted an hour or longer. The comparable data from the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> trials were the number of sore throat days.</P>

<P>None of the studies stated an intention to record, and nor did they report, consumption of antibiotics or analgesics as outcomes. The studies also did not pre-specify which data on complications or morbidity would be collected and reported, apart from the number of days of pain post-surgery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> measured quality of life using the Glasgow Benefit Health Inventory, but this was done only for the tonsillectomy group. <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> used the TACQoL or TAPQoL but did not reported results in a way that could be meta-analysed. <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> used the PedsQoL.</P>

<P>We judged the methodological quality of most included trials to be moderate: see the 'Risk of bias' graph (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Details of the risk of bias in the included studies are presented in the 'Risk of bias' summary (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). We acknowledge that it is impossible for the patients in any tonsillectomy trial to be unaware of their group allocation. The two adult trials were at less risk of bias than the trials involving children, but this was almost entirely related to small losses to follow-up, as a result of short follow-up periods (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The method of random sequence generation was adequately described in six of the eight trials, whereas it was unclear in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK>). Furthermore, concealment of allocation was not adequately described in three (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and also the 'Risk of bias' tables in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We had concern about the effectiveness of allocation concealment when blocked randomisation using small blocks of three or four patients was used in these non-blinded studies and there was no description of the methods used to conceal the allocation of existing participants from the team members in charge of recruitment or enrolment of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one trial baseline characteristics appeared to be imbalanced (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>). The children in the surgery groups (tonsillectomy alone or adenotonsillectomy) differed from the control group in terms of the history of episodes of throat infection before entry into the study and in terms of parental socioeconomic status (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>, table 1). Those in the surgical group were more often admitted to the trial on the basis of frequent infection in the year prior to entry rather than less frequent infections over a longer period. At the time of our original review we felt that this imbalance may make interpretation of the results problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1999</LINK>). However, in his response to our review (see '<LINK TAG="FEEDBACK" TYPE="SECTION">Feedback</LINK>' below), Professor Paradise indicates that a number of children met more than one of the frequency-related eligibility criteria (seven or more episodes per year for one year, or five per year for two years, or three per year for three years) and that such children were categorised as meeting the criterion involving the largest number of episodes. It seems that by chance more children in the surgical rather than the control group met the seven plus episodes per year for one year criterion. We stated in the original review that "The surgical group may therefore have included children with more severe disease" and we still believe that this is a possibility. However, as Professor Paradise points out, the resulting bias would favour control subjects and result in a potential underestimation of the treatment effect. We went on to say "Alternatively, these [the children entered because of seven plus episodes in one year] may have been children with less severe, but more short-lived disease in whom a period of frequent infections is more likely to be followed by spontaneous resolution than in those with longer more chronic histories". We accept the observation that some of these children may also have had episodes in previous years, but would continue to argue that our own comment is not counterintuitive. There may be a difference between those children who have a short, relatively brief, period with many sore throats in whom spontaneous resolution then occurs, and those who experience several sore throats per year for many years. A second baseline imbalance was noted. The children in the non-surgical group were more likely to have parents with higher socio-economic status than those in the surgical group. Professor Paradise argues that this difference is likely to favour the control group and again lead to an underestimation of any treatment effect.</P>

<P>None of the included trials performed blinding of trial participants due to the nature of the intervention and control treatment. In one trial, researchers who conducted interviews or processed self completed questionnaires/diaries were blind to the interventions of trial participants (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>). As the main outcomes of the studies were reported by patients (mostly using patient diaries), there was a risk of detection bias.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-17 11:45:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials reported the numbers of participants who failed to complete the trial and the number of patients excluded.</P>
<P>In seven of the eight included trials intention-to-treat analysis was performed - all patients were analysed according to the group to which they were randomised. In one trial, children in the control group who elected to have surgery and those that did not complete the whole follow-up period were excluded from analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In four of the five trials on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy in children, we judged the risk of attrition bias to be high due to the large number of participants lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>). In one study, the trial was stopped at a fixed time period (<LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>). Although the loss to follow-up in this trial was relatively low, only about half of the children were enrolled at a time point which allowed them to complete a two-year follow-up period.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> trial, loss of participants to follow-up at the end of the first and second years was not the only potential source of significant attrition bias. For individual participants, the data sets were incomplete. Data were collected using monthly diaries and self completed postal questionnaires. The mean number of diaries returned per child in the trial was 9.91 out of 24. As a result, it is difficult to work out how the outcome data relating to "mean number of episodes of sore throat per month" or "mean days of sore throat" were calculated. The study reported that the mean episodes and days with sore throat outcomes were estimated by taking the average of the numbers reported per (four-week) diary returned and multiplying that by 26 to get the rate over two years. It is possible that the diaries were missing in a non-random manner (differential missing rate), introducing a significant risk of bias. The study report noted that there was a possible overestimation of the number of episodes and days with sore throat. When the study authors adjusted for the number of diaries a child returned, the weighted mean number of sore throats decreased over two years from 11.4 to 9.0 for the control group and from 7.4 to 5.5 in the surgery group. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of inclusion of these trial data in the analysis.</P>
<P>There were a large number of missing data sets in the second and third years of the trials and a large proportion of patients receiving surgery (see <LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>), therefore we only included data from the first 12 months of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>).

<P>In studies where patients were analysed according to the groups to which they were randomised, the percentage of patients in the control arm receiving surgery within the first year of randomisation ranged from 6% and 8% (as above) to 15% in the Paradise studies within the first year of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>).

<P>As baseline severity and frequency of tonsillitis could be factors that affect the results, we analysed the data for children as two subgroups: 'severely affected patients' (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>) and 'moderately affected patients' (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The individual results of the seven trials are summarised in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus no surgery</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was measured in two ways in the trials. Some trials only reported episodes of sore throat of <U>any</U> severity, whereas others also reported episodes of '<U>moderate/severe</U>' sore throat.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in children</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Episodes of sore throat of any severity</HEADING>
<P>The first analysis demonstrates the number of episodes of sore throat of any severity <U>including</U> the immediate postoperative period (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In this instance we analysed the data using the random-effects model because of the presence of substantial statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 57%). Surgery is associated with 0.6 fewer sore throat episodes of any severity (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.0 to -0.1 episodes). Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of <I>any</I> severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group. The 'predicable' episode of pain immediately following surgery is, however, important in interpreting this figure as this accounts for one of the three episodes in the surgical group.</P>
<P>We consider the evidence to be of moderate quality, due to lack of standardised methods or definitions in reporting or measuring episodes of sore throat in these studies (which are unblinded) and some uncertainty due to missing data.</P>
<P>Tests for subgroup differences did not show a significant difference between the more severely affected patients and those moderately affected (P value = 0.56, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). We identified one study as at a high risk of bias for this outcome, due to high proportion of missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>). We tested the impact of this study in a sensitivity analysis. Removing this study did not have much impact on the effect size (mean difference (MD) -0.42, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.02) or heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Episodes of moderate/severe sore throat</HEADING>
<P>In this analysis, the test for subgroup differences between the more severely affected patients and those moderately affected was statistically significant (P value = 0.0003) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), therefore we did not pool the subgroups.</P>
<P>Children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group; a small difference of 0.1 episodes (95% 0.6 fewer to 0.4 more) (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. There may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one 'predictable' episode of pain lasting several days following surgery. We considered the results to be of low quality as they came from one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) and there were more missing data/excluded patients in the control group.</P>
<P>Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes): a difference of 0.8 episodes (95% CI 0.7 to 0.9 episodes), but again one episode was the postoperative episode. We rated the evidence as moderate quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in adults</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Episodes of sore throat of any severity</HEADING>
<P>There was substantial statistical heterogeneity in this analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 94%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and we analysed the results using the random-effects model. There were 3.6 fewer episodes in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery (95% 7.9 fewer to 0.7 more). We rated this evidence as low quality because of the short duration of follow-up (indirectness of evidence) and inconsistency. The difference in effect sizes reported by the two studies is substantial; the reduction was 1.5 fewer episodes (95% CI 2.3 fewer to 0.7 fewer) in <LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> and 5.9 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.8 fewer to 0.7 fewer) in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>. When interpreting these findings, it should be noted that the episode of sore throat following surgery has not been included in this analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Episodes of moderate/severe sore throat</HEADING>
<P>The two studies in adults did not distinguish between types of sore throat in ways that were comparable with the studies performed in children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Number of days with sore throat</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in children</HEADING>
<P>In the meta-analysis on sore throat days, the number of sore throat days is about five days less in the surgical group (-5.1 days, 95% CI -8.1 to -2.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The number of days with pain after surgery has been included in this analysis. Therefore the clinical correlate of this is that rather than having about 23 days of sore throat in the year, children receiving surgery had 18 days of sore throat, of which some (between five and seven on average) were immediately following surgery and, as such, entirely predictable. There was some statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43%), but this was reduced if data from <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> were excluded from the analysis (then the I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value = 0.59). We previously noted that this study had a high risk of bias in overestimating the number of days and episodes of sore throat due to the high percentage of missing data. Removing <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> from the analysis reduced the mean difference by about one day to 4.3 days (difference -4.3 days, 95% CI -8.0 to -1.3). Due to these concerns, and the absence of blinding, we considered the evidence to be of moderate quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in adults</HEADING>
<P>Unlike the studies in children, the studies in adults did not include the number of days post-surgery in their analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). There was significant statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 85%) and we analysed the results using the random-effects model. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat for about six months of follow-up was 10.6 days fewer in the group receiving surgery (95% CI -15.5 to -5.8). The difference in the effect sizes reported by the two studies is substantial; the reduction in mean number of days with pain varied from 8.9 days fewer (95% CI -14.0 to -3.9) in <LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> to 35.1 days fewer (95% CI -54.0 to -16.2) in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>. As previously noted, the number of days with sore throat in the immediate postoperative periods is not taken into account in this analysis, which appeared to be 13 (standard deviation (SD) 4) days in <LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK> and 17 (SD 6) days in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>. In addition, the data in <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> are potentially skewed (large standard deviations observed). We considered the evidence for this outcome to be low quality due to these concerns.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Morbidity and mortality of surgery</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies listed mortality as an outcome and none reported any deaths in the description of complications arising from surgery.</P>
<P>None of the studies clearly stated which outcomes related to morbidity or complications would be measured in the trials (apart from the number of days with sore throat following surgery). Tonsillectomy is a painful procedure: the days with postoperative pain might reasonably be considered clinically significant. These were already included in the analysis of days of sore throat for children (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), but not for adults (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For children, the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> trial reports a mean figure for the number of days of pain after surgery as 4.9 days. In the later studies a mean of 6.3 days is given, with a wide range from 0 to 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the two trials in adults (aged 13 years and older) (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>), the mean duration of continuous throat pain following surgery was 13 days (SD 4) and 17 days (SD 6), respectively.</P>
<P>Complications reported in the included studies are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In four studies in children primary bleeding was reported in 1.5% to 4.8%, while secondary bleeding was reported in 4.3% and 6% in the two studies in adults.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Consumption of antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies specifically reported on antibiotic prescriptions or consumption of antibiotics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Consumption of analgesics</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported data for analgesics consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>). The mean number of drugs prescribed was two per patient over two years (SD 3.1) in the surgical arm (n = 120) and two (SD 2.6) in the control arm (n = 115).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Absence or time off work or school</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in children</HEADING>
<P>The results of combining all those children undergoing surgery (tonsillectomy and/or adenotonsillectomy) versus (initial) non-surgical treatment across all studies with follow-up for one year are reported in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. Children who had surgery had 2.3 fewer days (95% CI -3.4 to -1.2) of absence from school compared to an average of six days of absence among children in the control group. We considered this evidence to be of moderate quality. However, the days off school immediately following surgery are <U>not</U> included in this analysis (and data in '3. Morbidity and mortality of surgery' above indicate this period to amount to five to six days on average).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies conducted in adults</HEADING>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK> reported on this outcome. Absenteeism was 3.3 days lower in the surgery arm, but this was not significant (95% CI -7.7 to 1.1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Three studies collected quality of life data, but these unfortunately could not be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> collected data at three months, 12 months and 24 months using the parent form of PedsQoL (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory). The amount of missing data at 12 months was significant; only 64% of participants (71/111) in the surgery arm and 48% of participants (52/108) in the control arm returned the PedsQoL questionnaire.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> collected data for health-related quality of life using the TNO-AZL (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research Academic Medical Centre) Preschool Children's Quality Of Life Questionnaire (TAPQoL) for children aged two to five or the TNO-AZL Children's Quality Of Life Questionnaire (TACQoL) for children aged five years and older and the Child Heath Questionnaire - Parental Form (CHQ pf50). The study reported that small differences were found in some domains of the quality of life questionnaires at six months but these were "not clinically relevant". No differences were found in the other domains or at 24 months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tonsillectomy versus adenotonsillectomy</HEADING>
<P>Data from the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK> study allowed direct comparison between tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy. No significant differences were found in either the number of episodes of sore throat or sore throat days. As reported above, in an earlier trial results from those children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy were combined because no differences between the groups were observed (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update we undertook an appropriate sensitivity analysis by analysing these as subgroups. We did not observe any heterogeneity in treatment effects between different types of surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), but this should be interpreted with caution as this analysis may not be powered to detect small differences, and it is possible that such differences could be masked by other forms of clinical heterogeneity present between studies.</P>
<P>Overall, we may never know whether the absence of evidence of a difference between the effects of the procedures is because no such difference exists, or is due to a lack of statistical power to detect a difference. There remains doubt about whether or not removing the adenoids (reducing or preventing as it does the incidence of mouth breathing) has an effect on the frequency and/or severity of sore throats.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of surgery after the first postoperative year</HEADING>
<P>Four of the five included trials suffered from substantial loss to follow-up, especially during the second and third year of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>). As a consequence, good information was only available for the first 12 months.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review we presented data from the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> trial and suggested that it might be possible to draw some tentative conclusions from these data about the effect of tonsillectomy in the second postoperative year. However, having clarified the methods underlying the data (see the individual results section in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), it is not possible to determine what happened to participants specifically in the second year of follow-up. The study does include data from 139 participants who were followed up for 23 months, of whom 80 participants were followed for two years. However, data on the frequency and duration of sore throats during that second year alone are not available. The proportion of the 174 participants who spent 23 months in the trial, who were lost to follow-up, is 20% and therefore similar to the other studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK> only reported the number of patients who "felt" their symptoms were "cured" after 18 months. This is neither a predefined outcome in our analysis protocol, nor one that could be pooled with other studies. Between 18 months and two years after enrollment, 18/20 participants in the surgery group versus 14/20 participants in the antibiotics group felt that their symptoms were "cured" (risk ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.29).</P>

<UL>
<LI>This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We combined data from five trials in children. Those children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of <B>
<I>any</I>
</B> <B>
<I>severity</I>
</B>) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>When we analysed only episodes of <B>
<I>moderate/severe</I>
</B> sore throat, <B>children who had been more <I>severely</I> affected</B> and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Less severely affected</B> <B>children</B> had more episodes of <B>
<I>moderate/severe</I>
</B> sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Data on the number of sore throat days are only available for <B>moderately affected children</B> and are consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Data for <B>adults</B> were only available for analysis for up to five to six months of follow-up. When we pooled data from two studies (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). Again there was significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence from adults to be of low quality.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics.</LI>

<P>In evaluating the data from the available trials of adeno-/tonsillectomy for chronic or recurrent acute tonsillitis or sore throats there are several issues that must be considered.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Only one study examines the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy in severely affected children (children with the so-called 'Paradise criteria' for surgery).</LI>
<LI>Most trials included children with more modest symptoms and disease.</LI>
<LI>It is not possible to determine whether or not the effectiveness of tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy are different.</LI>
<LI>Adequate data are only available to evaluate the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy in children in the first postoperative year due to substantial loss to follow-up in the included trials, especially in the second and third years.</LI>
<LI>Three trials assessed the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults, but only data from the short-term studies (duration of follow-up five to six months) could be pooled. One trial determined the short-term effectiveness of tonsillectomy in one specific subgroup of patients (recurrent episodes of pharyngitis due to group A <I>Streptococcus</I>), while the other trial reported the short-term effectiveness of tonsillectomy in patients with recurrent episodes of pharyngitis of any origin. The trial that reported data up to 24 months was small (40 participants), at high risk of bias and only reported the proportion of patients who "felt cured".</LI>
<LI>There are no trials evaluating the intermediate to long-term effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults (other than one at high risk of bias).</LI>
</UL>
<P>While an adult or child who has had their palatine tonsils removed cannot suffer from tonsillitis they can suffer from sore throats. Unfortunately, the palatine tonsils are just one part of Waldeyer's ring of lymphoid tissue within the pharynx. The aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the tongue base, nasopharynx and within the pharyngeal walls, along with the remaining soft tissues of the pharynx, remain after tonsillectomy. This, at least in part, explains why tonsillectomy is not a panacea for all sore throats. Patients with chronic or recurrent acute sore throats are heterogeneous in terms of both causation and severity. Some have symptoms primarily due to infection of the tonsils, others do not. Thus an important issue is the role the palatine tonsils play in producing the clinical condition of 'tonsillitis', or indeed 'sore throat' or 'throat infection'. It is self evident that removal of the palatine tonsils will prevent 'tonsillitis' just as removing the appendix will prevent appendicitis. However, many patients with 'tonsillitis' will have inflammation, or infection, of other pharyngeal lymphoid tissue and other soft tissues of this region. If inflammation/infection of these tissues is critically dependent on inflammation/infection of the tonsils themselves, tonsillectomy might be effective. If inflammation/infection of non-tonsillar tissue is independent of tonsillar infection, removing the tonsils may be irrelevant.</P>

<P>The studies provide limited information on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy in certain types of children. While some of the children probably suffered from a clinical condition in which the palatine tonsils played a major (perhaps exclusive) role in the pathogenesis of their symptoms and signs, others might have been included in whom the palatine tonsils were not the source of their symptoms. In his initial study, Paradise tried extremely hard to identify children who fell into the first group (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>). As a result the 'Paradise criteria' have become widely recognised as a standard set of criteria for children with severe throat symptoms due to tonsillar disease in whom tonsillectomy is being considered.</P>
<P>Equally, when following up children post-randomisation, Paradise had strict criteria for episodes of throat infection. The later Paradise studies specifically looked at less severely affected children and it is certainly possible that this group included children in whom the palatine tonsils played a less important role in their symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> trial is unique because the eligibility criteria were much broader. Any child whose ENT surgeon felt they should undergo adeno-/tonsillectomy was potentially eligible. Those fulfilling the 'Paradise criteria' were excluded, leaving as the included group children who might have been similar to the Paradise (2002) 'less severely affected' children (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>). However, equally, some children may have fulfilled even less stringent criteria. To reiterate, these were children who ENT surgeons working in 21 general hospitals and three academic centres in the Netherlands had deemed fulfilled their normal criteria for surgery. Whilst specific information on the nature and severity of sore throats prior to randomisation is lacking in the <LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> trial, no such criticism can be made of the follow-up period. A sore throat was defined as sore throat or pain or difficulty in swallowing combined, with or without a fever. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> initially included both children experiencing mild symptoms (six or more episodes within two years or eight or more episodes within one year) and moderate symptoms (sore throat for five days or more: six or more episodes within two years or six or more within one year). These stringent criteria were, however, amended midway through the study and the inclusion criteria were changed to include children experiencing four or more episodes of sore throat within each of two years or six or more episodes of sore throat within one year. As a consequence the entry criteria for inclusion in this trial were less stringent than those of <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>.</P>
<P>In summary, what the included studies actually evaluate is the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy for the symptoms experienced by three more or less heterogeneous groups of children, and these studies themselves are heterogeneous.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> many (possibly most) included children had symptoms related to their palatine tonsils so this group is likely to be least heterogeneous.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> had a heterogeneous group of less severely affected children. What proportion had symptoms related to their palatine tonsils?</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Staaij-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Staaij 2004</LINK> had potentially the most heterogeneous group of less severely affected children. Again, the proportion with symptoms related to their palatine tonsils is uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Is it, therefore, rational to combine the studies given the clinical heterogeneity among the included study populations of the trials? Combining results would probably lead to an underestimate of a positive treatment effect from surgery in the most severely affected children and an overestimate in the least severely affected.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Severely affected children</HEADING>
<P>Is there a positive treatment effect in the most severely affected children? These children from <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> are included in our first meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). In terms of moderate/severe sore throat, the benefit of adeno-/tonsillectomy is exchanging the 1.2 episodes experienced by the control group for 1.1 episodes following surgery at a 'cost' of the one episode following surgery, which means the children had only an average of 0.1 fewer episodes. The postoperative episode might be thought to be preferable because it can be timed and anticipated. However, this is at best a modest benefit and, given the width of the confidence interval (95% CI 0.6 fewer to 0.4 more), the true value may be even less. The commensurate reduction in any type of sore throat was 0.9 episodes (3.1 versus 2.2 (= 1.2 + 1 episode post-surgery)). No significant reduction was found in terms of number of sore throat days in the first year (18.9 in the control group versus 16.3 in the adeno-/tonsillectomy group) but (on average) five to seven of these 16.3 days were in the immediate postoperative period and hence highly predictable. Since there are no 'post-surgical days' in later years, one might speculate that had sufficient data been available for the second and third years post-surgery, a difference may have been seen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Less severely affected children</HEADING>
<P>As might be expected, the benefits seen in the less severely affected children are less (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), with a <U>increase</U> in <I>moderate or severe</I> sore throat episodes of 0.8, and a decrease of <I>any</I> sore throat of 0.5, if the episode of pain due to surgery is taken into account. In this analysis there was a statistically significant reduction in sore throat days from 24 to 18 days. That period of 18 days includes the predictable five to seven days of pain in the immediate postoperative period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effects in the second year post-surgery</HEADING>
<P>Little useful information is available about the effects of surgery in the second postoperative year and beyond.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adults</HEADING>
<P>Two trials examined the short-term effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>). One trial focused on a specific subgroup of patients (recurrent episodes of pharyngitis due to group A <I>Streptococcus</I>), while the other trial included patients with recurrent episodes of pharyngitis from any origin. Although both studies suggest that tonsillectomy offers short-term benefits as compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment, the limited duration of follow-up prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. We must conclude that we do not know, one way or the other, whether tonsillectomy is generally helpful for adults suffering from sore throats in the intermediate or long term. If we could be certain that (a) the symptoms were solely attributable to inflammation of their tonsils, and (b) these symptoms were going to continue, then tonsillectomy would be a reasonable treatment option. It is difficult (if not impossible) to be certain that both of these conditions are true for an individual patient. Although a third trial reported percentages of people who "felt cured", the trial had many limitations and the effect size observed was not significant.</P>

<P>We judged the evidence for the primary outcomes for children's data to be of moderate quality; we downgraded the evidence from high quality mainly due to the high number of losses to follow-up that introduced a substantial risk of (attrition) bias, especially beyond one year after surgery, and also due to inconsistencies in the data collection.</P>
<P>Most of the evidence is derived from trials in children and there is a lack of data for adults, particularly after six months of follow-up. There was also significant heterogeneity observed in the data for adults. Therefore, the quality of evidence for the main outcomes for adults is low.</P>

<P>The outcome definitions and methods of data collection were different between studies, introducing some clinical heterogeneity. However, we did standardise the definition of key outcomes such as (refraining from) including the number of days and episodes of sore throat post-surgery in the meta-analyses. There was also a concern about potential skewness from the use of count data for episodes of sore throat.</P>

<P>Our main results are in agreement with findings reported in a recent (narrative) systematic review on the effects of tonsillectomy for recurrent sore throats in children (<LINK REF="REF-Barraclough-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barraclough 2014</LINK>), and with current clinical practice guidelines on tonsillectomy for children and adults with recurrent sore throats (<LINK REF="REF-Baugh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baugh 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The information about complications provided by the studies included in this review is consistent with other published data even though reporting may be incomplete. Relatively small randomised controlled trials are often inadequate for providing accurate data about rare complications. The best available data on primary and secondary haemorrhage following tonsillectomy are provided by the United Kingdom National Tonsillectomy Audit (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2005</LINK>); the primary and secondary haemorrhage rates were 0.6% and 3%, respectively, in a group of 33,921 patients who underwent tonsillectomy over a 14-month period in 2003 and 2004.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-17 12:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and a shorter period (five to six months following surgery) in adults.</P>
<P>For more <B>severely affected children</B> (those who fulfil the 'Paradise criteria'), those who have an adeno-/tonsillectomy will have a significant, but predictable episode of sore throat immediately following surgery and then two other episodes in the first postoperative year (1 predictable + 2 unpredictable = 3 in total) compared with 3.6 unpredictable episodes in the control group. The difference is 0.6 episodes, but with a confidence interval of -1 to -0.1; in other words, the real difference may be one episode or almost none. In practical terms, this difference is modest.</P>
<P>
<B>Less severely affected children </B>who have adeno-/tonsillectomy may never have had another <I>moderate</I>/<I>severe</I> sore throat anyway; the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of 1.2 moderate/severe sore throats (1 predictable + 0.2 unpredictable = 1.2 in total) rather than 0.4 unpredictable episodes experienced by the control group. If the postoperative episode is set aside (and this may not be a reasonable thing to do), there is no difference in the number of unpredictable episodes of moderate/severe sore throat. The children who have surgery will have 18 rather than 23 sore throat days but something between five to seven (on average) of these 18 days will be in the immediate postoperative period.</P>
<P>Current evidence suggests that in adults with recurrent episodes of pharyngitis tonsillectomy may not lead to a clinically significant reduction in the number of sore throat episodes and sore throat days in the first five to six months following surgery as compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment.</P>
<P>The very modest benefits that have been identified should be carefully weighed against the possible harms of surgery, as the procedure is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Questions related to the natural history of recurrent/chronic tonsillitis/'sore throat'</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest is that many patients in the control group get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient, who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties. These are:</P>
<P>
<B>Uncertainty 1</B>: Are my symptoms primarily attributable to disease of my palatine tonsils?</P>
<P>
<B>Uncertainty 2</B>: Am I going to continue to have sore throats and, if so, will they be as bad, better or worse?</P>
<P>
<B>Decision</B>: Do I want to exchange the uncertainties of both the possibility and timing of my sore throats, in the year ahead, for the certainty of a predictable period of postoperative pain that may be followed by fewer sore throats than I might have had?</P>
<P>Many thousands of patients have undergone adeno-/tonsillectomy and are likely to continue to do so. Some will undergo this surgery 'unnecessarily' because they would not have had any further throat problems had they not had surgery. During a period in the 1980s and 1990s in the United Kingdom, when waiting lists for surgery were long, a proportion of patients who were listed for surgery according to strict criteria eventually declined the operation because they had improved spontaneously. Perhaps the price society pays for the prevention of recurrent sore throats in one group of patients is that for each of these individuals an indeterminable number of other individuals will have their tonsils removed 'unnecessarily'.</P>
<P>Those who choose surgery for themselves or their child must be fully informed of the risks of the procedure; this is critical in conducting the appropriate harm-benefit analysis. Evidence from the included studies confirms that primary and secondary haemorrhages are still significant complications. Even more robust data are provided by the United Kingdom National Tonsillectomy Audit, undertaken between 2003 and 2004. The audit collected information from 33,921 patients undergoing tonsillectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2005</LINK>). Overall the rates of primary and secondary haemorrhage were 0.6% and 3%, respectively; the rates varied according to the surgical technique used to remove the tonsils.</P>
<P>Those considering tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for themselves or their children, as a treatment for chronic or recurrent acute tonsillitis, and those advising them, should be aware of two important uncertainties that may affect their treatment decisions. They must acknowledge some uncertainty about whether or not their symptoms are primarily due to their tonsils and realise that adeno-/tonsillectomy is not a panacea for all types of sore throat.There is also uncertainty about the likelihood that these will continue in the future, which is only partly predictable from the frequency and severity of symptoms they have experienced in the past.</P>
<P>The benefits of surgery are greatest in children fulfilling the 'Paradise criteria'. In their original setting these were very strict, requiring a child to have had each of the following: (1) seven or more episodes in the preceding year, or five or more in each of the preceding two years, or three or more in each of the preceding three years, comprising (2) characteristic clinical features, having been (3) treated with antibiotics when streptococcal infection was proven or suspected, and (4) each episode had to have been be documented in a clinical record.In day-to-day practice these criteria are often 'watered down', with most emphasis being placed on the aspect of 'counting' the number of episodes, and less on proving the 'certainty' of each episode.</P>
<P>Surgery is associated with a reduction in the number of unpredictable days with sore throat and the number of episodes of sore throat even in those who are less severely affected. One of the key practical issues is that the episode of a period of days with sore throat that follows surgery is entirely predictable, lasting between about five and seven days on average, but in some cases being shorter and in others considerably longer. These benefits should be carefully weighed against the possible harms of surgery as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults. It may have to be accepted that some patients will undergo 'unnecessary surgery' in order for others to benefit, and that even well-informed and appropriately counselled patients are prepared to accept the risks and uncertainty of surgery.</P>

<P>One implication drawn from the trials is that greater benefit can potentially be obtained by more severely affected children.

If the most severely affected adults could be identified, would a randomised trial, looking at outcomes over several years, be appropriate or practicable?</P>

<P>At least one year and preferably two or three years.</P>
<P>There would be little need to consider further studies to evaluate the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy if three things were certain. Firstly, that an individual's throat problems were entirely due to their tonsils, secondly that these problems were bound to disappear if they had surgery, and finally that they would definitely continue if they did not have surgery. There would certainly be no need for a randomised trial. Two appropriate research questions therefore might be:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is it possible to identify those individuals in whom the presence of the palatine tonsils is a critical determinant of their clinical condition?</LI>
<LI>Is it possible to better predict which individuals will continue to have problems and to predict the severity of those problems?</LI>
</OL>
<P>It is unlikely to be easy, and may not be possible, to address these uncertainties.</P>

<P>The original protocol for this review was titled 'Tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis'. The title was changed to include adenotonsillectomy when the first version of the full review was published. This reflected a change of scope which paralleled both day-to-day clinical practice and the interventions studied by the available studies. This is commented upon in the text of the review. The most important difference between the current version of the review and the previous one, <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2009</LINK>, is the inclusion of three additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-Koskenkorva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koskenkorva 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1986</LINK>). The general conclusions and recommendations regarding the effects of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus (initial) non-surgical treatment in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis on the number of any sore throat episodes, the number of moderate or severe sore throat episodes and the number of days with sore throat remained unchanged.</P>

<P>Data on number of episodes and days with sore throat were collected through diaries. Given the loss of participants and outcome data, it was unclear how the following was estimated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>"mean number of episodes of sore throat per month" at end of Year 1 and Year 2 (Table 12 of <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>)</LI>

<LI>"mean days of sore throat in Year 1 and Year 2" (Table 17 of <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The number of episodes and days with sore throat pain over 2 years seemed to be estimated by taking the mean number of sore throat per (4-week) diary returned multiplied by 26. However, the numbers in Table 17 of <LINK REF="STD-Lock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lock 2010</LINK> do not seem to be completely consistent with the application of this method</P>
<UL>
<LI>The average number of diaries returned per child was 9.91, out of 24 4-weekly diaries sent (page 11). The proportion of diaries returned per child was low (9.91/24 = 41%)</LI>
<LI>Imputations were done for missing data for the non-returned diaries, but the data could have been missing in a non-random manner; e.g. patients may be more likely to return a diary that has been filled in when they were symptomatic</LI>
<LI>The study report noted that there was a possible overestimation of the number of episodes and days with sore throat. When adjusted for the number of diaries a child returned, the weighted mean number of sore throats decreased from 11.4 to 9.0 in the medical group and 7.4 to 5.5 in the surgery group over 2 years</LI>

<P>
<B>Editor's note:</B> These comments relate to the original (1999) version of the review.</P>
<P>In a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1999</LINK>) critiquing our randomized clinical trial of tonsillectomy in severely affected children (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>), Burton, Towler, and Glasziou concluded that "significant baseline differences (in the history of antecedent throat infections and in parents' socioeconomic status) between the surgical and non-surgical groups and the inclusion of children who also underwent adenoidectomy prevent firm conclusions being drawn from the . . . trial." However, the Burton review fails to take into account a number of study features and findings that argue strongly against the importance of these factors as potential invalidators of our trial results.</P>
<P>First, consider the large differences in key outcomes favoring surgical over control subjects: in the first follow-up year a 14-fold reduction in throat infection episodes rated as moderate or severe (3 episodes in 38 surgical subjects vs 41 episodes in 35 control subjects), and in the second follow-up year, a 6-fold reduction (5 episodes in 31 surgical subjects vs 30 episodes in 29 control subjects). Other outcome differences were less dramatic but consistently in the same direction and also significant statistically.</P>
<P>Second, as we reported, tests for interaction albeit their limited power showed no significant differences in treatment outcomes that were related to any of the three factors cited by Burton et al (i.e. history of antecedent episodes, socioeconomic status, and presence or absence of indications for adenoidectomy), nor were any of these factors related significantly to outcomes within the control group. Imbalances in factors that are not prognostic cannot fairly be considered sources of bias. Moreover, as we also reported, within each identifiable clinical and sociodemographic subgroup rates of throat infection were, without exception, lower for subjects treated surgically than for controls.</P>
<P>Third, consider the differences in antecedent history, which in any case may have been more apparent than real. Eligibility for our trial required a history of seven or more episodes of throat infection in the preceding year, five or more in each of the two preceding years, or three or more in each of the three preceding years. Not stated in our report were the facts that a number of children met more than one of these criteria and that such children were categorized as meeting the criterion involving the largest number of episodes. As chance would have it, more children in the surgical group than in the control group (20/43 vs 11/48) met the criterion of seven or more episodes in the preceding year. From this, Burton et al concluded that "the surgical group may therefore have included children with more severe disease," or "alternatively, these may have been children with less severe, but more short-lived disease." Setting aside for a moment that the analyses cited above argue against any prognostically important differences in disease severity, if the surgical group did indeed include children with more severe disease, the resulting bias would have favored control subjects rather than surgical subjects, in which case trial results would have understated, not overstated, the efficacy of surgery. Burton et al advance no rationale for their contrary, counterintuitive speculation that such children might actually have had less severe disease, but even if that had been the case the imbalance would hardly seem sufficient to account for the large differences in outcome.</P>
<P>Fourth, the difference in socioeconomic status referred to by Burton et al favored the control group rather than the surgical group. Again setting aside that the analyses cited above argued against the possibility that the difference was important prognostically, any resulting bias again might be expected to have favored control subjects, not surgical subjects.</P>
<P>In summary, to explain the large outcome differences we found favoring the surgical group on the basis of confounding would have required extreme imbalances between the surgical and control groups in variables that were strongly prognostic. In fact, however, not only were the variables of concern not apparently prognostic and their imbalances limited, but further, the expected effect of the imbalances would have been to favour the control group.</P>
<P>Finally, with regard to the adenoidectomy issue, Burton et al suggest that "Some part--potentially the greatest part--of the effect of 'surgery' could be due to removal of the adenoids." On the contrary--and again apart from the analyses described above--the addition of adenoidectomy in a minority of the surgically treated subjects could certainly not have accounted for the fact that moderate and severe throat-infection episodes were also virtually eliminated in the majority of such subjects who underwent tonsillectomy only.</P>
<P>We stand by our conclusion that in these severely affected children, tonsillectomy was unequivocally efficacious in reducing the occurrence of throat infection.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study 1: Paradise 1984</HEADING>
<P>The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> trial are based on surgical intervention in 43 severely affected children compared to 48 control subjects. Of those having surgery, 27 underwent tonsillectomy alone and 16 adenotonsillectomy; the results for the two procedures are pooled and inseparable.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">A: Episodes of sore throat of any severity</HEADING>
<P>For the mean number of episodes of sore throats of any severity within 12 months the results are:</P>
<TABLE COLS="2" ROWS="2">
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Adeno-/tonsillectomy group (n = 38)</P>

<P>Control group (n = 35)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>3.1 episodes (SD 2.64)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>However, we had to assume that the data had not included the episode post-surgery and, therefore, the number of episodes of sore throat in the surgery group should be 2.2 episodes (SD 1.62).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">B: Episodes of moderate/severe sore throat</HEADING>
<P>The numbers of moderate or severe sore throats in the first year of the trial were as follows:</P>
<TABLE COLS="2" ROWS="2">
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Adeno-/tonsillectomy group (n = 38)</P>

<TD>
<P>Control group (n = 35)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>1.2 episodes (SD 1.42)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>We must <B>assume</B> that the data for the surgical groups cannot include the immediate postoperative period as one episode of sore throat (because if they did, the mean in the surgical group would have to be &gt; 1). Therefore, the number of episodes of moderate to severe sore throat should be 1.1 (SD 0.27) in the surgery group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">C: Sore throat days (including those immediately following surgery)</HEADING>
<P>Data on the number of sore throat days in the surgical and control groups are only available for 31 and 33 children respectively (72% and 69% of those enrolled) (see <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>, Table 5). Here sore throat days immediately after surgery <U>are</U> included and "the number of days for each subject for each follow-up year was standardised on the basis of 365 days". Data on the mean number of sore throat days are as follows:</P>
<TABLE COLS="2" ROWS="2">
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Adeno-/tonsillectomy group (n = 31)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>16.3 days (SD 14.3)</P>

<TD>
<P>Control group (n = 33)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>18.9 days (SD 14.6)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>The number of days with sore throat postoperatively varies considerably. In the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> trial a mean figure of 4.9 days is reported. In the later studies there is a mean of 6.3 days with a wide range from 0 to 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that despite the fact that the trial included only children who were severely affected by throat infections, following enrolment in the trial many of those in the control (non-operated) group had few episodes of infection and these few were usually mild. Of the 48 children in the original control group, seven (15%) had elected to have surgery before the end of the first year and were excluded from analysis. Another six children were excluded because of loss to follow-up (n = 4) or not completing the whole 12-month period (n = 2). Of the 35 remaining children, however, 26 (74% of that group; 54% of the whole control group) had either a single episode of moderate or severe sore throat or none at all.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events associated with surgery</HEADING>
<P>Of the 95 children treated with surgery (children of the randomised and non-randomised studies combined), 13 (14%) had surgery-related complications and six of them (46% of the children that suffered from surgery-related complications; 6% of the children treated with surgery) required one or more extra days in the hospital. The primary and secondary haemorrhage rates were both 2%, of which none required transfusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study 2: Paradise 2002a</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK> trials, the authors present their results in a slightly different way. Data are presented for the number of episodes in the first 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>, Table 2). However, the mean number of episodes and the range is given, along with the 95% confidence interval for the mean. For the purposes of this review, the standard deviation of the mean has had to be imputed, by dividing the confidence interval by four and multiplying by the &#8730;(N-1), where N is the number of subjects in the relevant group.</P>
<P>The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK> trial are based on surgical intervention in 117 children less severely affected than those included in <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK> (tonsillectomy: 58 children; adenotonsillectomy: 59 children) compared to 60 control subjects. Results for the two procedures are presented separately. The results are presented as the mean number of episodes and sore throat days with accompanying standard deviations.</P>

<P>However, we noted that the number of episodes was unlikely to include the episode of pain due to the surgery.

</TABLE>
<P>The data for the surgical groups cannot include the immediate postoperative period as one episode of sore throat (see above). The clinical interpretation therefore must be that the 'benefit' of avoiding 0.9 episodes of any sore throat is offset by the episode of sore throat attributable to the surgery, whilst there was no benefit in terms of a reduction in the number of episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after the immediate postoperative period, despite having experienced the postoperative episode of pain that naturally follows the surgery. To include the episode of pain due to surgery in the analysis, the number of episodes of moderate or severe sore throat was considered as 1.2 (SD 0.46) in the tonsillectomy group and 1.1 (SD 0.35) in the adenotonsillectomy group.</P>

<P>The primary outcome measure in this trial was the incidence and duration of fever (temperature of 38.0 C or higher) for at least one day. Secondary outcome measures included throat infections (fever plus sore throat or pain or difficulty swallowing) and sore throats (sore throat or pain or difficulty swallowing with or without fever). Data relating to outcomes at 12 months, comparable to those in the Paradise studies (<LINK REF="STD-Paradise-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paradise-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Paradise 2002b</LINK>), are not presented in the paper reporting the results of this trial but have been obtained from the trialists.</P>

<P>In this case, the episode of sore throat following surgery cannot have routinely been included as an episode of 'throat infection' (see above).

<P>To allow a similar comparison with other data, the episode due to surgery should be included. Therefore, the number of episodes of moderate or severe pain should be 1.7 (SD 0.91) in the adenotonsillectomy group.</P>

<P>The study has relatively low loss to follow-up overall. However, not all patients completed two years of follow-up as the study had to stop at a predetermined time point (February 2003). Overall, losses to follow-up were relatively low for this study: 88% (133/151) and 83% (124/149) of the adenotonsillectomy and control groups respectively. However, the study was designed to complete at a predetermined time point (February 2003) and, therefore, not all patients could complete up to 2 years of follow-up.</P>
<P>The authors confirmed that whilst there were 300 randomised participants, 24-month data were only <I>potentially</I> available for a group of 166 who had been in the trial long enough to complete 24 months follow-up. In fact, data were only available for 80 of these 166 participants. Data on the occurrence of sore throats in the second year (months 13 to 24) were not available.</P>
<P>The <I>published</I> data (referring to rates <I>per year</I>) record the incidence of symptoms at a median follow-up interval of 22 months. These are:</P>
