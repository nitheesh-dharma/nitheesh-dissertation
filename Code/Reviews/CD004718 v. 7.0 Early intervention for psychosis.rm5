<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:38:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia typically begins in young adulthood and may lead to disability that lasts a lifetime. The onset of psychosis is usually preceded by a period of non-psychotic symptoms, known as prodromal symptoms. The symptoms of full-blown schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and emotional withdrawal. There is some evidence that a delay in receiving adequate treatment reduces the chances or the extent of recovery.</P>
<P>In broad terms, early intervention has two objectives: the first is to prevent the onset of schizophrenia in people with prodromal symptoms; the second is to provide effective treatment to people in the early stages of schizophrenia, with the goal of reducing the ultimate severity of the illness.<B> </B>Early intervention services are now widespread in America, Europe and Australia.</P>
<P>We sought to review all trials that involved early intervention for people with prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of psychosis. We identified 18 studies, most were underpowered and at present we have insufficient data to draw any definitive conclusions, although further trials are expected.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:33:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proponents of early intervention have argued that outcomes might be improved if more therapeutic efforts were focused on the early stages of schizophrenia or on people with prodromal symptoms. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection, and phase-specific treatment (phase-specific treatment is a psychological, social or physical treatment developed, or modified, specifically for use with people at an early stage of the illness).</P>
<P>Early detection and phase-specific treatment may both be offered as supplements to standard care, or may be provided through a specialised early intervention team. Early intervention is now well established as a therapeutic approach in America, Europe and Australasia.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-03-04 22:39:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effects of: (a) early detection; (b) phase-specific treatments; and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first-episode psychosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-11-17 16:13:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2009), inspected reference lists of all identified trials and reviews and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-03-04 22:39:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to prevent progression to psychosis in people showing prodromal symptoms, or to improve outcome for people with first-episode psychosis. Eligible interventions, alone and in combination, included: early detection, phase-specific treatments, and care from specialised early intervention teams. We accepted cluster-randomised trials but excluded non-randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-10 16:17:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were diverse, mostly small, undertaken by pioneering researchers and with many methodological limitations (18 RCTs, total n=1808). Mostly, meta-analyses were inappropriate. For the six studies addressing prevention of psychosis for people with prodromal symptoms, olanzapine seemed of little benefit (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.2), and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) equally so (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.50 CI 0.2 to 1.7). A risperidone plus CBT plus specialised team did have benefit over specialist team alone at six months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 2 to 20), but this was not seen by 12 months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR 0.54 CI 0.2 to 1.3). Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) had advantage over placebo (n=76, 1 RCT, RR transition to psychosis 0.13 CI 0.02 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 96). We know of no replications of this finding.</P>
<P>The remaining trials aimed to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis. Phase-specific CBT for suicidality seemed to have little effect, but the single study was small (n=56, 1 RCT, RR suicide 0.81 CI 0.05 to 12.26). Family therapy plus a specialised team in the Netherlands did not clearly affect relapse (n=76, RR 1.05 CI 0.4 to 3.0), but without the specialised team in China it may (n=83, 1 RCT, RR admitted to hospital 0.28 CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6). The largest and highest quality study compared specialised team with standard care. Leaving the study early was reduced (n=547, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNT 9 CI 6 to 18) and compliance with treatment improved (n=507, RR stopped treatment 0.20 CI 0.1 to 0.4, NNT 9 CI 8 to 12). The mean number of days spent in hospital at one year were not significantly different (n=507, WMD, -1.39 CI -2.8 to 0.1), neither were data for 'Not hospitalised' by five years (n=547, RR 1.05 CI 0.90 to 1.2). There were no significant differences in numbers 'not living independently' by one year (n=507, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 1.2). At five years significantly fewer participants in the treatment group were 'not living independently' (n=547, RR 0.42 CI 0.21 to 0.8, NNT 19 CI 14 to 62). When phase-specific treatment (CBT) was compared with befriending no significant differences emerged in the number of participants being hospitalised over the 12 months (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 1.08 CI 0.59 to 1.99).</P>
<P>Phase-specific treatment E-EPA oils suggested no benefit (n=80, 1 RCT, RR no response 0.90 CI 0.6 to 1.4) as did phase-specific treatment brief intervention (n=106, 1 RCT, RR admission 0.86 CI 0.4 to 1.7). Phase-specific ACE found no benefit but participants given vocational intervention were more likely to be employed (n=41, 1 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.21 to 0.7, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). Phase-specific cannabis and psychosis therapy did not show benefit (n=47, RR cannabis use 1.30 CI 0.8 to 2.2) and crisis assessment did not reduce hospitalisation (n=98, RR 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.3). Weight was unaffected by early behavioural intervention.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-19 15:31:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is emerging, but as yet inconclusive evidence, to suggest that people in the prodrome of psychosis can be helped by some interventions. There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase-specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:39:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia and other functional psychoses cause enormous suffering for individuals and their families, and are a financial burden to the NHS and other health services. The estimated total cost of schizophrenia in England was £6.7 billion in 2004/05; the direct cost of treatment and care was £2 billion, whilst the indirect cost to society was £4.7 billion, and the cost of informal care and private expenditure was £615 million (<LINK REF="REF-Mangalore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangalore 2007</LINK>). Despite new medications and the development of community care, about one-third of people with schizophrenia have a poor long-term outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1997</LINK>). An overview of studies investigating outcomes has shown that people with schizophrenia have a one-year relapse rate of 15% to 35%, rising to 80% within five years (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1998</LINK>). Achievement of full remission becomes less likely after each relapse, and about 10% of sufferers eventually commit suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Wiersma-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiersma 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:39:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a chronic, relapsing mental illness and has a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about 1% irrespective of culture, social class and race. Schizophrenia is characterised by positive symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and jumbled thinking; and negative symptoms such as apathy, poverty of speech, and withdrawal from social activities.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:39:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early intervention in psychosis has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection and phase-specific treatment. Early detection may be defined as either the identification of people thought likely to develop psychosis (i.e. those who display prodromal symptoms, but have never been psychotic (<LINK REF="REF-Schaffner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaffner 2001</LINK>)) or the identification of people who are already psychotic, but have not yet received adequate treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phase-specific treatments are defined as treatments (psychological, social or physical) that are especially targeted at people in the prodrome or early stages of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>). Phase-specific treatments may be directed at preventing progression to psychosis (in people with prodromal symptoms), or at promoting recovery (in people who have recently experienced their first episode of psychosis).<BR/>
<BR/>Early detection and phase-specific treatments may be provided as supplements to standard psychiatric care, or they may be provided by means of a specialised early intervention team (<LINK REF="REF-Garety-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garety 2000</LINK>). Such teams provide care exclusively to people who have prodromal symptoms or are in early stages of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prodromal patients are usually assessed by the attenuated psychotic symptom criteria, using either the criteria by <LINK REF="REF-Yung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2005</LINK> or the Scale of Psychotic Symptoms (SOPS, <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>). A second method, is the detection of 'basic symptoms' developed in Germany (<LINK REF="REF-Schultze_x002d_Lutter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultze-Lutter 2007</LINK>). When people are referred to as 'ultra high risk' they are using the <LINK REF="REF-Yung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2005</LINK> criteria. When they are referred to as early or late initial prodrome state, they are using basic symptoms.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-16 09:09:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until recently, the orthodox approach to treating schizophrenia was to concentrate therapeutic resources on those people who developed severe and chronic disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-McGorry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 1999</LINK>). This approach has been challenged by proponents of early intervention, who have argued that greater investment of resources in the early stages of the disorder might substantially reduce the numbers of people developing chronic disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1991</LINK>). This argument has been strengthened by the observation that there may be an association between various outcome parameters and the duration of untreated psychosis (the time from the development of the first psychotic symptom to the receipt of adequate drug treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2001</LINK>). This has led to the proposition that untreated psychosis may be 'toxic' and that early intervention might prevent irreversible harm (<LINK REF="REF-Sheitman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheitman 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-23 11:30:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The arguments in favour of early intervention have been so persuasive that early intervention teams are well-established in America, Europe and Australasia (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>). In 2000, the UK government announced its intention to set up 50 early intervention teams in England to provide specialised care to all young people with a first episode of psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>). It remains unclear, however, how far these service developments are underpinned by evidence of effectiveness. There is particular concern over the ethics of early intervention with prodromal patients, when the benefits of early detection and treatment are unclear, and there is no certainty that they will go on to develop psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2000</LINK>).</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-28 17:41:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effects of early intervention in the treatment of early psychosis.</P>
<P>The two specific objectives were to determine the following.</P>
<P>1. The effects of early detection and treatment of people with 'prodromal' symptoms, in terms of:<BR/>1.1 prevention of progression to full-blown psychosis;<BR/>1.2 clinical and social outcomes;<BR/>1.3 process variables and costs.</P>
<P>2. To determine the effects of early detection and treatment of people in their first episode of psychosis, in terms of:<BR/>2.1 clinical and social outcomes;<BR/>2.2 prevention of relapse;<BR/>2.3 process variables and costs;<BR/>2.4 reduction in duration of untreated psychosis.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>We defined 'Treatment' as including both phase-specific treatments and care from a specialised early intervention team. We are not concerned with evaluating the accuracy of methods of predicting who is likely to develop psychosis.</P>

<P>In broad terms we have included two types of trial in this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Trials to prevent the development of psychosis</HEADING>
<P>These studies involved treatments and/or methods of management that are given to people who are believed to be showing prodromal (pre-psychotic) symptoms and are therefore considered at high risk of developing psychosis. The primary aim of such studies was to prevent progression to psychosis, and invariably the interventions they offered were combined with some method of early detection of people at risk.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis</HEADING>
<P>These studies involved treatments and/or methods of management designed for people in the early stages of psychosis. The primary aim of such studies was to improve the long term outcome. Early detection might be offered in addition to the treatments, with the aim of ensuring that the treatment was offered as early as possible after the onset of psychosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-03-04 22:39:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. For trials to prevent the development of psychosis, we included people who were judged by the trialists to be in a prodromal phase of psychosis, on the basis of showing prodromal symptoms (however defined).</P>
<P>2. For trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis, we included people who were in their first episode of psychosis, or were in the process of recovering from their first episode. People with psychosis were defined as those presenting with any combination of delusions, hallucinations or thought disorder, or those who had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorder, bipolar disorder (manic episode i.e. with psychotic symptoms), or depression with psychotic features.</P>
<P>We excluded trials where the majority of participants were suffering from a learning disability or an organic psychosis. We did not exclude anyone for reasons such as age or type of psychosis (for example, affective psychosis). Where studies included both first and second episode participants, we excluded trials if more than 10% of the participants included in the study had experienced a second episode,</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-04 22:40:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In trials of early intervention there are many possible combinations of intervention and control condition. This depends on: the type of participant (prodromal or first episode); whether the trial involved early detection (which could involve the whole sample or just the treatment group); the type of intervention (phase-specific or specialised team); the nature of any phase-specific treatment (cognitive therapy, family therapy etc); and the type of control (no treatment, standard psychiatric care, care from a specialised team but not phase specific intervention, etc.). In this section the most likely combinations of intervention and control conditions are listed for trials to prevent the development of psychosis and trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Trials to prevent the development of psychosis in prodromal patients</HEADING>
<P>These trials require prodromal patients, and since such patients do not normally present to psychiatric services, the trials therefore require some form of early detection to be applied to the whole sample. The intervention may consist of: phase-specific treatment (medication, psychological treatment or other) or care from a specialised team (which might offer phase-specific treatments). The control condition may consist of no treatment, or standard psychiatric care, or care from a specialised team (in which case the intervention will consist of care from a specialised team plus a phase specific intervention). The various types of intervention and control condition are described in more detail below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Phase-specific treatment</HEADING>
<P>In the context of preventing psychosis, phase-specific treatments are discrete interventions including medication regimes, which have been specifically developed for use in patients experiencing prodromal symptoms. A phase-specific treatment could be offered by an individual therapist or provided in the context of receiving care from a specialised team (see 1.2 below). More than one phase-specific treatment might be offered at the same time (for example, medication regime and cognitive therapy).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2 Care from a specialised team</HEADING>
<P>In the context of preventing psychosis, this is defined as a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team, specialising in the treatment of patients with prodromal symptoms. Such a team would normally provide comprehensive psychiatric care to its patients and would be an alternative, rather than an addition, to standard psychiatric care. In the context of a trial it is likely that any specialised team would also offer phase-specific interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3 Control conditions</HEADING>
<P>In the context of preventing psychosis, the common control conditions are: no treatment; non-specific supportive therapy or care from a specialised team (which did not offer phase-specific treatments to prevent onset of psychosis).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis</HEADING>
<P>The intervention may consist of: early detection; phase-specific treatments (medication, psychological intervention or other) or care from a specialised team (which might offer phase-specific treatments). The control condition may consist of standard psychiatric care or care from a specialised team (in which case the intervention will consist of care from a specialised team plus a phase-specific intervention). A 'no treatment' control group is not an ethically acceptable option in first-episode psychosis trials. The various types of intervention and control condition are described in more detail below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Early detection</HEADING>
<P>In trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis it is possible to use early detection as an intervention applied to the treatment group alone; this is in contrast to the situation in trials designed to prevent psychosis (see 1. above) where early detection must be applied to both treatment and control groups. The theoretical basis for using early detection as an intervention is that shortening the duration of untreated psychosis in itself improves outcome.<B> </B>In trials where early detection is the intervention being tested, the unit of randomisation must be a cluster (for example, general practices or catchment areas), since it is not possible to individually randomise patients who have not yet been diagnosed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Phase-specific treatment</HEADING>
<P>In the context of improving outcome in the first episode, phase-specific treatments are discrete treatments and include medication regimes which have been specifically developed for use in the early stages of psychosis. A phase-specific treatment can be offered by an individual therapist or provided in the context of receiving care from a specialised team<B> </B>(see 2.3 below). More than one phase-specific treatment might be offered at the same time (for example, medication regime and cognitive therapy).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Care from a specialised team</HEADING>
<P>In the context of improving outcome in first episode, this is defined as a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team, specialising in the treatment of patients with first-episode psychosis. Such a team would normally provide comprehensive psychiatric care to its patients and is an alternative, rather than an addition, to standard psychiatric care. In the context of a trial, it is likely that any specialised team would also offer phase-specific interventions.</P>

<P>In the context of improving outcome in first episode, the common control conditions are standard care, or care from a specialised team (which does not offer the phase-specific treatment being provided in the treatment arm of the trial). Standard care would be the normal service for people with severe psychiatric illness in the region where the trial took place, and would normally consist of out-patient follow up, medication, and support form a community mental health team, but would not involve any phase-specific treatment or specialised team.</P>

However, simple comparisons of atypical neuroleptic medication versus standard neuroleptics in first-episode patients were beyond the scope of this review.</P>

<P>We (MM and AL) searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register. Working independently we examined the papers identified from the search strategy. We discarded obviously irrelevant publications and retained only those in which some form of early intervention had been compared against a control treatment, and obtained copies of papers relating to relevant trials. Once we had obtained these papers, we decided whether the trials were eligible. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. For the 2006 update we (MM and JR) independently inspected citations. Where disagreement occurred, we sought to resolve this by discussion, or where doubt remained, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once we had obtained the full articles, we independently decided whether they met the review criteria. We resolved any disagreements that occurred by discussion, and when this was not possible we added trials to the list of those awaiting assessment until we acquired further information. For the 2009 update we (MM and JR) inspected all study citations identified by the searches, and obtained full reports of the studies of agreed relevance.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING>
<P>We (MM, AL) independently extracted and entered trial data into Review Manager (RevMan) twice, cross-checking for consistency (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). An initial analysis included all trials meeting inclusion criteria, whilst a second sensitivity analysis excluded all but the highest quality trials (Category A and B). For the 2006 and 2010 update, we (MM and JR) independently extracted and entered data into RevMan, cross-checking again for consistency. Where disputes arose, we attempted to resolve these by discussion.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicates a 'favourable' outcome for early intervention. Where this was not possible, (for example, scales that calculate higher scores=improvement) we inserted a minus sign into the data tables to reverse the graphical display in RevMan analyses so that the direction of effect was clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore we only included continuous data from rating scales were if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); in cases with data that are greater than the mean we entered them into the 'Other data' table as skewed data. Where the skewed data are derived from a trial with &#8807; 200 participants, the skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
<P>If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we entered change data in RevMan analyses and reported the finding in the text to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Final endpoint value versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, only final endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Where studies reported only change data we contacted authors for endpoint figures.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (for example, mean days per month).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-02-28 20:42:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Again working independently, we assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated an estimate of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% (fixed-effect) confidence intervals (CI). RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) using <A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">Visual Rx</A>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, had scales of very considerable similarity been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients (ICCs) of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (M) and the ICC (Design effect=1+ (M -1)*ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over design</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (for example, pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we will only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>We first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error and confidence interval were available for group means, and either P value or T value were available for differences in mean, we noted these, and in future versions will calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>): When only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) can be calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formula do not apply, we, in the future will calculate SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Some of these imputation strategies can introduce error. The alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We will examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Amminger_x002d_Austria" TYPE="STUDY">Amminger-Austria</LINK> compared omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) with placebo over three months in adolescents at risk of first-episode psychosis according to the criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Yung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-EIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">EIPS-Germany</LINK> employed a complex intervention consisting of 12 months of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered in group and individual therapy sessions, supplemented by cognitive remediation therapy. The participants were at risk of developing first episode of psychosis and met the early initial prodromal state criteria. The control group were given supportive therapy sessions which only provided minimal support involving psychoeducation and counselling.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-LIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">LIPS-Germany</LINK> employed a needs focused intervention combined with amisulpride (mean dose 118 mg/day) in participants judged at risk of psychosis because of the presence of prodromal symptoms. The control group also received the needs focused intervention but without amisulpride. The needs focused intervention included psychoeducation, crisis intervention, family counselling and assistance with education or work related difficulties according to the patient's need.</P>
<P>The Early Detection and Intervention Evaluation trial (<LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>) used cognitive therapy, limited to a maximum of 26 sessions over six months, following the principles developed by <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1976</LINK>. The therapy was problem-orientated and time limited and was carried out by experienced cognitive therapists. Both control and treatment group received regular monitoring. Whilst participants (treatment and control) were not given medication, both treatment and control received elements of case management in order to resolve crises regarding social issues and mental health risk.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK> the intervention involved prescription of low dose risperidone (1-2 mg/day) combined with modified CBT, which aimed to enhance understanding and control of symptoms. Both the intervention and control groups also received case management from a PACE therapist. This involved supportive psychotherapy, assistance with accommodation and education/employment, and family support. Participants in the control and intervention groups received standard treatment if they developed psychosis, but control patients were not otherwise prescribed neuroleptics. Both groups could be prescribed antidepressants and benzodiazepines.</P>
<P>The Prevention through Risk Identification Management and Education study (<LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK>) randomised participants to olanzapine 5-15 mg/day (mean 8 mg/day) or placebo for one year, and then followed up for a further year without medication. Individual and family psychosocial interventions with supportive and psychoeducational components were available to all patients during the first year. The nature of the psychoeducational components varied across sites despite efforts to apply them in a uniform way.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Spain" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Spain</LINK>, drug naive first-episode participants were randomised to three different antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol) and then randomised to either Early Behavoural Intervention or the control group (routine clinical care).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Berger_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Berger-Australia</LINK>, the first-episode psychosis participants were given ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid oil (E-EPA) at a dose of 500 mg twice daily, with a flexible dose of atypical antipsychotics. The control group received placebo capsules with a flexible dose of atypical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Edwards_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards-Australia</LINK>, the intervention group received a behavioural modification intervention, Cannabis and Psychosis Therapy (CAP). This consisted of weekly sessions of CBT provided by trained clinicians over three months. The aim of the CAP intervention was to reduce cannabis intake and to improve clinical and psychosocial functioning. CAP involved an assessment of engagement, followed by education about cannabis and psychosis and developing motivation to change. The focus of therapy was determined by the phase of commitment to change and could include further educational sessions, motivational interviewing, goal setting, and discussion about relapse prevention. An active control group was used which consisted of psychoeducation, which explained psychosis, medication and other treatments, and relapse prevention, but did not discuss cannabis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Jackson_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson-Australia</LINK>, the intervention group received CBT with 20 sessions provided for 45 minutes, plus antipsychotics. The control group were given a befriending service in addition to antipsychotics.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Killackey_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Killackey-Australia</LINK>, the intervention group received individual placement and support, which is an intervention designed to help people with mental illness to find and keep competitive employment. The support provided in the programme continued after employment was obtained, and was adapted to the needs of the individual. The control group received treatment as usual.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Leavey_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">Leavey-UK</LINK>, the intervention group received a brief intervention and treatment as usual. The brief intervention was provided over seven sessions, lasting about one hour, and included: information gathering from the relative, plus sessions on: psychotic illness, symptoms and early warning signs, treatment, help seeking; coping strategies, problem solving and communication with the patient. The control group were given treatment as usual.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-LEO_x002d_CAT_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">LEO-CAT-UK</LINK> was a cluster-randomised trial in which primary care (GP) practices were randomly allocated to receive training in early detection of psychosis and direct access to LEO-CAT (a specialised treatment team for first-episode psychosis). The control group of General Practice clinics did not receive training in early detection and continued to refer new cases of psychosis to local mental health services who could then refer on to the LEO-CAT programme.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-LifeSPAN_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">LifeSPAN-Australia</LINK>, the intervention group received standard clinical care plus LifeSPAN therapy which draws on the experience at EPPIC with Cognitive Orientated Therapy for Early Psychosis (COPE) and suicide manuals such as Choosing to Live and Cognitive Therapy of Suicide Behaviour. Four phases are used for the intervention: (a) initial engagement, (b) suicide risk assessment/formulation, (c) cognitive modules and (d) final closure/handover.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK> the intervention was behavioural family therapy for one year. Eighteen family therapy sessions were held over a 12-month period. Each family was treated by two co-therapists, from a team of two psychologists and one social worker, all of whom had at least one year of experience in providing family interventions for schizophrenia. The intervention was based on the behavioural family management approach of <LINK REF="REF-Falloon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falloon 1984</LINK> and involved psychoeducation, communication training and development of problem solving skills. Both intervention and control groups also received care from a specialised first-episode team involving individual-oriented therapy consisting of maintenance medication and disease and stress management.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK>, participants received integrated treatment or standard care. Integrated treatment consisted of high fidelity assertive community treatment supplemented by behavioral family therapy and social skills training. Standard care consisted of care at a community mental health centre. All participants were offered antipsychotic drugs according to guidelines from the Danish Psychiatric Society, which recommends a low-dose atypical antipsychotic strategy for first episodes of psychotic illness. Each participant was usually in contact with a physician, community mental health nurse and in some cases a social worker. In a small proportion of cases, standard care also included psychosocial interventions such as training in social skills or daily living activities, or supportive contacts with the family. Antipsychotics were given to both groups based on the psychiatrists' clinical assessment.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff-USA</LINK> study provided participants with Adherence Coping Education (ACE) which consists of 14 sessions lasting between 30 and 45 minutes over six months. It is a manual-based psychotherapy grouped into four phases: (1) establishing therapeutic alliance; (2) promoting treatment adherence; (3) developing a plan for maintenance treatment and (4) rehabilitation. The control group received supportive therapy which involved (1) establishing the therapeutic relationship, and (2) providing emotional support plus discussion of non-illness issues or topics.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zhang_x002d_China" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang-China</LINK> also used family therapy, but in the form of group and individual family sessions which were delivered on an outpatient basis over the 18-month follow-up period. Both intervention and control groups also received care from the outpatients department, (consisting of medication and review) but no regular appointments or community follow-ups were provided.</P>

<P>a. Brief Psychopathological Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from 0-126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. Data from this scale were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Edwards_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards-Australia</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK> the scale was used primarily to report severity of psychotic symptoms.</P>
<P>b. Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>)<BR/>The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale was developed from the BPRS and the Psychopathology Rating Scale. It is used as a method for evaluating positive, negative and other symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. The scale has 30 items, and each item can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from one (absent) to seven (extreme). This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates low levels of symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK> used this scale to determine transition to psychosis. <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">LIPS-Germany</LINK> reported data from the PANSS.</P>
<P>c. Scale of Psychotic Symptoms - SOPS (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>)<BR/>The SOPS scale was modelled on the PANSS scale and is designed to measure the presence/absence of prodromal states. It consists of five positive symptom items, six negative symptom items, four disorganisation symptoms items, and four general symptom items. Each has a severity rating from 0 (never, absent) to six (severe/extreme - and psychotic for the positive items). The severity of the prodromal state is based on the sum of the rating from the SOPS items and ranges between 0 and 114. <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>d. Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety - HRSA (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>)<BR/>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptoms, often used in psychotropic drug evaluation. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). The 14 items consist of: anxious mood; tension; fears; insomnia; intellectual; depressed mood; somatic complaints (muscular); somatic complaints (sensory); cardiovascular symptoms; respiratory symptoms; gastrointestinal symptoms; genitourinary symptoms; autonomic symptoms and behaviour at Interview. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>e. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HRSD (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>)<BR/>This is an interviewer rated scale for measuring depression. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview and depends on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. It contains 17 variables measured on either a five point or a three-point rating scale. The variables include: depressed mood; suicide; employment and loss of interest; retardation; agitation; gastro-intestinal symptoms; general somatic symptoms; hypochondriasis; loss of insight and loss of weight. Higher scores indicate more severe depression. <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>f. Calgary Depression Rating Scale - CDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1990</LINK>)<BR/>The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia is a nine-item scale ( 0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe.) that was specifically developed for assessment of depression in patients with schizophrenia. It has been evaluated in both relapsed and remitted patients, and is provided as a semi-structured interview. High scores indicated worse outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff-USA</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>g. Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale - MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>) <BR/>This is a 65-item comprehensive psychopathology scale used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness. Ratings are based on 10 items, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. This scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-LIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">LIPS-Germany</LINK>.<BR/>
<BR/>h. Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-SF (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>)<BR/>This is a 21-item self-rating scale for depression. Each item comprises four statements (rated 0-4) describing increasing severity of the abnormality concerned. The person completing the scale is required to read each group of statements and identify the one that best describes the way they have felt over the preceding week. A total of 12/13 is an indicative score for presence of significant depression. The short form of this scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Edwards_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards-Australia</LINK>.</P>
<P>i. Presence of Psychosis Scale - POPS (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2006</LINK>)<BR/>The Presence of Psychosis Scale (POPS), is part of the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes scale (SIPS).

Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>The SAS is a 10-item scale used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptoms. The 10 items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. The scale comprises a 10-item rating scale, each item rated on a five-point scale with zero meaning the complete absence of condition and four meaning the presence of condition in extreme. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> reported data from this scale,</P>
<P>b. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale - BAS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is a four-item scale to assess the presence and severity of drug-induced movement disorder akathisia. It is a widely used comprehensive rating scale for akathisia. Items include restless movements that characterise akathisia, the subjective awareness of restlessness and any distress associated with the condition. These items are rated from zero (normal) to three (severe). In addition, there is an item for rating the global severity that starts from zero (absent) to five (severe). A low score indicates low levels of akathisia. <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>c. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale has been used to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dyskinesia and chronic akathisia, as well as 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term, drug-induced movement disorder. However, using this scale in short-term trials may also be helpful to assess some rapidly occurring abnormal movement disorders such as tremor. Scoring consists of rating movement severity in the anatomical areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk) on a five-point scale (0-4). A low score indicates low levels of dyskinetic movements. <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>

<P>The CSQ-8 is an eight-item self-report of global measure of patient satisfaction with services. The CSQ is substantially correlated with treatment dropout, number of therapy sessions attended, and with change in client-reported symptoms. The CSQ-8 consists of eight items rated on a four-point Likert scale. The items are concerned with quality of services received, how well services met the client's needs and general satisfaction. The total score ranges from eight to 32.

<P>Studies were undertaken in the UK, Australia, Holland, Austria, Germany, Scandinavia, the USA and China. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Amminger_x002d_Austria" TYPE="STUDY">Amminger-Austria</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">EIPS-Germany</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">LIPS-Germany</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK>) were concerned with preventing the development of psychosis in prodromal patients; 11 evaluated interventions for improving outcome in first-episode psychosis (<LINK REF="STD-Berger_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Berger-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killackey_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Killackey-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LEO_x002d_CAT_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">LEO-CAT-UK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leavey_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">Leavey-UK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LifeSPAN_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">LifeSPAN-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff-USA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang_x002d_China" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang-China</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Trials to prevent the development of psychosis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 COMPARISION 1. Phase specific intervention (olanzapine) + non-specific supportive therapy versus placebo + non-specific supportive therapy - PRIME-USA</HEADING>
<P>This study randomised a total of 60 people; we think this number is probably too small to detect a treatment affect. Attrition rates were not significantly different, although slightly more people did leave the olanzapine group by 12 months (65% by 12 months).</P>
<P>Olanzapine did not alter the numbers of people converting to psychosis over 12 months when compared with placebo. Also the Clinical Global Impression 'severity of illness' and the Global Assessment of Functioning 'current' change scores were both non-significant. Data were limited by study size, and larger groups may well have produced a different outcome. We did not find any significant outcome data from the SOPS scale during 12 months of evaluation. The PANSS, YMRS and MADRS scores were also equivocal, indicating that no real change in mental state occurred over a 12-month period for the olanzapine and placebo group.</P>
<P>For adverse effects, extrapyramidal symptoms were not more frequent in the olanzapine group compared with the placebo group (SAS, BAS and AIMS), even though olanzapine dosage levels were within the lower end of the normal dose range. Olanzapine did produce a statistically significant increase in weight compared with the placebo group. This limited data supports other recent reports of olanzapine's association with weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 2005</LINK>). CoStart terms were also recorded and all were equivocal except for weight gain, with significantly more people gaining weight in the olanzapine group. Cardiovascular measures were taken on blood pressure and pulse whilst sitting and standing over eight weeks with all data being equivocal. Twelve-month data (sitting) pulse rates were significantly lower in the placebo group, but this may have been a chance finding since all other data were non-significant. Fatigue was higher in the olanzapine group with a NNH of four.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 COMPARISON 2. Phase specific intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy) + non-specific supportive therapy versus non-specific supportive therapy- EDIE-UK, EIPS-Germany)</HEADING>
<P>Again there were few data to find (total n=188). We found no differences for numbers of participants leaving the study early by 12 months (n=60, RR 0.98 CI 0.4 to 2.2), and again at two years (n=60, RR 0.96 CI 0.6 to 1.5) and as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability, CBT did not enhance or worsen compliance in the (<LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>) study.</P>
<P>The numbers of participants becoming psychotic over 12 months of observation were low and no significant differences between CBT (4/37) and the monitoring group (5/23) were found for this primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>).</P>
<P>Social functioning data were also non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-EIPS_x002d_Germany" TYPE="STUDY">EIPS-Germany</LINK>).</P>
<P>This approach, as with many others in this review, should be considered experimental.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 COMPARISON 3. Phase-specific treatment (risperidone + cognitive behavioural therapy) + specialised team versus specialised team (PACE-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>All participants (n=59) remained in the study for one year, which is unusual for randomised trials of this length (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The adherence to the study may have been due to participants being relatively well (i.e. prodromal) and also being cared for by a specialist team. This greatly limits applicability.</P>
<P>Initial findings from this comparison suggest that a phase-specific treatment combining risperidone and CBT can delay, but not prevent the onset of psychosis (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Whilst these findings are of interest, they are not definitive, as the single included trial (<LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK>) is substantially under-powered at the 12-month end-point. Moreover the use of a combination of phase-specific treatments makes it unclear how far each contributes to the outcome, though a sub-analysis by the trialists suggests that risperidone makes the primary contribution.</P>
<P>Global function (GAF) did not appear to have any effect on outcome in terms of global state, and again with such a small number of participants doubts will remain regarding efficacy. Delaying the onset of psychosis does not appear to have a substantial effect on medium-term outcome, in terms of mental state. This could be because the trial is under powered, or it may be that the benefits of delaying onset of psychosis are less than anticipated. It is also difficult to evaluate the benefits of delaying psychosis without more information on the impact of treatment from the perspective of service users and carers.</P>
<P>No improvements in quality of life occurred in the early intervention group, even though they were given CBT. However, they also received risperidone, which may have negated any gains in quality of life, due to its adverse effects profile.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 COMPARISON 4. Phase specific intervention (amisulpride + needs focused interventions versus needs focused interventions (LIPS-Germany)</HEADING>
<P>Participants (total n=124) given both needs focused therapy and also amisulpride remained in the study more than the group given only needs focused intervention. This is not necessarily a beneficial outcome given the adverse effects of the amisulpride in a group of participants that are at risk of developing psychosis.</P>
<P>Global Assessment of Functioning scores favoured amisulpride plus NFI. Although the study reports data on global state of the prodromal participants, information on transition to psychosis would have been more useful in interpreting the value of such treatment combinations. Mental state measures in terms of PANSS global scores and PANSS-positive scores did favour amisulpride plus NFI. However, no significant differences were found for PANSS negative symptoms, or depression scores. Again, transition to psychosis data would have been more useful and are notable by their absence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.5 COMPARISON 5. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) versus placebo (Amminger-Austria)</HEADING>
<P>This study aimed to assess the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing psychosis. The treatment group were significantly less likely to develop psychosis compared with the placebo group at 12 weeks. A NNT of 6 in a sample of 76 is an important result. This study should be replicated with a larger sample and participants followed for at least six months to determine whether a sustained treatment effect is present.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Trials to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 COMPARISON 6. Phase-specific treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy for suicidality) + specialised team versus specialised team (LifeSPAN-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>The LifeSPAN study involved only 56 participants. Therapy did not affect the numbers of people leaving the study early over six months; larger sample sizes and perhaps longer study time may have produced less equivocal data. Two people committed suicide, one in each group. The study size is too small to determine whether LifeSPAN therapy can reduce suicide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 COMPARISON 7. Phase-specific treatment (family therapy) + specialised team versus specialised team (Linszen-Amsterdam)</HEADING>
<P>This was another important but small (n=76) study. Adding family therapy to care from a specialised team did not affect relapse rates, but <LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK> was substantially under powered, so that no definitive conclusions can be drawn. An unusual characteristic of the trial was that all participants had to consent to a three-month inpatient admission before randomisation. This may have limited the ability of the intervention to show an effect by excluding any differences in relapse rates occurring in the first three months after onset. It also limits applicability of findings to other early intervention services, which tend to be oriented towards reducing or avoiding admissions, rather than extending them (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 COMPARISON 8. Phase-specific treatment (family therapy) + standard care versus standard care (Zhang-China)</HEADING>
<P>Retention of the 83 study participants over 18 months of care was good, with only 6% being lost to follow-up; the phase-specific intervention with family therapy did not prove either a benefit or hindrance to study attrition.</P>
<P>Family therapy in addition to standard care did reduce readmission rates and possibly helped compliance. Unfortunately other outcome data were not presented on an intention-to-treat basis and are impossible to use. The main limitation of this trial was the particular nature of the standard care given, which appeared to be a low-key form of outpatient treatment, with little continuity and no community follow-up. This makes it difficult to be certain how far the reduced admission rate in the intervention group was a non-specific effect of substantially increased contact with patients and their families, rather than a particular effect of family therapy. No data were available on how far the finding of fewer admissions was accompanied by improvements in outcome, or service user and carer satisfaction.</P>
<P>Family therapy did not appear, from limited participant numbers, to improve treatment compliance and larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 COMPARISON 9. Specialised team versus standard care (OPUS-Scandinavia)</HEADING>
<P>This is the only large study in the review (n=547, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Integrated treatment significantly reduced the numbers of people leaving the study early by 12 months (NNT 9) and as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability was found to be more acceptable than placebo. By two years, attrition rates were still significantly favouring integrated treatment (NNT 7). It appears participants were prepared to remain in treatment longer when care was given from a specialist team, which for people with psychosis is an important outcome.</P>
<P>Global Assessment of Functioning 'symptom' scores significantly favoured integrated treatment by 12 months, but this was not sustained and two-year data were equivocal; GAF 'function' scores were equivocal at 12 months, but by two years did significantly favour integrated treatment. These outcomes seem to confound each other and more research is needed to adequately determine if this form of care can indeed improve global state.</P>
<P>Participants were significantly more satisfied with services in the integrated treatment group by 12 months, and this was sustained over two years. This result does fit with the positive findings for retention rates in the integrated treatment group. Overall, participants in the integrated care group were more compliant with treatment and outpatient visits than the standard care group. This effect was seen over one- and two-year time points, suggesting integrated treatment is more acceptable to people with first-episode psychosis than the standard care available to the control group. Again this result is consistent with attrition and user satisfaction outcomes.</P>
<P>Two people died from suicide, one person from each group.</P>
<P>We did not find any significant differences in the mean number of days per month participants spent in hospital and integrated treatment offered no advantages compared with the control group in terms of reducing the need for hospital care. Unfortunately, no data were reported on relapse. Relapse is a primary outcome for this review and an important measure of treatment efficacy for people with first-episode psychosis, clinicians and health care managers.</P>
<P>We did not find integrated treatment to have any significant effect on participants' ability to live independently over one- and two-year assessments. Integrated treatment did significantly improve participants' employment and educational circumstances with 'not employed or in education' being lower by two years (NNT 11). However one-year data were non-significant, suggesting that two years of care are needed before benefits are obtained, although more data are needed to show this effect, especially as most outcome data were not significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK> is an important study. It is a large study - but even it should be replicated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.5 COMPARISON 10. Phase-specific treatment cognitive behavioural treatment + antipsychotics versus befriending + antipsychotics (Jackson-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>Neither CBT or the befriending intervention managed to retain significantly more of the 62 participants over the 12 months of the study.</P>
<P>Although two deaths from suicide occurred, this did not suggest a significant difference between the two study groups.</P>
<P>We did not find advantage for CBT participants in their social functioning compared with the control befriending group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.6 COMPARISON 11. Specific intervention E-EPA oils + atypicals versus placebo + atypical (Berger-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>Neither intervention proved to be more advantageous in retaining the 80 participants within the study.</P>
<P>The number of people showing no response to treatment did not reveal any significant difference, in this short-term trial of 12 weeks' duration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.7 COMPARISON 12. Phase-specific treatment brief intervention + antipsychotics versus treatment as usual (Leavey-UK)</HEADING>
<P>At the end of the nine-month intervention, both treatments were similarly acceptable to the 106 participants, with no differences emerging in study attrition.</P>
<P>Over the course of nine months hospital admissions were not significantly lower in either intervention group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.8 COMPARISON 13. Phase-specific treatment (ACE) + antipsychotics versus treatment as usual (Uzenoff-USA)</HEADING>
<P>This was a study involving 24 participants. During the six months of the study, the interventions' study attrition was not significantly different.</P>
<P>We were able to report several mental state outcomes (PANSS positive, negative, general or total scores, depression rating scale scores), and all were non-significant. However, with only 24 participants it is unlikely that any treatment effect would reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Quality of life as measured using the Heinrichs-Carpenter Scale was equivocal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.9 COMPARISON 14. Phase-specific treatment vocational intervention + TAU versus treatment as usual (Killackey-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>The emphasis of this study of 41 people was the use of vocational-based interventions. Data revealed that the vocational training group was employed significantly more than the control group during the six months of evaluation.</P>
<P>No advantage emerged for either group in retaining participants within the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.10 COMPARISON 15. Phase-specific treatment (cap) +antipsychotics versus psychoeducation (Edwards-Australia)</HEADING>
<P>The study (total n=47) aimed to minimise cannabis usage in people with first-episode psychosis. We found no significant difference between groups. The small sample size may have contributed to the lack of any treatment effect.</P>
<P>The participants understanding of psychosis, measured with the KAPQ questionnaire, did not reveal any differences at three and nine months' assessment. The use of an active control may have contributed to the non-significant finding. The BPRS-derived data on the positive symptoms of psychosis failed to reveal any significant benefits for CAP therapy compared with psychoeducation.</P>
<P>We found that neither CAP or psychoeducation improved social functioning over nine months in this small study; a larger scale trial would have increased the likelihood of finding statistically significant data.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.11 COMPARISON 16. Crisis assessment versus standard care (LEO-CAT UK)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison involved 113 participants. From limited data, we found that hospital admissions were not increased or decreased for participants given crisis assessment. Similarly, participants given crisis assessment were no more likely to be referred to mental health services than the control group. Again, from such a small study it is possible that real effects of interventions are not being highlighted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.12 COMPARISON 17. Early behavioural intervention versus routine care interval (all data from Alverez-Spain)</HEADING>
<P>As with most of the other trials, <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Spain" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Spain</LINK> was too small to really produce results with confidence. We are not sure if early behavioral intervention helps people whose weight is a problem (n=61).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.13 COMPARISON 18. Phase-specific intervention versus control (Exploratory meta-analysis)</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analyses proved problematic because of the heterogeneity in the intervention and outcomes. No two studies were sufficiently alike to perform meta-analyses without reservations of their clinical meaningfulness. Only leaving the study early and hospitalisation data were pooled and in both cases no significant differences were found. An agreed set of core outcome measures in trials assessing early intervention for psychosis would increase the estimate of any treatment effects (<A HREF="http://www.liv.ac.uk/nwhtmr/comet/comet.htm">COMET</A>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-03-02 18:20:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the comprehensive search, we included 18 studies, most of which have small sample sizes. <LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK> is the exception with over 500 people randomised. Additionally, only two studies were similar to be grouped together under the same comparison; the rest used different interventions or controls. These limitations are a source of uncertainty in our results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>We had hoped to gather information from trials on a whole series of outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, employment status, quality of life and costs. We have identified a series of pioneering studies, none of which provide data on all outcomes, most of which are inappropriate to synthesise together and therefore data are incomplete for every outcome for every one of the many comparisons in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Six of the 18 studies were undertaken at the <A HREF="http://www.eppic.org.au/">EPPIC</A> Centre in Melbourne, Australia and work embedded in this region&#8217;s excellent, pioneering and world-class services may not be widely applicable. However, and understandably, many of the other trials were undertaken by leading figures in the world of early intervention. Again, services within these studies may be better than is standard. This would serve to narrow any differences between intervention and control group.</P>
<P>Often in meta-analyses we have data from trials undertaken all around the world, in different cultures of care, synthesised. In these cases basically homogeneous findings would point to wide applicability of findings. In this review, however, meta-analyses have been very limited and, therefore, we have to remain very cautious regarding applicability.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-03-02 18:24:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies were randomised, although in terms of allocation concealment, the quality of included studies was acceptable but not good, since precise details of the method of randomisation were lacking for most studies. One study (<LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>) attempted to blind raters, but this proved difficult and was not adequately maintained as participants 'divulged' sufficient information to inform the rater which treatment participants were receiving. <LINK REF="STD-Edwards_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards-Australia</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang_x002d_China" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang-China</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LifeSPAN_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">LifeSPAN-Australia</LINK> also used raters who were blind to group allocation, but they did not report whether allocation concealment was maintained. One study (<LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK>) did use double-blind methodology, made possible by both groups receiving the same psychosocial intervention with the variable being medication (olanzapine or placebo), which was easier to blind for than non-pharmaceutical interventions. <LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK> used independent raters not blinded to treatment. The nature of these therapies is not suited to the raters being blind to treatment allocation and where this was attempted (as with <LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK>) it proved difficult to maintain throughout the study.</P>
<P>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang_x002d_China" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang-China</LINK>) key data were presented in a way that did not permit an intention-to-treat analysis on most outcomes. Rates of follow-up were particularly good in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-PACE_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">PACE-Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang_x002d_China" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang-China</LINK>) and unclear (but probably acceptable) in one (<LINK REF="STD-Linszen_x002d_Amsterdam" TYPE="STUDY">Linszen-Amsterdam</LINK>). Numbers of people lost to follow-up was not excessive in the other trials, but not good - <LINK REF="STD-EDIE_x002d_UK" TYPE="STUDY">EDIE-UK</LINK> 70%, <LINK REF="STD-PRIME_x002d_USA" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME-USA</LINK> 65%, <LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK> 77% and <LINK REF="STD-LifeSPAN_x002d_Australia" TYPE="STUDY">LifeSPAN-Australia</LINK> 75%. One study did find significant differences in follow-up rates between treatment and controls (<LINK REF="STD-OPUS_x002d_Scandinavia" TYPE="STUDY">OPUS-Scandinavia</LINK>); the effects of this are unclear but may have had an impact on the findings of this review. A substantial omission from most trials was an attempt to capture the perspective of service users and their carers, by, for example, using satisfaction scales.</P>

<P>The current update now includes 18 studies; however, due to the variety of interventions used we have added only two studies under the same comparison category, but because they did not measure the same outcomes we have not synthesised the data. We are, therefore, unable to make any firm recommendations for practice.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people presenting with prodromal symptoms of psychosis</HEADING>
<P>At the moment it is not clear whether treating people presenting with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia provides benefits. There is inconclusive evidence on the personal and social consequences of providing treatment to people who will not necessarily become unwell. Further evidence is needed before recommendations can be given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For people in their first episode of psychosis</HEADING>
<P>There is some support for specialised early intervention services but again further evidence is needed. However, since such people do require treatment in some form, the ethical issues are less intense than for people presenting with prodromal symptoms. Moreover, there is also little evidence to support the 'standard care', which is the alternative to the employment of specialised first-episode teams (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). The use of first-episode teams is therefore ethical even though there is not, as yet, strong evidence to support it.</P>
<P>Phase-specific treatments for people in their first episode of psychosis may help with employment and family therapy. Whilst this evidence is limited, it should be viewed in the broader context that family therapy is known to be effective for people with schizophrenia as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Pharoah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pharoah 2006</LINK>). On this basis, it would seem reasonable to recommend family therapy to people experiencing their first episode of psychosis, but there is insufficient data to suggest that they should be given this intervention as a priority over people with established illness.</P>
<P>There is no evidence from clinical trials to support the benefits of early detection of patients in their first episode of psychosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Family intervention may be of value for people in their first episode of psychosis, as it may for people with longer established illnesses. It is important for clinicians to continue to keep up to date with this fast-expanding field.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. For policy makers</HEADING>
<P>It is premature to implement wide-spread treatment programmes for people with prodromal symptoms. Such treatment programmes should only be implemented within the context of a well-designed randomised study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>If <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been followed by authors of the included studies and the editors of the journals in which those reports were published, the effects of early intervention for psychoses would be more evident.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>This review has identified a discrepancy between the global rate of growth of early intervention services and the paucity of underpinning evidence. Whilst there is a compelling theoretical case for early intervention, much of the supporting evidence is circumstantial (based on the correlation between duration of untreated psychosis and outcome) rather than definitive (based on improved outcome in clinical trials). If this discrepancy persists, the obvious risk is that, eventually, early intervention will become routine practice, without its efficacy ever being definitively established.</P>
<P>Whilst this review has found some evidence of a growing body of research in the field, there is no room for complacency over the amount of work that needs to be done. Possible combinations of early detection, type of participant (prodromal or first episode), type of control, and type of intervention (phase-specific or specialised team) generate at least 17 possible types of trial. However, the review has identified 18 included trials, most of which are clearly under-powered. The current substantial international interest in early intervention offers an opportunity to make major positive changes in psychiatric practice, but this opportunity may be missed without a concerted international programme of research to address key unanswered questions.</P>
<P>These key questions are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Can phase-specific treatments prevent people with prodromal symptoms from developing psychosis and, if so, do they or their carers benefit as a result?</LI>
<LI>Can early detection reduce the duration of untreated psychosis, and if so, does this lead to improvements in outcome for service users and carers?</LI>
<LI>Are there phase-specific treatments that improve outcome for people with first-episode psychosis, or for their carers?</LI>
<LI>Do specialised early intervention teams offer improvements in outcome over and above those provided by phase-specific treatments alone?</LI>
</UL>
<P>These questions give rise to two important points, which if borne in mind at the design stage, might increase the value of future trials in the field. Firstly, a phase-specific treatment should not be a priority for investigation unless it is known to be substantially different from existing interventions that are already known to be helpful to people at all stages of schizophrenia. For example, there is little point in investigating the effects of behavioural family therapy with minor modifications for first-episode patients, when this intervention is known to be generally effective in schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Pharoah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pharoah 2006</LINK>). Phase-specific treatments ought to be given priority for evaluation only when they are substantial departures from what would be considered standard care, or where there is evidence that they are likely to be more effective when offered in the early stages of the illness.</P>
<P>Secondly, great care must be taken in defining the characteristics and activities of specialised early intervention teams. The complexity of 'early intervention' makes it likely that no two specialised teams will be identical. Unless the essence of an early intervention team can be adequately characterised, it is inevitable that disappointing findings will lead to arguments over whether a particular specialised team was really practising early intervention. Years of research effort can be wasted in this way. Lessons should be learned from research which has already been undertaken with other specialised psychiatric teams (such as assertive outreach teams) and fidelity scales developed as an early priority.</P>

<P>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). We allocated non-randomised studies (of early detection only, see above) to Category C. We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding trials in randomisation Category C, and trials with a follow up rate of less than 80%. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, we excluded trials if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.</P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However we did not use the Jadad Scale was to exclude trials.</P>
