<P>Topical medications are often applied to the inside of a patient's nose prior to examining the nose, sinuses and throat with a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The aim of this is to reduce any discomfort the patient may feel and also to improve the adequacy of the examination.</P>
<P>Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine and they are usually administered as a spray, although they may also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity, or as gels, pastes or creams.</P>
<P>We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing any of these topical treatments with placebo, no treatment or another topical treatment in adult patients undergoing nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL). We included eight studies in the review (with a total of 746 patients). It was not possible to combine data from any of the studies, therefore we assessed the individual study results. Five of the studies did not demonstrate any advantage, in terms of reducing pain or discomfort, of using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One of these suggested that a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of "general unpleasantness". Two studies did not compare the treatment against placebo or no treatment. A final study actually suggested an increase in pain with the use of topical agents. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste.</P>
<P>Further standardised research is required.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-16 09:00:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One study suggested that a vasoconstrictor alone should be used to reduce the general level of unpleasantness. Two studies did not compare treatment against placebo or no treatment, so it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from them. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste.</P>
<P>There was variation in the format of the outcome data and a lack of complete data; none of the included studies reported their results in a way that would allow pooling and we could not therefore perform meta-analysis.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 09:13:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies do not demonstrate any evidence to support the use of topical treatments prior to the use of a fibre-optic nasal endoscope. Some go as far as to suggest that these agents should not be used due to cost and unpleasant side effects. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of reducing pain or discomfort when using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. The absence of demonstrable effect may be due to relatively small patient groups. It is therefore possible that there is a small effect of using these sprays. Further research using standardised reporting methods is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-16 09:06:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-15 09:13:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is performed in order to examine the anatomy of the nasal cavity, the postnasal space, the pharynx and the larynx, when diagnosing benign and malignant disease, or looking for foreign bodies.</P>
<P>The procedure dates back to the early 20th century, when Hirschman performed the first successful endoscopy of the nose (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschmann-1903" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschmann 1903</LINK>). A rod-lens optical system (rigid) was invented by Harold Hopkins in 1959, and Karl Storz further developed fibre-optic (flexible) endoscopy in 1960 after its initial patenting by John Logie Baird. Both methods are now an integral part of the diagnosis of sinonasal, pharyngeal and laryngeal pathology. The increased brightness, magnification and the ability to take still and video images is a particular advantage (<LINK REF="REF-Jaumann-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaumann 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>NPL is a very common procedure in both outpatient and ward settings. The number of procedures can vary from a handful in an otology clinic to several dozen per day in a head and neck cancer clinic. It may also be performed in patients admitted as emergencies, for example, with stridor or foreign bodies.</P>
<P>NPL has been recommended in situations where a diagnosis cannot be made from patient history and anterior rhinoscopy, and also in patients with anatomic obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Benninger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benninger 1997</LINK>). Levine stressed the importance of nasal endoscopy by showing that, in a series of 150 patients, the procedure revealed pathology not seen on anterior rhinoscopy in 38.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1990</LINK>). Hughes found that diagnostic accuracy was higher with endoscopic examination (85%) than anterior rhinoscopy (74%) (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1998</LINK>). Fibre-optic pharyngolaryngoscopy can also be used to visualise dynamic anatomy, such as when assessing velopharyngeal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Muntz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muntz 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is a procedure that is at best uncomfortable and at worst intolerable for the patient, sometimes making accurate assessment difficult. There are many different topical preparations for the relief of the perceived pain and discomfort of NPL, some of which are controlled drugs. Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine. Some of these will be found to provide better comfort than others, some will have more side effects and others will prove to be more costly.</P>
<P>Any method which reduces discomfort will help in the examination, diagnosis and treatment of patients' disorders. The local preparation used within a department is likely to be chosen on the basis of cost, availability, or for 'historical' reasons (i.e. has always been used); often with little evidence to support the choice. Other reasons for choosing a particular agent may be the onset of action and duration of effect, and studies should ensure that these agents have been used appropriately with regard to this.</P>
<P>The agent is usually administered by a spray (<LINK REF="STD-Cain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cain 2002</LINK>). It can also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Walshe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 2002</LINK>), and also as gels, pastes or creams. Studies have compared different preparations to placebo and to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walshe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 2002</LINK>), but it remains unclear which is the best preparation to use, if any. Results vary: some studies report improvement in outcome measures such as pain, discomfort or ease of the procedure; others conclude that the use of topical preparations is unnecessary and may even be disadvantageous. There can also be a trade-off between using agents that may be beneficial to the patient in terms of reducing pain and discomfort but, for example gels and pastes, may obscure the image for the endoscopist.</P>
<P>This review aims to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of topical agents for improving the patient and clinician experience of nasal endoscopy. It will also look at the cost and side-effect profile of each preparation. This review will be restricted to flexible endoscopy, in order to include studies that have used endoscopes to examine the pharynx as well as the nasal cavity and sinuses.</P>

One of the studies had a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>). Numbers of participants in the studies ranged from 60 to 152 patients (total 746). Seven of the studies were carried out in the UK and one in the US. All were carried out in adult patients (age range 17 to 91 years) undergoing endoscopy for diagnostic purposes in an otolaryngology clinic. The interventions used were all nasal sprays administered at varying lengths of time prior to endoscopy. The sprays used were cocaine, lidocaine, co-phenylcaine, tetracaine, ephedrine, xylometazoline and saline. In some studies there was an arm where no treatment was given. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>) lubrication was used in all arms of the study, and in others it was not clearly stated. In all studies visual analogue scores were used to record outcome measures. All studies recorded pain or discomfort. Other outcome measures used varied from study to study but included unpleasantness of taste, burning, choking, numbness, difficulty of swallowing and gagging.</P>

<P>Eight studies, with a total of 746 participants are included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Cain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cain 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frosh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frosh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We sought information that was missing or requiring clarification by contacting the study authors, but only a few responded. Ultimately, the data were insufficient and incomparable preventing combination in meta-analysis. We have outlined the reasons for this below on a study-by-study basis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cain 2002</LINK> included 90 patients in total. The study had three treatment arms: co-phenylcaine, saline and no spray. However, they did not specify the number in each group. Furthermore, more than one endoscopist performed the procedures leading to potential confounding. No significant difference was found in participants' pain or discomfort during the procedure as a result of the interventions. This was also true for the ease of examination and quality of view as reported by the operator. However, no specific statistical figures were given in the paper. The numbers of participants would suggest that a significant difference should be detected if one existed, but without the statistical details, it is difficult to know for sure.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frosh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frosh 1998</LINK> had 82 patients in total, but again did not specify the number in each of the three treatment arms: lidocaine, saline and no treatment. Furthermore, ratios of antilogged means were reported with no reference to the non-transformed data. The mean pain score for lignocaine was significantly higher than that for the no spray group (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 4.67; P = 0.048), but not the saline group (95% CI 0.51 to 2.19; P = 0.878). Comparisons for unpleasantness of spray application (95% CI 4.29 to 14.7; P &lt; 0.001) and unpleasantness of spray taste (95% CI 4.99 to 14.74; P &lt; 0.001) were reported for lignocaine versus saline only. Both comparisons showed lignocaine to fare poorly. Again, there are a reasonable number of participants in the study, suggesting that the statistical findings are likely to be close to that which would be found in the general population.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK> compared the effect of co-phenylcaine and saline. There were 51 patients in the co-phenylcaine group and 47 in the saline group. Their outcome measures were pain and taste, as expressed on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The authors found that co-phenylcaine had no effect on pain, but patients found taste significantly worse with co-phenylcaine. Data were reported after logarithmic transformation. However, we contacted the author who provided the original non-transformed data (this allows the calculation of standardised mean differences (SMDs) which are required in order to make comparisons between different studies). There was also an overall discomfort outcome measure, but this was deemed to be a reflection of the overall experience of the procedure rather than due directly to the passage of the endoscope, and was therefore not considered to be part of the defined outcome measures of this review. No significant difference was found between the two groups as far as the primary outcome (pain) was concerned (95% CI -0.49 to 0.39; P &lt; 0.001) but a VAS for bad taste scored significantly worse (95% CI -1.19 to -0.39; P &lt; 0.001) in the co-phenylcaine group.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leder 1997</LINK> carried out two separate experiments within their paper, of which only the first fulfilled the review criteria. One hundred and fifty-two patients were included. There were three interventions: tetracaine (n = 54), ephedrine (n = 50) and saline (n = 48). The authors used a comfort-discomfort score based on an ordinal scale of 1 to 5. They found no difference in the outcome measure between the three sprays. During endoscopy, they used a sheath which increased the diameter of the device to 4.1 mm, whilst most of the other studies had used endoscopes with a 3.7 mm diameter, making a valid comparison not possible. Whereas the majority of studies all had a 10-minute interval between application of spray and start of procedure, this study used only a one-minute interval. Furthermore, although sufficient information was available to calculate SMDs, a valid combination of data was not possible due to the difference in the type of VAS between this and the <LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK> study. No significant differences in outcomes of comfort-discomfort between the treatment groups was identified. Standard deviations were reported rather than 95% CIs; tetracaine (mean 1.96, SD 0.93), ephedrine (mean 2.30, SD 0.93) and placebo (mean 2.40, SD 1.11).</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>The study <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1996</LINK> involved 80 patients and compared co-phenylcaine and cocaine, however the numbers in each group were not specified. The size of the scope and the time interval from application of spray to start of procedure was not stated. The method of randomisation and blinding was not described. Furthermore, the spray was also applied to the oropharynx which may have been a confounding variable. No significant difference was found in pain scores between the two treatment groups. Mean scores and ranges were reported (co-phenylcaine: 1.28, 0 to 6; cocaine 0.95, 0 to 4; P = 0.36).</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: LOW</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK> involved 100 patients who were evenly distributed (n = 25) within four treatment arms: lignocaine/phenylephrine, xylometazoline, lignocaine and no intervention. Unfortunately, as lubrication was also used in this setting, we were unable to use the study to combine data due to this confounding variable. This study did not find any significant effect on pain but concluded that the administration of a vasoconstrictor reduced the level of "general unpleasantness". Results of statistical analysis for unpleasantness scores were reported by comparing the presence or absence of vasoconstrictor, rather than for all four groups individually. Means were 21.54 (no vasoconstrictor) and 12.30 (vasoconstrictor), with 95% CI 1.4 to 17.1 and P = 0.022. Similarly, for unpleasant taste, results were reported comparing the presence/absence of local anaesthetic. Mean levels were 1.48 (no local anaesthetic) and 5.06 (local anaesthetic), with 95% CI 0.5 to 6.61 and P = 0.022.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK> included 60 patients in a study comparing cocaine and saline using a cross-over design. Outcomes (pain, ease of procedure) were reported as a VAS (0 to 5), but the analysis was made by grouping the VAS into two groups: VAS 0 to 2, and VAS 3 to 5, rather than using means. With cocaine, 51 (85%) patients reported a VAS between 0 to 2 and nine (15%) between 3 to 5. With saline, 50 (83.3%) reported a VAS between 0 to 2, and 10 (16.7%) between 3 to 5. No significant difference was found in pain scores between sides treated with cocaine or saline (P = 0.26). Due to the nature of the study, a correlation analysis for septal deviation was performed, and again no significant difference was found (P = 0.41). Regarding ease of procedure, for the cocaine side, 53 (88.3%) patients were found to have a VAS between 0 to 2, and seven (11.7%) a VAS between 3 to 5. For saline, this was 41 (68.3%) VAS 0 to 2, and 19 (31.7%) VAS 3 to 5.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: MODERATE</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> conducted two experiments in their study. Only the second was suitable to be considered, in which cocaine and co-phenylcaine were compared in 84 patients. However, they did not give sufficient information to allow standardised mean differences to be calculated and therefore inclusion in meta-analysis was not possible. No significant difference was found in pain scores between the two groups (P = 0.2). A description of taste was sought rather than any form of grading for its unpleasantness.</P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY: HIGH</P>
<P>There was insufficient information from the studies about the costs of the various agents. This, combined with the fact that we were unable to perform adequate combination of differences, made a cost-effectiveness analysis impossible. For similar reasons, comparisons of content of preparation, method of administration and dosage were not possible.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-16 09:06:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight randomised controlled trials (746 participants) in this review. All studies were carried out in adult patients undergoing endoscopy for diagnostic purposes in an otolaryngology clinic and all interventions used were nasal sprays (cocaine, lidocaine, co-phenylcaine, tetracaine, ephedrine, xylometazoline and saline) administered varying lengths of time prior to endoscopy. Some studies included a no treatment arm, in some lubrication was used and in others this was not clearly stated. Visual analogue scores were used to record outcome measures in all studies and all measured pain or discomfort. Other outcome measures used varied from study to study but included unpleasantness of taste, burning, choking, numbness, difficulty of swallowing and gagging.</P>
<P>Of the included studies, five did not demonstrate any advantage in using topical treatments prior to endoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Cain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cain 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>). Of these, one study suggested that the use of a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of "general unpleasantness" of the procedure, but that use of a local anaesthetic increased scores for unpleasant taste (<LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>). Two studies did not make a comparison against placebo or no treatment, and therefore a conclusion on the benefit of topical agents cannot be drawn (<LINK REF="STD-Lennox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>). An eighth study reported an increase in pain scores with the topical agent (<LINK REF="STD-Frosh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frosh 1998</LINK>). However, the numbers of patients (from the studies which reported their figures) within the groups are moderate (between 25 and 54), which makes it difficult to determine whether the lack of effect demonstrated is due to inadequate numbers of patients or a real lack of effect. It is a great shame that meta-analysis of these results has not been possible as it may have helped to answer this question.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 09:51:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified several studies that looked into the question posed by this review. Although the general impression from the studies that fulfilled initial criteria for inclusion was that there was no difference between any of the topical agents and placebo/no spray, insufficient data within each study prevented combination of any of their results. As such, their applicability to clinical practice may be regarded as limited. Nonetheless, the general sentiment within this group of studies is that topical agents at best confer no added benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Cain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cain 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>) and at worst cause unpleasant effects (<LINK REF="STD-Frosh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Frosh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Georgalas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Georgalas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of other topical agents available (e.g. adrenaline, benzocaine) which could be used for future studies and may demonstrate more favourable outcomes.</P>
<P>From the authors' experience, current practice in terms of application of topical agents to the nasal cavity prior to nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy is variable. However, those clinicians who routinely do so may consider omitting this step in the procedure.</P>

<P>The randomised controlled trials included in this review were well conducted, but due to methodological differences a meta-analysis was not possible. Reasons for this inability to combine data included inconsistent/inappropriate methodology, incomplete reporting of methods and results and differences in statistical analysis.

<P>Although there were several randomised controlled trials identified, all either had methodological problems or reported insufficient information to allow satisfactory combination of results, making it difficult to draw specific conclusions. However, we can say that there does not appear to be any good evidence for the application of topical spray before nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy. It is possible that the failure of individual studies to detect a significant effect is a type 2 error. Had larger studies been undertaken, or a meta-analysis of smaller studies been possible, it may have been possible to be reach more certain conclusions. Although we are unable to show this using meta-analysis, the majority of the studies we found did not show an advantage and, furthermore, they report unwanted effects such as foul taste, numbness and overall unpleasantness.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-15 09:54:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future randomised controlled trials in this area should follow and report appropriate methodology. Trial authors should follow the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>) in order to ensure that reporting is clear, that the method can be properly assessed and that the data are in a form that can be used in meta-analysis. It would be helpful if authors use similar scoring systems to one another so that comparison can be made between them. We would suggest visual analogue scores using a scale of 0 to 100 mm. Future studies should consider investigating the effects of other agents, such as adrenaline and benzocaine.</P>
