<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-02 13:49:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures, and is not always well controlled. This review assessed data from fifty-one studies and found that paracetamol provided effective pain relief for about half of participants experiencing moderate to severe pain after an operation, including dental surgery for a period of about four hours. There were no clear differences between doses of paracetamol typically used. These single dose studies did not associate paracetamol with any serious side effects.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2004 - this original review had been split from a previous title on 'Single dose paracetamol (acetaminophen) with and without codeine for postoperative pain'. The last version of this review concluded that paracetamol is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain, but additional trials have since been published. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paracetamol using current data, and to compare the findings with other analgesics evaluated in the same way.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 17:42:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Area under the &#8220;pain relief versus time&#8221; curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with paracetamol or placebo experiencing at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, using validated equations. Number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) was calculated, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use, were sought as measures of duration of analgesia. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was also collected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-31 12:06:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Fifty-one studies, with 5762 participants, were included: 3277 participants were treated with a single oral dose of paracetamol and 2425 with placebo. About half of participants treated with paracetamol at standard doses achieved at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, compared with about 20% treated with placebo. NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours following a single dose of paracetamol were as follows: 500 mg NNT 3.5 (2.7 to 4.8); 600 to 650 mg NNT 4.6 (3.9 to 5.5); 975 to 1000 mg NNT 3.6 (3.4 to 4.0). There was no dose response. Sensitivity analysis showed no significant effect of trial size or quality on this outcome.</P>
<P>About half of participants needed additional analgesia over four to six hours, compared with about 70% with placebo. Five people would need to be treated with 1000 mg paracetamol, the most commonly used dose, to prevent one needing rescue medication over four to six hours, who would have needed it with placebo. Adverse event reporting was inconsistent and often incomplete. Reported adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and occurred at similar rates with 1000 mg paracetamol and placebo. No serious adverse events were reported. Withdrawals due to adverse events were uncommon and occurred in both paracetamol and placebo treatment arms.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-11 17:48:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-11 17:44:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>This is an update of a review published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>in Issue 1, 2004 on 'Single dose oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for postoperative pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004a</LINK>). The title now states that the review is limited to adults.</P>
<P>In the clinical development of analgesics, the first step is to demonstrate that they alleviate pain. This can only be done by testing them in people with established pain, and experience has shown that this must be clinical, rather than experimentally-induced, pain. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, also called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is appropriate, because not all participants given analgesic will have significant pain relief, and about 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The demonstration that a drug is an analgesic in an acute pain situation is important. In itself, such demonstration does not determine the utility of the tested drug in any particular situation. However, because drugs that work well in one pain condition generally work well in others, with a similar relative efficacy, acute pain trials provide useful information relevant to many other pain conditions. Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful. An example is the relative efficacy in the third molar extraction pain model (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity or pain relief scales immediately before the intervention, over the following four to six hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. Patients with inadequate pain relief after 60 to 120 minutes are given rescue medication. For these patients it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was first identified as the active metabolite of two older antipyretic drugs, acetanilide and phenacetin in the late nineteenth century. It became available in the UK on prescription in 1956, and over-the-counter in 1963 (<LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>). Since then it has become one of the most popular antipyretic and analgesic drugs worldwide, and is often also used in combination with other drugs.</P>
<P>The lack of significant anti-inflammatory activity of paracetamol implies a mode of action distinct from that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) yet, despite years of use and research, the mechanisms of action of paracetamol are not fully understood. NSAIDs act by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX), now recognised to consist of two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, which catalyses the production of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. Paracetamol has previously been shown to have no significant effects on COX-1 or COX-2 (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 2003</LINK>), but is now being considered as a selective COX-2 inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Hinz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinz 2008</LINK>). Significant paracetamol-induced inhibition of prostaglandin production has been demonstrated in tissues in the brain, spleen, and lung (<LINK REF="REF-Botting-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botting 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flower-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flower 1972</LINK>). A 'COX-3 hypothesis' wherein the efficacy of paracetamol is attributed to its specific inhibition of a third cyclooxygenase isoform enzyme, COX-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Botting-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botting 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chandrasekharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandrasekharan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>) now has little credibility, and a central mode action of paracetamol is thought to be likely (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite a low incidence of adverse effects, paracetamol has a recognised potential for hepatotoxicity and is thought to be responsible for approximately half of all cases of liver failure in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2001</LINK>), and about 40% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2008</LINK>). Acute paracetamol hepatotoxicity at therapeutic doses is extremely unlikely despite reports of so-called therapeutic misadventure (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2000</LINK>). In recent years legislative changes restricting pack sizes and the maximum number of tablets permitted in over-the-counter sales were introduced in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1997</LINK>) on the basis of evidence that poisoning is lower in countries that restrict availability (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2001</LINK>). The contribution of these changes, which are inconvenient and more costly (particularly to chronic pain sufferers), to any observed reductions in incidence of liver failure or death, remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2007</LINK>). There have been concerns over the safety of paracetamol in patients with compromised hepatic function (those with severe alcoholism, cirrhosis or hepatitis) but these have not been substantiated (<LINK REF="REF-Dart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dart 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PIC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIC 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Low technology interventions such as oral paracetamol administration, used appropriately, have the potential to reduce unnecessary pain. Paracetamol is the analgesic of choice for adult patients in whom salicylates or other NSAIDs are contraindicated. Such patients include asthmatics, those with salicylate allergies, and those with a history of peptic ulcer. Paracetamol is useful for children with febrile viral illnesses, in whom aspirin is contraindicated due to the risk of Reye's syndrome (swelling of the brain that may lead to coma and death).</P>
<P>The previous version of this Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004a</LINK>) concluded that paracetamol is effective for postoperative pain, but additional trials have since been published. This review aims to provide robust estimates of both efficacy and harm, in a format facilitating direct comparison with other analgesics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>QUOROM guidelines were followed (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one valid post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. Analyses were planned for different doses (where there were at least 200 participants). Sensitivity analyses were planned for pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain), trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm), and quality score (two versus three or more).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief</HEADING>
<P>For each study, mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) for active and placebo groups were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active treatment and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT).<BR/>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>Visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, the number of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global evaluation scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" would be used for the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Numbers of participants requiring rescue medication were used to calculate numbers needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) use of rescue medication for treatment and placebo groups.

<P>For 975 to 1000 mg paracetamol, 18 studies reported data on use of rescue medication. The weighted mean proportion for paracetamol was 53% and for placebo 72%, giving an NNTp of 5.2 (4.3 to 6.7) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no clear dose response for this outcome, with 95% CIs for NNTp overlapping. Five people would need to be treated with 1000 mg paracetamol, the most commonly used dose, to prevent one needing rescue medication over 4 to 6 hours, who would have needed it with placebo.</P>

<P>Data for the time to use of rescue medication was not available for all studies that reported the number of participants using it. A total of 17 studies reported the median, five studies the mean, and three studies both median and mean time to use of rescue medication. Median time to rescue medication varied between 2.1 and more than six hours for active treatment and 1.0 to 3.0 hours for placebo.The weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication was 3.8 hours for paracetamol (all doses) versus 1.6 hours for placebo. Mean time to rescue medication varied between 2.8 and 4.7 hours for active treatment and 2.5 and 3.5 hours for placebo. The weighted mean of the mean times to use of rescue medication was 3.8 hours for paracetamol (all doses) versus 2.9 hours for placebo. There were insufficient data to analyse use of rescue medication by dose of paracetamol.</P>
<P>Half of the participants required rescue medication by 3.8 hours if treated with paracetamol, compared to 1.6 hours if treated with placebo.</P>

<P>The time over which adverse event data were collected varied from four hours to seven days.

Few studies reported whether adverse event data continued to be collected after rescue medication had been taken. Reported adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and occurred at similar rates of around 16% in both paracetamol and placebo groups. There was no dose response.</P>
<P>One study reported a serious adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2005</LINK>). However, this was in a patient in a treatment arm not relevant to the review (intravenous propacetamol).</P>

<P>Patients who took rescue medication were classified as withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and are reported under 'use of rescue medication' above.</P>
<P>Data on other withdrawals were generally poorly reported, probably because these were single dose studies where withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy are uncommon. Some studies reported participants who had invalid data due to inadequate baseline pain, who violated a protocol, or took rescue medication within the first hour, as withdrawals or exclusions. Whether these should be included in the intention-to-treat population is arguable. Attrition due to invalid data is unlikely to affect results.</P>
<P>A total of six patients were reported as withdrawing due to adverse events: one each with nausea and vomiting after paracetamol 500 mg and one with fever, nausea and diarrhoea after placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Dolci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dolci 1994</LINK>), two with vomiting after paracetamol 1000 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Kiersch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kiersch 1994</LINK>), and one for an unspecified reason after paracetamol 650 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Efficacy of pain relief in dental versus other surgical pain models was analysed as part of the main efficacy analysis.There were sufficient data to perform this analysis for each dose. The results are shown with the summary of results A table in the text.</P>
<P>Three studies with 305 participants used 500 mg in dental pain. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 3.8 (2.7 to 6.4). Three studies with 256 participants used 500 mg paracetamol in other surgical pain, with an NNT of 3.2 (2.3 to 5.1).</P>
<P>Ten studies with 1276 participants used 600 to 650 mg in dental pain. The NNT was 4.2 (3.6 to 5.2). Nine studies with 610 participants used 600 to 650 mg paracetamol in other surgical pain, with an NNT of 5.6 (4.0 to 9.5).</P>
<P>Nineteen studies with 2157 participants used 975 to 1000 mg in dental pain. The NNT was 3.2 (2.9 to 3.6). Ten studies with 1075 participants used 975 to 1000 mg paracetamol in other surgical pain, with an NNT of 3.7 (3.1 to 4.7).</P>
<P>There were differences between pain models in RR, but not in NNT. Response rates for active treatment were similar in both models, but placebo response rates were lower in dental than other surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study quality</HEADING>
<P>A quality score of three out of five was considered adequate, given that for inclusion in the review each study had to score at least one point for being randomised and one for being blinded. There were insufficient numbers of participants in studies scoring less than three points to permit analysis by dose within each quality group.</P>
<P>Three studies with 214 participants had a quality score of less than three. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 2.8 (2.1 to 4.4). Fourty-eight studies with 5332 participants had quality scores of three or more, giving an NNT of 3.7 (3.4 to 4.1). Trials with lower quality scores, which are more likely to be subject to bias, produced a slightly greater, but not significantly different, treatment effect, though based on relatively small numbers (Summary of results E).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study size</HEADING>
<P>A threshold of 40 or more participants in both the treatment and placebo arms was used to assess the effect of study size on the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. Twenty-one studies had fewer than 40 participants in both treatment arms giving an NNT of 4.3 (3.5 to 5.5), whilst 30 studies (32 comparisons) had 40 or more participants in each treatment arm giving an NNT of 3.7 (3.4 to 4.2). Restricting the analysis to studies using 1000 mg paracetamol gave an NNT of 3.3 (2.5 to 5.1) for studies with fewer than 40 participants per treatment arm, and 3.6 (3.2 to 4.1) for studies with 40 or more participants per treatment arm (Summary of results E).</P>
<P>No significant effect of size on the primary outcome was demonstrated using 40 participants per treatment arm as the threshold.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 17:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>Since the previous review a number of new larger studies of good methodological quality have been published, all using 1000 mg of paracetamol, which is generally regarded as the most useful dose clinically. This updated review included 561 participants treated with a single dose of paracetamol 500 mg and 1886 participants treated with 600 to 650 mg, both unchanged form the previous review. For the 975 to 1000 mg dose, 3252 participants were treated, 495 more than the earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004a</LINK>) giving a more robust (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998a</LINK>), but almost identical result.</P>
<P>The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. This is now generally regarded as a useful level of pain relief in acute pain, and also in chronic pain conditions such as arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008a</LINK>) and neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>). It has the advantage that it also highlights that not all of those given an analgesic have useful pain relief, and that interventions do not work in everyone. Participants not having a useful level of pain relief are important because therapeutic failure is to be avoided. Figures and tables therefore provide percentages of patients with outcomes, as well as statistical comparisons.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the relative benefit or NNT for at least 50% pain relief by dose. Values for NNT were 3.5 (2.7 to 4.8) for 500 mg, 4.6 (3.9 to 5.5) for 600 to 650 mg , and 3.6 (3.2 to 4.1) for 975 to 1000 mg. About half of participants treated with paracetamol at standard doses achieved at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, compared with about 20% treated with placebo. The differences between dental and other postsurgical pain have been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004c</LINK>). Consistently lower placebo responses in the dental pain model do not effect the NNT as a measurement of efficacy. Dose response may be more sensitively determined using trials that directly compare two doses, as has been done for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with 500 mg (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because the same methods of analyses have been used, it is possible to compare the NNT for a single dose of oral paracetamol with that of a single dose of other NSAIDs (<LINK REF="REF-Bandolier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandolier 2008</LINK>).</P>
<UL>

<P>We have effective analgesics, but clinical practice finds it difficult to use effective analgesics effectively. More immediately relevant outcomes are needed than relative benefit and even numbers needed to treat. One is the time before participants with adequate pain relief require additional analgesic because the pain has returned. This can be measured in terms of the mean or median time to remedication, or the percentage of participants needing more analgesic over a particular time. This update includes both these outcomes. Previous versions of this review have not reported data on participants using rescue medication, and not all studies (32/51) provided this information.</P>
<P>The median time to use of rescue medication varied greatly between trials, particularly for the active treatment arms, but was generally longer for paracetamol than placebo. The weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication (all doses of paracetamol) at 3.8 hours is equal to or shorter than most non-selective NSAIDs (diclofenac 50 mg 3.8 hours, ibuprofen 400 mg 5.3 hours, naproxen 9.8 hours) and much shorter than etoricoxib 120 mg and rofecoxib 50 mg (20 hours or more). There was insufficient data to analyse this by separate paracetamol dose, as not all studies reporting number of patients remedicating also reported this outcome. However, the short time to remedication is unlikely to be a result of the over-representation of low dose studies providing median time to use of rescue medication data (those using 500 mg paracetamol, which is not commonly used), as only 3 of the 17 studies in this analysis used 500 mg paracetamol, and almost 90% of the data was from studies of 600 mg or more.</P>
<P>About half of participants needed additional analgesia over four to six hours, compared with about 70% with placebo. Significantly fewer participants required rescue medication with paracetamol than with placebo across all doses. There was no dose response. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one patient needing rescue medication within 4 to 6 hours were: 3.6 (3.0 to 6.0) for paracetamol 500 mg, 7.8 (5.2 to 15) for 600 to 650 mg, and 5.2 (4.3 to 6.7) for 975 to 1000 mg .</P>
<P>Longer duration of action is desirable in an analgesic, particularly in a postoperative setting where the patient may experience postoperative nausea, or be dependent on a third party to respond to a request for rescue medication. Duration of pain relief and requirement of rescue medication information have only recently been recognised as important outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), and a fuller evaluation of the importance of these outcomes will depend on more data being collected from other, ongoing, systematic reviews.</P>
<P>Assessment of adverse events is limited in single dose studies as the size and duration of the trials permits only the simplest analysis, as has been emphasised previously (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). Combining results was potentially hampered by the different periods over which the data was collected. There was also and uncertainty about whether adverse event data continued to be collected after rescue medication had been taken. This could disproportionately inflate adverse events in the placebo groups, which tended to use more rescue medication. Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity, and were most likely to be related to the anaesthetic or surgical procedure (e.g. nausea, vomiting and somnolence). Although the original review compares individual adverse events, we deemed there to be insufficient data in for this analysis to be valid.</P>
<P>We did calculate the NNH for any adverse event, and found no significant difference between paracetamol and placebo for numbers of participants experiencing any adverse event in the hours immediately following a single dose of the study medication. No serious adverse events were reported. Withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in both paracetamol and placebo treatment arms, but were uncommon, and too few for any statistical analysis. It is important to recognise that adverse event analysis after single dose oral administration will not reflect possible adverse events occurring with use of drugs for longer periods of time. In addition, the relatively small numbers of participants, even when all the trials were combined, and short duration of studies is insufficient to detect rare but serious adverse events, which typically occur with longer use, and at rates of much less than 1 in 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis did not demonstrate an effect of trial size or quality on relative benefit or NNT. It is noteworthy that there were only three trials (214 participants) of low quality so this analysis lacked sensitivity. The evidence base is overwhelmingly of good quality, and efficacy results are unlikely to be affected by these characteristics.</P>
<P>The main limitation is that these were single-dose studies, and they could be criticised because pain relief, even in the acute setting, usually requires multiple dosing. That is true, but, in very general terms, pain is pain, and these single diose studies have been used for over 60 years to establish that a drug is actually an analgesic. The relative effectiveness of drugs and other interventions in this setting translates well to other settings like migraine, or musculoskeletal pain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-31 12:09:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>We now have a considerable body of evidence for the efficacy of paracetamol at doses between 600 and 1000 mg. It is unlikely that further studies will alter the estimates for the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. More recent trials were generally of good quality, and efficacy data, where collected, was well reported. More consistent data on use of rescue medication, would provide better estimates of duration of analgesia, which in turn may help to decide which analgesics are most effective in the clinical setting. The quality of adverse event reporting remains problematical.</P>

<P>This update includes outcomes that were not considered for the protocol in the original review. This reflects increased understanding of the clinical trial data over the past 10 years or more, in part because of the results of systematic reviews.

<P>This review was first published as a Cochrane systematic review by Moore et al entitled: 'Single dose paracetamol (acetaminophen) with and without codeine for postoperative pain' , published in 1998. The original review has been split into two reviews: paracetamol alone, and paracetamol plus codeine. Paracetamol alone was updated and published as a Cochrane review by Barden et al in 2004. This review is an update of the 2004 review on 'Single dose oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for postoperative pain in adults'.</P>

<P>A restricted search in September 2017 did not identify any potentially relevant studies. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. If appropriate, we will update the review if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.</P>

<B>Categorical rating scale:</B> The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none=0, mild=1, moderate=2 and severe=3, and for relief none=0, slight=1, moderate=2, good or lots=3 and complete=4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS:</B> Visual analogue scale: For pain intensity, lines with left end labelled "no pain" and right end labelled "worst pain imaginable", and for pain relief lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome the limitation of forcing patient descriptors into particular categories. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain or pain relief. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimeters. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
<P>
<B>TOTPAR:</B> Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>
<B>SPID:</B> Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS TOTPAR</B> and <B>VAS SPID</B> are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
