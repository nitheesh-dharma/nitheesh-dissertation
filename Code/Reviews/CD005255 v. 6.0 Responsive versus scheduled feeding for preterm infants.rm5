<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Does a policy of feeding preterm infants on a responsive basis compared to feeding prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals improve growth, length of hospital stay and parent satisfaction?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Feeding preterm infants in response to their hunger and satiation cues (responsive, cue-based, or infant-led feeding) rather than at scheduled intervals might enhance infants' and parents' experience and satisfaction, help in the establishment of independent oral feeding, increase nutrient intake and growth rates, and allow earlier hospital discharge.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We searched for all available evidence up to January 2016. We found nine eligible randomised controlled trials (including a total of 593 infants) that examined whether feeding preterm infants in response to their own feeding and satiation cues (sometimes called 'demand' feeding) is better than feeding set volumes of milk at predefined intervals. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Results: </B>Although the trials were generally small and most had some methodological weaknesses, analysis suggests that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain and reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding. The quality of this evidence is low, and the importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the length of hospitalisation. None of the included trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions: </B>This Cochrane review does not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding improves outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Responsive feeding might help infants transition more quickly to oral feeding, but more randomised controlled trials would be needed to confirm this finding.</P>

<P>We found nine eligible RCTs including 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD &#8722;1.36, 95% CI &#8722;2.44 to &#8722;0.29 g/kg/day), and provide some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding (MD &#8722;5.53, 95% CI &#8722;6.80 to &#8722;4.25 days). GRADE assessments indicated low quality of evidence. The importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation.

<P>Overall, the data do not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Some (low quality) evidence exists that preterm infants fed in response to feeding and satiation cues achieve full oral feeding earlier than infants fed prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals. This finding should be interpreted cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials. A large RCT would be needed to confirm this finding and to determine if responsive feeding of preterm infants affects other important outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-23 15:26:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The frequency of feeding and volume of milk intake of healthy term infants is generally dictated by the infant's appetite. Term infants exhibit feeding and satiation cues and adjust their volume of intake to compensate for differences in the nutrient density of various milks (<LINK REF="REF-Fomon-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fomon 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fomon-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fomon 1975</LINK>). In contrast, enteral feeds for preterm infants are usually given as prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Siddell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddell 1994</LINK>). Some evidence exists that preterm infants are also able to self-regulate their intake (<LINK REF="STD-Horton-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 1983</LINK>). Furthermore, while feeding cues may be more difficult to detect in preterm infants, they may be sufficiently evident for a parent or caregiver to recognise and respond to (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2002</LINK>). Caregivers and parents can use infants' physiological and behavioural channels of communication to inform their feeding decisions and actions. Although studies have shown that responsive (cue-based) feeding is feasible for preterm infants, the adoption of responsive feeding has however been constrained by the "schedule- and volume-driven culture" in many neonatal units (<LINK REF="REF-Shaker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaker 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-09 13:59:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alternatives to a strict scheduled interval feeding regimen for preterm infants have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Crosson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosson 2004</LINK>). These strategies aim to respond to infant feeding and satiation cues and are particularly relevant to infants who are in the transition phase from gastric tube feeding to oral feeding (either breast, bottle, or cup-feeding) (<LINK REF="REF-Davanzo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davanzo 2014</LINK>). At this stage (from about 32 to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age), preterm infants are usually developing sustained alert activity and a coordinated suck-swallow-breathe pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Bu_x0027_Lock-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bu'Lock 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holditch_x002d_Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holditch-Davis 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Responsive (cue-based or infant-led, and previously often referred to as 'demand') feeding is a co-regulated approach (<LINK REF="REF-Crosson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosson 2004</LINK>). The enteral feeding process starts when the caregiver recognises infant cues that indicate readiness to feed and ends when the infant demonstrates satiation. The infant, therefore, determines the timing, duration, and volume of intake. In modifications of responsive feeding, caregivers may preset a maximum permitted duration of inactivity or sleep (generally up to five or six hours) between feeds or a maximum (upper limit) volume of intake. This strategy is more suited to infants who are receiving gastric tube feeds or who are fed orally from a bottle or cup. It is much more difficult to determine when the target volume of intake has been reached in breast-fed infants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Infant cues</HEADING>
<P>An infant's ability to feed well is closely related to the caregiver's ability to understand and respond to the infant's behavioural communication. Common cues include quiet wakefulness, hand-to-mouth gestures, and finger or fist sucking. Crying is a late feeding cue; mouthing, tongue-poking, arm waving, kicking, stretching, bicycling legs, and grunting are often exhibited before crying. Waiting for an infant to cry before feeding may mean caregivers have already missed key initial feeding cues and can lead to poor latching (in breast-fed infants), and gulping and air-swallowing. For a preterm infant, crying for feeds wastes effort and energy as well as raising stress levels at such a vulnerable developmental stage. If the quality of a feed takes priority over the quantity ingested, feeding skills may develop pleasurably and at the infant's own pace, enhancing the parents' experience of nurturing their child and satisfaction of neonatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kirk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaker 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Briere-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briere 2014</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-09 14:12:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Responsive feeding may be considered a part of an integrated approach to providing 'developmental care' for preterm infants. Infants are seen as individuals in their own right and caregivers are guided by the needs of the infant. The Cochrane review of other components of developmental care found some evidence that interventions such as minimising unnecessary exposure to external stimuli and clustering of care activities increase nutrient intake and rates of growth, and decreases the length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Symington-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symington 2006</LINK>). Allowing preterm infants to dictate the timing and duration of enteral feeding may result in longer rest periods between some feeds, promote infant-determined sleep and wake patterns that reduce unnecessary energy expenditure, and increase growth rates (<LINK REF="REF-McCain-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCain 2003</LINK>). It is also possible that allowing the infant to determine the pattern of enteral feeding will help in the development of organised behaviour states and the earlier establishment of full oral feeding, a key criterion for hospital discharge for preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2008</LINK>). This may be particularly relevant for infants and their mothers transitioning to exclusive breastfeeding. Responsive feeding for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care is now recommended as a method to increase the duration of breastfeeding in the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative "Ten steps to successful breastfeeding" (<LINK REF="REF-Nyqvist-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyqvist 2013</LINK>). There may be other benefits for the family and caregivers, principally allowing parents to feel more directly involved with their infant's care and increasing their confidence and ability to recognise and respond to their infant's needs during their hospital stay and beyond. Enhanced parental satisfaction is a key quality indicator in measuring the effectiveness of family-centred care in neonatal services (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-24 09:01:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Responsive feeding might help in the establishment of independent oral feeding, allow earlier hospital discharge, and enhance parent experience. Reducing length of hospital stay has a direct effect on hospital costs and may also decrease cot occupancy in neonatal units, thus reducing the need for inter-hospital transfer of women and infants. Potential adverse effects of responsive feeding for preterm infants are also recognised. These mainly relate to whether such a regimen can guarantee metabolic stability, particularly normoglycaemia, in this vulnerable group. Even at the point of discharge from hospital, some preterm infants are known to be susceptible to hypoglycaemia if a scheduled enteral feed is omitted or delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Hume-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hume 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mola_x002d_Schenzle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mola-Schenzle 2015</LINK>). There is concern that repeated or prolonged episodes of hypoglycaemia may impair longer term growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Duvanel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duvanel 1999</LINK>). There may be more acute problems relating to gastro-intestinal immaturity, such as feeding intolerance and a higher risk of aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs, as well as concerns that allowing unrestrained volumes of enteral intake may increase the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux or feed intolerance.</P>

<LI>Responsive feeding: The enteral feed starts in response to the infant's feeding cues and ends when the infant exhibits satiation cues. We accepted trials that assessed modifications or variations of responsive feeding such as: (i) the feed starts in response to the infant's cues but ends when a prescribed volume of intake is reached; (ii) the infant may be fed if he or she remains asleep beyond a predefined interval for assessing cues.</LI>
<LI>Scheduled interval feeding: Feeds are given at scheduled intervals without regard to the infant's sleep or wake status. Orally fed infants who are asleep are awakened to feed or fed via an enteral feeding tube if unable to be awoken sufficiently.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The infants in the comparison groups in each trial must have received the same type(s) of milk. We excluded trials where the type of milk is a co-intervention (unless as part of a factorial design in the RCT).</P>
<P>Any feeding cues used in individual trials were acceptable provided these were defined a priori. Trials that used the response to non-nutritive sucking on a pacifier as a tool for assessing readiness to feed in the intervention group were eligible for inclusion. However, we planned to interpret the findings of these trials with caution since the Cochrane review of non-nutritive sucking found evidence that this intervention improves bottle-feeding performance and is associated with a statistically significant decrease in length of hospital stay for preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Pinelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinelli 2005</LINK>). We did not specify a minimum trial duration as a primary eligibility criterion. However, we planned only to include growth data in meta-analyses from trials that allocated the intervention for a sufficient period (at least one week) to allow measurable effects on growth.</P>

<P>In cases where we considered risk of bias arising from inadequate concealment of allocation, poorly randomised assignment, incomplete follow-up or inadequate blinding of outcome assessment reduced our confidence in the effect estimates, we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency on the basis of similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals, and statistical criteria, including measurement of heterogeneity (I²). We downgraded the quality of evidence when inconsistency across study results was large and unexplained (i.e. some studies suggested important benefit, and others no effect or harm with no explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). We assessed precision accordingly with the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the pooled estimation (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All of the included trials were undertaken since 1980 by investigators attached to neonatal units in North America. The trials were small: 582 infants in total participated. The participants in all of the trials were clinically stable preterm infants who were fully enterally fed and at transition from intragastric tube feeds to oral feeds (generally between 32 and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age). Most trials excluded infants who were small for gestational age at birth and infants with congenital anomalies or gastrointestinal or neurological problems. The balance of oral versus tube feeding at enrolment differed between trials. One trial enrolled infants at the start of transition to oral feeding when infants were mainly fed via an intragastric tube (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2001</LINK>). In the other trials, infants were enrolled later in the transition phase when they were receiving most of their feeds orally. In six trials, intragastric feeding tubes were removed when infants were allocated to the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Collinge-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Collinge 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waber-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Waber 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pridham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pridham 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pridham-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pridham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kansas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kansas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puckett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Puckett 2008</LINK>). The most recently reported trial recruited only preterm infants with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, defined as receipt of supplemental oxygen therapy at 28 days postnatally (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2012</LINK>). The mean gestational age of infants in this trial was 25 weeks, and infants were recruited at an average postmenstrual age of 35 to 36 weeks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most trials described responsive feeding as allowing the infant to feed orally in response to cues such as crying, sucking on fingers/pacifier, or rooting. Feeding was ceased only in response to satiation cues, such as sleep or failure to maintain sucking. In three trials, infants who did not demonstrate feeding cues within five hours were aroused to feed orally or given a prescribed volume of milk via an intragastric tube (<LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waber-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Waber 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puckett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Puckett 2008</LINK>). In two trials, the infant's readiness to feed was assessed every three hours by the response to non-nutritive sucking (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2012</LINK>). Oral feeds were stopped when the infant stopped sucking or fell asleep. If the minimum prescribed amount was not taken the infants received a prescribed volume via the intragastric tube.</P>
<P>Scheduled interval feeding was generally defined as regular feeding either orally or via an intragastric feeding tube at three- to four-hourly intervals to achieve a prescribed intake. The target volume of intake in the trials varied from 100 to 160 mL/kg/day. In all of the trials the infants in the intervention and control groups received the same type(s) of milk. Most trial protocols permitted infants to receive either breast milk or formula milk or a mixture of these. One trial recruited only formula milk-fed infants (<LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The trials assessed only short-term outcomes, principally volume and energy intake, and growth parameters (usually weight) during the study period. The duration of study period was less than a week in six of the trials. In the other three trials the intervention was continued until the infants were assessed as being ready for discharge home, typically 10 to 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Kansas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kansas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puckett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Puckett 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2012</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 15:09:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine small RCTs including a total of 593 infants met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. The data from these trials do not provide strong evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Meta-analyses suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly lower levels of milk intake and rates of weight gain, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials. Although the trials provide some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding &#8212; a key criterion for determining readiness for discharge from hospital &#8212; the importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 15:45:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All but one of the included trials assessed the rate of weight gain but none reported data on change in length or head circumference. The short duration of the intervention and follow-up (less than a week) of many of the trials is unlikely to have allowed detection of substantial effects on growth. Meta-analysis of data from four trials which assessed weight gain for longer than one week (up to between 10 and 14 days) indicated that infants fed responsively gained weight slightly more slowly, gaining about 1.4 g/kg/day fewer than scheduled interval-fed infants. This effect on the rate of weight gain is consistent with a meta-analysis of data from the four trials which showed that responsive feeding resulted in a borderline statistically significantly lower volume of milk intake of about 6 mL/kg/day.</P>
<P>Three included trials reported that responsive feeding shortened the duration of the transition phase from tube to full oral feeds. Meta-analysis of data from two trials that recruited infants at the start of the transition to the oral feeding phase indicated that responsive feeding allows infants to establish oral feeding about five days earlier. However, the findings from these trials should be interpreted cautiously because the trial authors used non-nutritive sucking on a pacifier to assess readiness to feed and some evidence exists that non-nutritive sucking itself shortens the transition from tube to oral feeds for preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Pinelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinelli 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported that infants fed in response to feeding cues were discharged home several days earlier than infants in the scheduled interval feeding group (<LINK REF="STD-Collinge-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Collinge 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puckett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Puckett 2008</LINK>). The other trials did not confirm this finding. Meta-analysis of the effect of the intervention on the duration of hospital stay was limited because the included trials reported this outcome in different ways (total duration of hospital stay from birth, duration of stay post-randomisation, postmenstrual age at hospital discharge), and because some trial reports did not provide sufficient data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acceptability and impact</HEADING>
<P>It is unclear whether any of these marginal effects have any longer-term impacts or are of substantial importance to infants and families. None of the trials assessed any measures of parental (or staff) satisfaction with the intervention package. It is perhaps surprising that investigators have not assessed systematically the views of parents and caregivers given that the intervention is part of an integrated approach to providing 'developmental care' for preterm infants, an ethos that is relationship-based rather than protocol-driven and task-orientated (<LINK REF="REF-Symington-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symington 2006</LINK>). Similarly, none of the trials reported any data on breastfeeding outcomes or on potential harms or adverse consequences of responsive feeding, including metabolic instability, milk aspiration, or feed intolerance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Most included trials recruited very stable preterm infants without ongoing respiratory problems or other concerns. One trial recruited extremely preterm infants with evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia but these infants were enrolled when in a stable phase, typically at around 35 weeks' postmenstrual age (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2012</LINK>). The data therefore are most applicable to preterm infants who are at the transition phase from enteral tube feeding to oral feeding and who are stable and well.</P>
<P>All included trials were undertaken in neonatal care centres in North America. Although the findings are likely to be applicable to care practices in countries with similar types of perinatal health care services, it is much less clear how applicable this evidence is to care practices in low- and middle-income countries. In resource-limited settings, lower levels of staff availability (lower nurse:infant ratios) reduces the time available for assessment of individual infants' feeding cues. Conversely, if mothers rather than staff are the primary caregivers in resource-limited healthcare settings then responsive feeding regimens may be more feasible and practical, provided mothers are able, or are trained and supported to be able, to recognise feeding cues in preterm infants.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-09 15:46:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The GRADE assessment of quality of evidence for key outcomes was low because of possible publication or reporting bias (trials that did not show evidence of effect did not report numerical data for inclusion in meta-analyses) as well as concerns about the methodological rigour of the included trials. Although most trials used randomisation and allocation methods to prevent selection bias, none concealed the method of feeding from parents, caregivers, assessors, or investigators (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). This may potentially have resulted in performance or detection bias and knowledge of the feeding method may have affected other parental or clinical decisions, including those related to the timing of hospital discharge. Attrition bias was likely to have affected outcome estimates in two trials where almost half of all enrolled infants were discharged home before completing the study. Outcome data for inclusion in intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were not reported or available for these infants (<LINK REF="STD-Pridham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pridham 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pridham-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pridham 2001</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-24 10:14:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main concern with the review process is the possibility that the findings are subject to publication and other reporting biases. We attempted to minimise this threat by screening the reference lists of included trials and related reviews and searching the proceedings of the major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that are not (or not yet) published in full form in academic journals. The meta-analyses that we performed did not contain a sufficient number of trials to explore symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or reporting bias.</P>

<P>The currently available data are not sufficient to determine whether responsive feeding versus feeding prescribed enteral volumes at scheduled intervals improves important outcomes for preterm infants. Although some limited evidence exists that responsive feeding allows earlier attainment of full oral feeding, these findings should be interpreted and applied cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-24 10:15:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for a large pragmatic RCT to assess whether responsive feeding (versus scheduled interval feeding) improves important clinical outcomes for preterm infants and their families. Such a trial should probably focus first on those infants at the transition from enteral tube to oral feeding. The involvement of parent and infant support and advocacy groups in the trial design would inform the selection of the most relevant outcomes, including those related to parental satisfaction. Trials could also assess resource issues, such as the use of staff time to undertake assessments and feeding, as these may have implications for an economic analysis if responsive feeding is to have clinical benefits.</P>

If the infant continued to sleep at that stage, (s)he was given a gavage feed of the full prescribed volume. Feeds were stopped when the infant stopped sucking or fell asleep or demonstrated clinical instability. If the minimum prescribed amount was not taken the infants were supplemented by gavage.<BR/>Control infants (N = 41) received prescribed volumes of milk either orally or via a feeding-tube at 3-hourly intervals.
