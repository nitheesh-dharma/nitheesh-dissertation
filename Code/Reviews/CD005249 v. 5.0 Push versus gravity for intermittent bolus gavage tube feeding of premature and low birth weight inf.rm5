<P>We assessed the methodology of trials regarding blinding of randomisation and outcome measurement. We evaluated treatment effect with a fixed-effect model using risk ratio (RR), relative risk reduction, risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) for categorical data; and using mean, standard deviation and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data. We analysed outcomes measured as count data, for example frequency of apnoea, bradycardia and episodes of pulse oximeter oxygen (SpO<SUB>2</SUB>) desaturation, by comparing rates of events and the rate ratio. We evaluated heterogeneity to help determine the suitability of pooling results.</P>

<P>Only one small cross-over trial met the criteria for inclusion in this review and therefore meta-analysis for any of the treatment outcomes was not performed.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-06 21:59:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer A Dawson">
<P>There was one small cross-over study that was included in this review. There is insufficient evidence to recommend either method of gavage feeding. A randomised trial is needed to evaluate the benefits and harms of push versus gravity bolus tube feeding in preterm infants. Infants should be stratified by gestational age at birth (above and below 32 weeks) or birth weight (above and below 1500 grams) and respiratory support (ventilated versus non-ventilated) and the sample size should be of sufficient size to evaluate the primary outcomes outlined in this review (time to establish full tube feeds and feeding intolerance).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-06 20:41:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer A Dawson">
<P>Many small, sick and premature infants are unable to coordinate suck, swallow and breathing, and require gavage feeding. In gavage feeding, milk feeds are delivered through a tube passed via the nose or mouth into the stomach. Nutritional management influences immediate survival as well as the subsequent growth and development of preterm and low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physiological effects of gavage feeding include a transient rise in postprandial oxygen consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Mukhtar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhtar 1982</LINK>), a decrease in oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krauss-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krauss 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blondheim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blondheim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 1995</LINK>), increase in heart rate (<LINK REF="REF-Mukhtar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhtar 1982</LINK>), decreased functional residual capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Heldt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heldt 1988</LINK>) and decreased lung volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Pitcher_x002d_Wilmott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitcher-Wilmott 1979</LINK>). It is postulated that these cardiorespiratory effects are related to the volume displacement caused by feeds introduced into the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1976</LINK>). Additionally, intermittent bolus gastric tube feeding (gavage feeding) may decrease cerebral perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Nelle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelle 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 08:53:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gavage milk feeds may be delivered by intermittent bolus, a continuous drip, or a slow infusion over one hour, with an interval of at least one hour until the next feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>). Interminttent bolus feeds can be given by push or gravity. A 'push feed' is defined as an intermittent bolus milk feed that is administered using a syringe to push milk into the infant's stomach. Alternatively, a 'gravity feed' is defined as an intermittent bolus milk feed when milk is poured into a syringe (using the syringe as a funnel) that is attached to an intra-gastric feeding tube, and the milk is allowed to drip into the infant's stomach by gravity (<LINK REF="REF-Stronati-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stronati 1982</LINK>). The flow of the milk feed is controlled by altering the height of the syringe. Lowering the syringe slows the milk flow, raising the syringe makes the milk flow faster (<LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane review has shown that small babies weighing less than 1500 grams that were fed by intermittent bolus (push or gravity) compared with continuous infusion found no difference in time to achieve full oral feeds, growth, days to discharge or the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-03 08:54:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer A Dawson">
<P>The authors of two neonatal textbooks recommend that bolus gavage tube feeds should be given slowly, preferably by gravity (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sun-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 1998</LINK> strongly recommends against injecting fluid (milk) under pressure and similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Cox-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1982</LINK> states 'feeding is never<I> </I>injected under pressure'. The reasoning behind these authors' recommendations is not provided. <LINK REF="REF-Chinn-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 1971</LINK>, argued that a preterm infant does not always have the "advantage of esophageal peristalsis". In addition, "stomach and intestinal peristalsis depend on the presence of fluid in the stomach". She reported that feeding by gravity stimulates the physiological response of peristalsis as seen in the slight fluctuation of the formula level in the syringe. <LINK REF="REF-Chinn-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 1971</LINK> asserted that the 'forced-syringe (push method) of gavage feeding is more likely to result in milk being given too rapidly. This in turn, interferes with oesophageal peristalsis and results in oesophageal regurgitation (<LINK REF="REF-Barrie-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrie 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leidig-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leidig 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haxhija-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haxhija 1998</LINK>). In addition, fast gastric filling may also lead to greater vagal stimulation leading to bradycardia and apnoea, especially in low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kindley-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindley 1980</LINK>). Conversely, <LINK REF="REF-Ziemer-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziemer 1978</LINK> argued that some pressure must be exerted as gravity is generally insufficient to administer an entire feed. In an experimental laboratory study <LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK> reported that intermittent gravity feeding may result in an infant being fed a new feeding before the infants has digested the previous feed if the feed is delivered slowly. Nurses who declare a preference for either method of intermittent gavage feeding claim that with their preferred method they can more easily control the speed at which milk is delivered to the infant.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-26 12:17:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer A Dawson">
<P>Since the 1960s there has been disparate recommendations and inconsistency in practice regarding which method of intermittent bolus gavage tube feeding (push or gravity) is the most efficacious in relation to the establishment of full gavage feeding without adverse effects. Choice appears to be primarily based on personal preference, unit policy, or tradition. In a survey of neonatal units in the United Kingdom, the method of bolus feeding varied with some units declaring a preference for push feeds while others preferred the gravity method of feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Symon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Symon 1994</LINK>). We noted significant variation in gavage feeding while examining individual unit protocols published online. Those units that This variation in practice is also demonstrated by a number of researchers who have used either the push (<LINK REF="REF-Barrie-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrie 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heldt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heldt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leidig-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leidig 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grant-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelle 1997</LINK>) or gravity method (<LINK REF="REF-Kindley-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindley 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blondheim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blondheim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moscha-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscha 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK>) for bolus gavage feeding in their clinical studies.</P>
<P>Because intermittent bolus gavage feeding is a common practice in neonatal intensive care and special care baby nurseries, it is important to determine the clinical risks and benefits of each method of feeding to enable clinicians to make informed decisions regarding the most appropriate feeding method for an individual infant. Therefore, a systematic review of trials that compares the two methods of milk feeding was performed.</P>

<P>Where the trials involved clustered randomisation, we anticipated that study investigators would have presented their results after appropriately controlling for clustering effects (robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If it was unclear whether a cluster randomised trial had used appropriate controls for clustering, the study investigators would have been contacted for further information.

Following this, effect sizes and standard errors would have been meta-analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If appropriate controls were not used and individual participant data were not available, statistical guidance would have been sought from the Cochrane Method Group and external experts as to which method to apply to the published results in attempting to control for clustering. If there was insufficient information to control for clustering, outcome data would have been entered into RevMan using individuals as the unit of analysis, and then sensitivity analysis would have been used to assess the potential bias from inadequately controlled clustered trials (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2001</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 10:44:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer A Dawson">
<P>Gavage feeding is commonly used when infants are unable to suck and swallow feeds due to prematurity, low birthweight, or other conditions. Gavage feeds can be given intermittently using push or gravity methods. Intermittent bolus feedings are considered to be more physiologic than continuous feedings because they simulate a more normal feeding pattern and allow for cyclical surges in gut hormones 
(<LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1990</LINK>). Continuous gavage feedings are more commonly considered in very premature infants with severe respiratory distress, or in infants who have shown a previous intolerance of intermittent feedings as evidenced by severe reflux and/or persistent pre-feed gastric residuals. However a Cochrane review has shown that small babies weighing less than 1500 grams that were fed by intermittent bolus (push or gravity) compared with continuous infusion found no difference in the time to reach full feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2011</LINK>). There was no subgroup analysis of the type of intermittent feeding, push versus gravity, in included studies.</P>
<P>One small quasi-randomised controlled trial comparing push and gravity intermittent gavage feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Symon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Symon 1994</LINK>) found a trend towards a higher respiratory rate at 10 to 30 minutes following gavage feeds administered using the push method. Conversely <LINK REF="STD-Symon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Symon 1994</LINK> reported a significantly higher heart rate following gravity gavage feeding. It is important to note that Symon reported the statistical significance of the effect of feeding method on heart rate <I>within</I> each of the groups. He did not compare the effect of feeding method on respiratory and heart rate <I>between </I>groups.</P>
<P>There are confounding factors that might effect the speed of a feed, these include the diameter of the feeding tube, the type of materials used in the manufacture of the tube, and the type of feed administered. When using the gravity method the height of the syringe above the baby will effect the speed of the feed.</P>
<P>We found little evidence to support the optimal speed for gavage feeding. Small sick infants may be prone to respiratory instability during intermittent gavage feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Blondheim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blondheim 1993</LINK>). Blondheim showed that gravity feeds given over 15 to 20 minutes by gravity, when compared with continuous tube feeds, reduced adverse effects after feeding. They did not measure the effect of push feeds. In the Symon study, feeds were not timed to last a specific number of minutes and seconds but were given in what the single observer felt to be a 'safe manner', however, there was little difference in the time taken to give the feeds regardless of the method used (1.38 ml/kg/min push feeds and 1.39 ml/kg/min gravity feeds). The University of Manitoba guidelines recommend that the infusion rate of a bolus feed should be no faster than 2 ml per minute for smaller feeding volumes. When a larger volume of bolus feed is given this should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. However, a small and large volume is not defined. Further advice when administering a feed via gravity is to position the syringe so that the feed infuses slowly (<LINK REF="REF-University-of-Manitoba-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">University of Manitoba 2007</LINK>). If the push method is given then it should be pushed slowly. Sankar recommends that feeding should take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete (<LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2008</LINK>). Whilst these recommendations seem sensible they are not evidence based.</P>
<P>The internal diameter, or bore, of the feeding tube will have an effect on the speed of feed and may influence the choice of whether a bolus feed is given by push or gravity. Ziemer favours push feeding when a small diameter feeding tube is used. She states that gravity is generally insufficient to administer an entire feeding and some pressure must be exerted because of the small lumen of the feeding tube (<LINK REF="REF-Ziemer-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziemer 1978</LINK>). In a laboratory study Pagano showed that using a 6 fg tube without changing any other conditions (height above the infant and type of feed) resulted in a faster feeding time than using a 5 fg tube (<LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The height of the feeding tube above the infant is an important factor in determining the speed of a feed. Increasing the height will increase the force of gravity, as the height of feeding is increased the feed will be given at a faster rate (<LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK>). There is little evidence regarding the optimum height of the tube when giving a bolus feed by gravity. Chin recommends that the height should not exceed eight inches above the infant's head (<LINK REF="REF-Chinn-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 1971</LINK>). Symon controlled for tube size and height above the tube above infants in his cross-over study, all study feeds were given with a standard length size 5 fg feeding tube (<LINK REF="STD-Symon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Symon 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of feed administered can have an effect on the speed of the feed. Pagano compared flow rates for artificial formula against human breast milk and fortified human breast milk. She showed that human breast milk had the fastest flow rate. Milks with increased calorie contents were the slowest. The type of milk administered in the Symon study is not described (<LINK REF="STD-Symon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Symon 1994</LINK>). Polyurethane feeding tubes compared to silicone tubes result in feeds given at a faster rate (<LINK REF="REF-Pagano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagano 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the paucity of evidence, clinical practice guidelines give clinicians recommendations regarding administering a bolus feeding only by gravity (<LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2008</LINK> ) or via push or gravity (<LINK REF="REF-University-of-Manitoba-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">University of Manitoba 2007</LINK>). This systematic review has not established which method of intermittent gavage feeding has better outcomes. Future studies should enrol preterm and low birth weight infants who require intermittent gavage feeding. Important outcomes would include those specified in our criteria for considering studies for this review.</P>

<P>Intermittent bolus gavage feeding is a common practice in neonatal intensive care and special care baby nurseries. A randomised controlled trial is needed to evaluate the benefits and harms of push versus gravity bolus gavage feeding in preterm infants. Infants should be stratified by gestational age at birth (above and below 32 weeks) or birth weight (above and below 1500 g). Subgroup analysis should include size of enteral feeding tube, position of the infant and speed at which the feed is delivered.</P>
<P>The sample should be of sufficient size to be able to evaluate the primary outcomes outlined in this review (time to establish full tube feeds and feeding intolerance).</P>
