<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:00:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Many people are poisoned by carbon monoxide gas each year, either intentionally (e.g. in suicide attempts) or by accident. Carbon monoxide interferes with oxygen transport in the body, and can also directly damage a variety of organs including the brain. The usual treatment involves removing the affected person from the source of the gas, general supportive care, and administering oxygen which hastens the elimination of carbon monoxide from the body. High pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is only available at a few hospitals, and it is sometimes used to speed this process even further. However, the review of published trials found conflicting, potentially biased, and generally weak evidence regarding the usefulness of hyperbaric oxygen for the prevention of neurological injury.</P>

<P>Poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) remains an important cause of accidental and intentional injury worldwide. Several unblinded non-randomized trials have suggested that the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) prevents the development of neurological sequelae. This has led to the widespread use of HBO in the management of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-21 11:27:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched June 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to June 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to June 2010, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to June 2010, ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to June 2010.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-22 10:50:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Seven randomised controlled trials of varying quality were identified; one was excluded because it did not evaluate clinical outcomes. Of the six remaining trials involving 1361 participants, two found a beneficial effect of HBO for the reduction of neurologic sequelae at one month, while four others did not. One of these is an incomplete publication (an abstract of an interim analysis). Although pooled random effects meta-analysis does not suggest a significant benefit from HBOT (OR for neurological deficits 0.78, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.12), significant methodologic and statistical heterogeneity was apparent among the trials, and this result should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, design or analysis flaws were evident in all trials. Importantly, the conclusions of one positive trial may have been influenced by failure to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, while interpretation of the other positive trial is hampered by a high risk of bias introduced during the analysis including an apparent change in the primary outcome. Both were also stopped early 'for benefit', which is likely to have inflated the observed effect. In contrast three negative trials had low power to detect a benefit of HBO due to exclusion of severely poisoned patients in two and very poor follow-up in the other. One trial that was said to be finished around eight years ago has not reported the final analysis in any forum.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-03 05:10:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Existing randomised trials do not establish whether the administration of HBO to patients with carbon monoxide poisoning reduces the incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes. Additional research is needed to better define the role, if any, of HBO in the treatment of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. This research question is ideally suited to a multi-center randomised controlled trial.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-22 16:03:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-21 22:37:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas generated during the incomplete combustion of carbon-based compounds. Poisoning with CO remains an important cause of accidental and intentional injury worldwide. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 1,000&#8722;2,000 accidental deaths due to carbon monoxide exposure each year, resulting from an estimated 50,000 annual exposures (<LINK REF="REF-Hampson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-21 22:36:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pathophysiology of carbon monoxide poisoning is incompletely understood. Upon exposure, CO binds to haemoglobin with an affinity 210 times than of oxygen and also increases the affinity of the remaining sites for oxygen. Thus it decreases both the oxygen-carrying and oxygen-delivery capacity of blood. In addition to generating carboxyhaemoglobin, carbon monoxide has been shown to lead to harm by several other mechanisms including direct disruption of cellular oxidative processes by binding to myoglobin and cytochromes, and during recovery there is marked oxidative stress and inflammatory responses (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2009</LINK>). Both the direct hypoxic effects and the subsequent oxidative stress and inflammatory processes lead to varying degrees of end-organ damage, and occasionally death. The severity of poisoning is a function of the duration of exposure and the ambient concentration of CO, and the underlying health status of the exposed individual. Although useful for diagnosis when detected, the initial carboxyhaemoglobin level correlates poorly with outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hampson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two syndromes are recognized to occur after acute CO poisoning: persistent neurologic sequelae (PNS) and delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2009</LINK>). The former is characterized by symptoms or signs attributable to CO poisoning that are evident immediately following poisoning. These may improve, although not always to the premorbid state. The latter is characterized by the development of new symptoms or signs referable to CO poisoning, occurring after a period of days to weeks. This deterioration may be abrupt and dramatic. In both instances, however, the signs and symptoms can be non-specific, and the entities may be difficult to distinguish from each other. The symptoms and signs range from subtle personality changes, mood disorders and memory loss to (much less commonly) focal neurological injuries and other severely disabling manifestations of hypoxic brain injury. The definitions for this outcome in clinical studies have varied considerably. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-21 22:37:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) refers to the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures higher than atmospheric pressure. This is performed in a hyperbaric chamber. However, there are a very wide range of protocols used in the treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning involving different pressures, durations, and repeated treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Hampson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hampson 2006</LINK>), and this variation is also apparent in the RCTs in this review.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-02-21 22:28:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard treatment for CO poisoning includes removal from the site of exposure, administration of supplemental oxygen, and general supportive care (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2008</LINK>). The elimination half-life of carboxyhaemoglobin (approximately 320 minutes in room air) is shortened approximately five-fold by the administration of 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure (normobaric oxygen, NBO). The administration of HBO further hastens the elimination of carboxyhaemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Jay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jay 1997</LINK>). Animal studies have demonstrated benefits of HBO on a range of parameters including learning and memory (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Thom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2006</LINK>); although other animal studies have shown equal effects from NBO and HBO on such parameters (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bunc-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunc 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilmer 2002</LINK>). </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-21 21:55:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several unblinded, non-randomised trials and case series suggested that the use of HBO prevents the development of PNS and/or DNS. These observations led some clinicians to use HBO for selected patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, although there is considerable variability in clinical practice. Because HBO is available at only a few hospitals (necessitating the transfer of potentially unstable patients), is substantially more expensive than NBO, and is occasionally complicated by barotrauma (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2009</LINK>), seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2009</LINK>), pulmonary edema (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2001</LINK>) and claustrophobia, its superiority over NBO in this setting should be established (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2008</LINK>). This review was undertaken to examine the effect of HBO on the development of neurologic symptoms due to CO poisoning one month after treatment.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-02-07 05:06:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main outcome measure of interest was the presence of signs or symptoms possibly indicative of neurologic injury at follow-up (approximately 4 to 6 weeks) after randomisation. No universally accepted criteria exist for the diagnosis of persistent neurologic sequelae (PNS) or delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS) and outcomes were defined and measured differently in each study. In the absence of a well-defined, mutual outcome measure for all studies, we retained the definitions of neurologic sequelae presented by investigators in their reports.</P>
<P>The signs and symptoms were often non-specific and included headache, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances, ataxia, and difficulty with memory and executive processing, all of which are plausibly related to CO exposure. All studies simply reported neurological sequelae as present or absent at specified times of follow-up. While it is possible that HBO may also reduce the severity of neurologic sequelae among affected persons, no trials formally compared severity ratings or other non-dichotomised measures of function between NBO and HBO-treated patients.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-02-22 16:03:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The methods used in the review have been updated since publication of the protocol, to reflect revised guidance from The Cochrane Collaboration. The following items were assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).<BR/>&#8226; Was there adequate sequence generation?<BR/>&#8226; Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>&#8226; Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?<BR/>&#8226; Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>&#8226; Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>&#8226; Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias?</P>
<P>Two authors (EL, MHB) independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study against these criteria. Studies that did not adequately address these criteria were considered at high risk of bias. Authors were not blinded with respect to study authors, institution, or journal. The authors resolved disagreements by consensus, with a third author (NB) to be consulted if disagreements persisted.</P>
<P>Where the method of allocation concealment was not reported, or where additional information was required to appropriately assess study quality, the principal authors of these trials were contacted for clarification. We contacted the authors of four studies and received two replies; however, the responses did not uniformly clarify our questions.</P>

The extensive delay to date raises questions as to whether this trial will ever be published.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning was generally made by a history of exposure to carbon monoxide and an elevated carboxyhaemoglobin level. The severity of CO poisoning varied in the individual trials. Two studies stratified randomisation according to whether or not there was a history of loss of consciousness (<LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1989</LINK>). In the earlier of these (<LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1989</LINK>), only patients with no initial loss of consciousness were randomised to HBO vs. NBO, while in the latter (<LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK>), patients with transient loss of consciousness were randomised to HBO vs. NBO. In both of these studies, patients with more marked impairment of consciousness were randomised to different doses of HBO; these patients were not considered in this review. Two trials only enrolled patients with no loss of consciousness or cardiovascular instability (<LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1995</LINK>), while two other trials included all patients with CO poisoning regardless of severity (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Each principal investigator confirmed that virtually all patients received treatment with supplemental oxygen prior to randomisation, which would be considered standard practice.</P>
<P>The patients, interventions, completeness of follow-up and outcomes assessment varied significantly among the trials (see section on included studies for full details). Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>) employed 'sham dives', exposing control subjects to NBO in a hyperbaric chamber.</P>
<P>The duration, timing, and dose of both HBO and NBO also varied greatly among studies. Two studies from the same unit (<LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1989</LINK>) used an active treatment of HBO at 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for two hours followed by 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure for four hours, while the control group received 100% oxygen for six hours. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1995</LINK>) varied the intensity of HBO in the active treatment arm, using 2.8 ATA for 0.5 hours followed by 2 ATA for 1.5 hours. In this trial the control group received 100% oxygen at 1 ATA for a variable duration (mean = 4.2 hours). A trial published thus far only as an interim analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>), randomised patients to HBO at 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes or NBO for 12 hours. In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>), patients in the active treatment arm received three sessions of HBO, including an initial treatment of 3 ATA for 1 hour followed by 2 ATA for 1 hour, with two additional 2-hour treatments of 2 ATA at 6-12 hour intervals. Controls underwent sham dives with NBO at 1 ATA.</P>
<P>The intervention in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>) was unusual and substantially different from other studies. Patients randomised to active treatment received HBO at 2.8 ATA for 60 minutes followed by 100% oxygen by face mask for 40 minutes, but were then administered high-flow oxygen for the remainder of the day. This sequence was repeated daily for a total of three days. A further 28% received three additional treatments because they were deemed to have a poor outcome. The control group was treated with 100% NBO for 100 minutes followed by high-flow oxygen, repeated daily for three days. Thereafter, 15% underwent the same three-day regimen repeated because they were felt to have a poor outcome.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-02-21 22:12:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All included trials were at considerable risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). One study had very limited reporting of methods as it was published only as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>). It is unclear why this negative study (at the interim analysis) has never been published in full but the risk of bias from this study must be judged to be consequently very high. Four studies including this one had minimal or no blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1995</LINK>) and all participants and study personnel were probably aware of allocation. In these trials double-blinding was not possible as the control patients did not enter a hyperbaric chamber and the possibility of performance, attrition or detection bias is particularly strong as the main outcomes were the patient's reports of new symptoms. </P>
<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>) stipulated that patients and outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation. This was facilitated by sham treatments in the hyperbaric chamber. However these studies had other factors that indicated there was still a high risk of bias. Even for these blinded studies, it would have been relatively easy for those conducting the analysis to identify treatment arms in light of specific adverse events seen with hyperbaric therapy, which would be much more common in that treatment arm of the trials. It appears that a large risk of bias was introduced during analysis in both these trials. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>), numerous assumptions were applied, all of which favour HBO. These include well documented changes in the primary outcome as well as the diagnostic thresholds for their definition of neurologic sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2005a</LINK>). A detailed exposition of these is available in the Risk of bias tables in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. In the other blinded study, multiple analyses were applied without statistical adjustment reaching a tenuous conclusion that HBO increased the rate of DNS in one sub-group (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>). Each of the studies published in full adequately outlined the numbers of patients lost to follow-up and reasons for this. However, follow-up was particularly poor in this negative study (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>), in which only 46% of subjects were evaluated one month after treatment.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:05:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The six trials enrolled a total of 1997 patients, of whom 1335 were randomised to either HBO or NBO and had outcomes recorded. The severity of CO poisoning, the treatment regimens, and outcome assessment varied significantly among trials.</P>
<P>The prevalence of persistent signs or symptoms of CO poisoning (as defined by the investigators) at 4 to 6 weeks following treatment was 202 of 691 (29%) patients treated with HBO, compared with 219 of 644 (34%) patients treated with NBO. In a pooled analysis using a random effects model, no statistically significant reduction in neurologic sequelae was associated with HBO treatment (OR 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), although the point estimate favoured treatment. Simple pooling of trial results with a confidence interval should not be taken to be a true estimate of the predicted effects of treatment expected in future studies or individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>). The methodologic and statistical heterogeneity among the various trials and the high risk of bias in all studies even further increase the uncertainty around any estimate, well beyond that provided by statistical techniques.</P>
<P>Sub-group analyses of specific groups of patients (e.g. those with more severe poisoning, those with deliberate self-poisoning, or those who received treatment relatively early) was not possible because individual patient characteristics and outcomes could not be determined from each study.</P>
<P>Detailed review of the trials and, where available, earlier published abstracts of interim analyses, identified several aspects that warrant interpretive caution with regard to the reported effect of the interventions in individual studies (also see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>):</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1989</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK>
<BR/>These trials found no benefit from HBO over NBO, but the investigators only permitted less severely poisoned patients to be randomised to HBO or NBO. Because interventions are, in general, most likely to show benefit in patients with more severe disease, the possibility of type II error in these trials is high. Consequently, this trial does not disprove a benefit of HBO, particularly in more severely poisoned patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1995</LINK>
<BR/>This study was the first published RCT to claim a benefit from the use of HBO, however it was very small and outcome assessment was performed by unblinded clinicians. The statistical analysis raises several issues that all substantially increase the likelihood of a type I error. These include a failure to adjust the level of significance for an interim analysis and multiple comparisons, implausibly high levels of statistical significance (P&lt;0.005) presented at the interim analysis, and the trial's seemingly premature termination based upon the main analysis. (Although no sample size calculation was reported, no power calculation would have led to the design of such a small trial for this outcome.)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>
<BR/>This trial is reported only as an interim analysis. Although no statistically significant difference in neurologic symptoms was found between treatment arms at 1 month (26% with NBO vs. 22% with HBO), a difference was reported at 3 months (15% vs. 9%; P=0.016). No significant difference was reported at 6 months follow-up (10% vs. 6% respectively; P= 0.09) or 1 year (5% vs. 4% respectively), although the final results of this trial have yet to be reported in any forum. Of note, this trial is sometimes characterized as demonstrating a benefit to HBO (<LINK REF="REF-Hampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2002</LINK>) based solely upon the interim analysis findings at 3 months, despite a lack of adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing and the absence of a significant difference at other intervals.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This is the only negative study published to date in which control patients received sham treatment in a hyperbaric chamber. The trial enrolled a relatively large number of patients with attempted suicide, and patients in both arms of the trial were treated with continuous normobaric oxygen for 3 days, which is not generally accepted as standard practice. The most serious threat to the interpretation of this study is that only 46% of patients randomised to treatment were followed up at 4 to 6 weeks. Because of the strong possibility that patients lost to follow-up were systematically different from those in whom follow-up testing was obtained, the results of this trial are difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>
<BR/>This is the only positive study published to date in which control patients received sham treatment in a hyperbaric chamber. While the technical aspects of the conduct of this trial (e.g. blinding, randomisation, allocation concealment, high follow-up) are clearly superior to previously published trials and the effect size of HBO appears large, this trial's interpretation is hampered by the high risk of bias introduced during analysis. First, although the final publication (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>) describes a primary outcome of all neurologic sequelae, the originally intended endpoint was delayed neurologic sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1995</LINK>) and subsequent reports indicate there was no significant difference for this outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2005</LINK>). Second, the thresholds for the definition of neurologic sequelae itself changed between the interim analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1995</LINK>) and the final publication (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>), in which non-specific symptoms were the primary determinant of a statistical difference between treatments. In the final publication (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>), neuropsychological testing identified no difference between HBO and NBO; indeed, the mean neuropsychological testing scores for patients treated with NBO were within the normal range. It is probable that additional bias was introduced in the analysis from the drop-out and last observation carried forward assumptions for 6, 26 and 52 week outcomes and the premature termination of the trial "for benefit", all of which increased estimates of the magnitude of benefit for HBO. [Note that although the interim and efficacy analyses were performed blind to the assignment, the very different chamber-related adverse event rates in the two arms suggest that anyone with access to the comparison of the rates of these outcomes would have been able to identify treatment allocation.]</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-21 11:37:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This systematic review identified all published randomised controlled trials of HBO vs. NBO for the treatment of acute carbon monoxide poisoning. The six included trials enrolled patients with carbon monoxide poisoning of varying severity, employed different regimens of hyperbaric and normobaric oxygen, had varying degrees of follow-up, and were subject to various biases and analytical flaws that may have substantially influenced their conclusions. Only two of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>) were conducted in a double-blind fashion, and none reported clinically significant long-term outcomes. HBO has potential to cause harm as well as benefit. This includes the expected and well-known common bariatric and hyperoxic adverse effects. The significantly worse outcomes with 2 vs. 1 HBO treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Annane-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Annane 2010</LINK> - Trial B (excluded from this review)) suggests the possibility that in some circumstances HBO might even worsen the risk of neurological sequelae.</P>
<P>Although we present a pooled analysis of these six studies suggesting no statistically significant difference between HBO and NBO (OR 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.12), we caution that the methodologic and statistical heterogeneity of the six trials renders this analysis difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>). Subanalyses by severity, intent, and duration of poisoning were not possible. The overall non-significant difference is not dependent on the data from any single study, a meta-analysis of any 5 of the studies or just the 5 published in full remains non-significant.</P>
<P>During the course of this review we also identified several publications authored by recognized content experts. These often promoted the use of HBO based on the results of the two positive trials (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK>) and, occasionally, the 3-month interim analysis of Mathieu's study (<LINK REF="REF-Hampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2002</LINK>) without addressing the limitations set forth above. We acknowledge that many in the hyperbaric medicine community strongly advocate the position that HBO has been established as effective (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Stoller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoller 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2009</LINK>, <A HREF="http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9585#9585">http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9585#9585</A>;  <A HREF="http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9569#9569">http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9569#9569</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Logue-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logue 2008</LINK>), and that further placebo-controlled studies are therefore unethical. Other groups disagree with that position, explicitly (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2010</LINK>) or implicitly (<LINK REF="REF-Vanden-Hoek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanden Hoek 2010</LINK>) calling for additional clinical trials.  Based on the extreme heterogeneity of results from published clinical trials and the significant limitations of these trials, as detailed above, we believe that additional placebo-controlled clinical trials of HBO for the treatment of CO poisoning are ethical, warranted, and necessary.  It should be noted that, at present, no registered trials meeting our inclusion criteria are currently in progress.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:06:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-07 05:56:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Existing randomised controlled trials of HBO vs. NBO in the treatment of non-pregnant adults with acute carbon monoxide poisoning provide conflicting results regarding the efficacy of HBO. All published studies have limitations that threaten and may invalidate their conclusions.</P>
<P>Based on the results of these trials, HBO cannot be routinely recommended for the treatment of CO poisoning. It is possible that some patients, particularly those with more severe poisoning, may derive benefit from treatment, but this remains unproven. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:06:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Additional research is needed to further define the role, if any, of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning in various subsets of patients. Because carbon monoxide poisoning occurs commonly in diverse settings, this research is ideally suited to a multi-centre randomised trial. Given the heterogeneity of results in the published trials, we believe equipoise for such a trial exists.</P>
<P>In order to minimize bias, future studies should employ a triple-blind technique (investigators, patients, and outcome assessors) using sham dives in a hyperbaric chamber for control subjects (as in <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Scheinkestel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scheinkestel 1999</LINK>). However, in order to minimise the impact of any inadvertent unblinding during analysis, the trial should be prospectively registered with explicit definitions of primary and secondary outcomes and monitored in an ongoing fashion by an independent data monitoring committee.</P>
<P>The use of meaningful clinical outcomes is encouraged, while multiple hypothesis testing should be minimized unless investigators make appropriate statistical adjustments to minimize inflation of the type I error rate. Stratified analyses of several clinically important patient subgroups (including those with deliberate self-poisoning, impaired consciousness, and those treated shortly after exposure) should be conducted; these should also be pre-specified.</P>
<P>Importantly, given the absence of reliable evidence that patients with severe CO poisoning benefit from HBO therapy, exclusion of such patients from future trials is not justified. Indeed, the potential to demonstrate any effects of treatment is greatest in this population, because they are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Prospective, randomised unblinded trial. Similar to the earlier trial by the same investigators, randomisation was stratified by history of "transient loss of consciousness" vs. "initial coma". Patients without impaired consciousness were excluded. Patients with "transient loss of consciousness" were randomised to HBO vs NBO ("Trial A") and are included in this review. A separate group of patients with &#8220;initial coma&#8221; was randomised to receive 1 vs. 2 HBO treatment sessions (&#8220;Trial B&#8221;), and are not considered in this review.</P>
<P>The terms &#8220;transient loss of consciousness&#8221; and &#8220;initial coma&#8221; were defined by the authors as follows: &#8220;Eligible patients were classified by [the] attending physician into those who experienced transient loss of consciousness (malaise, syncope; trial A) or coma as confirmed by a household member or a rescuer (trial B).&#8221; &#8220;Coma was defined as a Glasgow coma score of &lt;8. Transient loss of consciousness or malaise or syncope was defined as normal consciousness at the time the patient was rescued and he/she could not recall what happened and/or reported that he/she had loss [of] consciousness." However, the definitions were difficult to apply; 14 people with initial impaired consciousness were unable to be classified into either group and were excluded from both studies, 6 patients randomised in Trial A should have been randomised in Trial B, and 12 patients randomised in Trial B should have been randomised in Trial A.</P>

<P>179 patients &#8805; 15 years of age presenting for therapy between Oct 1989 and Jan 2000 within 12 hours of exposure with a COHb of &gt;5% if a non-smoker or &gt;10% if a smoker and a history of transient (but not sustained) loss of consciousness. Key exclusion criteria included: suicide attempt, non-domestic poisoning, inhalation of smoke or other toxic gasses other than CO, and pregnancy.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:08:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>In "Trial A", patients with &#8220;transient loss of consciousness&#8221; were randomised to receive mask oxygen alone for 6 hours (NBO) or mask oxygen for 4 hours and HBO at 2.0 ATA for 120 minutes including 30 minutes compression/decompression. In addition, HBO patients received diazepam 10 mg IM.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-02-17 22:46:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary study endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete recovery 1 month after poisoning. Quote: &#8220;Complete recovery was defined as an absence of symptoms reported on the self-assessment questionnaire with a normal physical exam (including normal neuropsychological functions). These assessments were performed &#8220;by one intensive care physician qualified in neurology who remained blinded to patients&#8217; treatment arm,&#8221; or by the patient&#8217;s primary care physician. The type of neuropsychological testing employed and thresholds considered abnormal are not described. Sequelae were defined as &#8220;moderate&#8221; if they consisted of patient-reported symptoms only, and &#8220;severe&#8221; if any abnormalities were detected on examination. Key secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with persistent or delayed neurological sequelae and the proportion able to resume their former occupational activity. </P>
<P>No difference in the primary or key secondary outcomes were evident, with symptoms present in 33/79 (42%) HBO patients 29/74 (39%) of control patients one month after poisoning/treatment. These results remained statistically insignificant, with the point estimate slightly favouring NBO, following adjustment for sex, duration of intoxication, time to randomisation and initial COHb level.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2011-02-21 16:08:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This trial was originally reported in abstract in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Raphael-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raphael 2004</LINK>) and included in our previous review. The trial protocol was retrospectively added to a clinical trials registry (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov with number NCT01100515 for trial A). Some additional unpublished information was made available from a 1989 protocol provided by the authors. Trial stopped because interim analysis of Trial B indicated 2 x HBO treatments were inferior to one (47% with complete recovery vs 68% respectively). Trial A stopped at the same time as interim analysis indicated the results were close and suggested "futility of treatment continuation".</P>
<P>Although &#8220;trial B&#8221; of this study did not meet inclusion criteria for this review, it can be used to examine whether a dose/duration-response effect of HBO is apparent.  In &#8220;trial B&#8221; (a more seriously poisoned group than the above), the proportion of patients with residual symptoms 1 month after poisoning was greater among patients who received two HBO sessions (53%) than in those treated with one HBO session (32%), suggesting harm associated with an increased total duration of HBO.</P>

<P>Quote: "Patients in the normobaric-oxygen group were exposed to air at 1 atmosphere absolute (101.3 kPa, or sea-level pressure) for all three chamber sessions.

The first hyperbaric-oxygen treatment was stopped prematurely because of anxiety (in seven patients), tympanic-membrane rupture (in one patient), and cough (in one patient). The second or third hyperbaric-oxygen treatment was omitted due to difficulty with equalization of middle-ear pressure (in four patients) or failure to return for treatment (in one patient). The second or third normobaric-oxygen session was omitted because of failure to return (in three patients)."</P>

<P>4 - 6 week time point</P>
<P>Quote: "The five patients who did not have data on neuropsychological tests at six weeks were assumed to have cognitive sequelae at that time point."</P>
<P>Comment: This assignment of an adverse effect to those with incomplete data applied to 4 NBO patients and 1 HBO patient. This introduced a bias in favour of a beneficial effect of HBO. No sensitivity analysis was done to test whether the conclusions were sensitive to this assumption. This also has impact on interim analysis stopping rules given the p value for stopping was 0.01 and this level of significance was only just reached (i.e. the trial would not have stopped if this particular assumption had not been applied).</P>
<P>6 and 12 month time points:</P>
<P>Quotes from 2002 abstract:</P>
<P>"Although this RCT did not measure 6 and 12 month outcome, we had data from most of these RCT patients from a separate IRB-approved study permitting us to report outcome at 6 and 12 months post-CO poisoning."</P>
<P>"The analysis assumed a "favorable outcome" if: 1) No cognitive sequelae at all times (n=29-HB02//22-NB02); 2) 6-week cognitive sequelae present, but resolved by 12 months (n=5//9); 3) No cognitive sequelae at 6 weeks, and either no data at 6 or 12 months, and no cognitive sequelae present (n=13//8); or 4) Cognitive sequelae developing after 6 weeks was not due to the prior episode of CO poisoning (n=15//11)."</P>
<P>Comment: This abstract clarifies that those with documented normal results at the 12 month time point were 34 for HBO vs 31 for NBO and by adding the 4th group to the numbers reported in the NEJM paper those with documented abnormal results were 24 for HBO vs 29 for NBO (Neither of these results would be significant).</P>
<P>Quotes from NEJM paper:</P>
<P>"We also report rates of cognitive sequelae at 6 and 12 months, although these end points were not included in the study design."</P>
<P>"Cognitive sequelae present at 6 or 12 months were assumed not to be due to carbon monoxide poisoning if they had not been present at 6 weeks. Patients with cognitive sequelae at 6 weeks who had missing data at 6 or 12 months were assumed to have cognitive sequelae at those time points."</P>
<P>Comment: These two assumptions meant that any differences at the first time point were likely to be carried forward to all later analyses. So not only those who did not attend the 6 (n=35) and 12 (n=24) month assessments had the 6 week assessment carried forward, but so did those who had normal results at 6 weeks (57/76 (HBO) vs. 41/76 (NBO)).</P>
<P>"Cognitive sequelae at 6 months and 12 months were less frequent in the hyperbaric-oxygen group than in the normobaric-oxygen group, both according to the intention-to-treat analysis (P=0.02 at 6 months, P=0.04 at 12 months) and according to the efficacy analysis (P=0.03 at 6 months, P=0.08 at 12 months) (Table 2)."</P>

<P>Comment: The incomplete outcome data for the 4 to 6 week time point used in our meta-analysis are addressed satisfactorily, albeit with an assumption that favoured HBO. However, the same cannot be said for the 6 and 12 month data which as presented are largely a construct of the assumptions applied rather than based on the actual data (which would have shown there to be very little difference at these time points (i.e. 24 vs 29 abnormal rather than 14 vs 25)).</P>

<P>The trial was retrospectively registered after completion. The results are consistent with an abstract presented in 2004. All important clinical secondary outcomes were presented. However the original 1989 protocol (in French) suggested some other outcomes were to be recorded [paraphrased from translation of the unpublished protocol] "Assessment of outcomes would include....the fate of patients (back at home, convalescent and nursing homes), duration of hospitalisation, changes in muscle enzymes and liver function, chest x-ray changes, electrocardiogram changes including secondary manifestations (arrhythmias, conduction, appearance of disorders of repolarization, abnormal QRS complex) and electroencephalogram changes (possible outcome).</P>
<P>Comment: None of these outcomes were likely to be common in Trial A as the overall outcome was very good (only 1/179 patients not resuming former activity). The outcomes of interest to this review were reported in full.<BR/>

<P>Quote: "The only statistically significant difference between groups in neuropsychological performance was in the learning test at completion of treatment (Boxes 3 and 4); this was in favour of the NBO group for both 'all patients' (P= 0.01) and 'severely poisoned' patients (P=0.005)"</P>
<P>Quote: "NBO patients had a significantly lower number of abnormal test results at completion of treatment (all patients, 3.4 v. 2.7, p= 0.02; severely poisoned patients, 3.7 v. 2.6, P= 0.008) and, for those severely poisoned, there were fewer NBO patients with a poor outcome (85% v. 65%; P= 0.03). All five relapses (DNS) occurred in HBO patients (P= 0.03) at a median of 40 days (IQR, 29-81 days) after initial treatment; these patients then received a mean 4.5 (SD, 2.5) additional treatments. Although three of these patients improved with further treatments, all DNS patients had a poor outcome after re-treatment, with a mean 6.3 (SD, 1.2) abnormal test results."</P>
<P>Comments:</P>
<P>Several of these and other conclusions in text were based upon analysis of individual neuropsychological test results in one sub-group. However, there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons leading to a high likelihood of a Type I error.</P>
<P>There was no pre-specified primary outcome in the paper. The focus of most of the analysis on early outcomes (immediately post-treatment) contrasted with their stated aim to "to assess both persistent and delayed neurological sequelae (PNS and DNS)" and is likely to have been driven by necessity given the low follow up (and therefore post hoc).</P>

<P>Report Quote: "The primary outcome was the incidence of cognitive sequelae six weeks after randomisation."</P>
<P>1995 Quote: "As a point of information, we are presently performing a randomised controlled double-blind prospective clinical trial (RCT) in adult patients with acute CO poisoning. Our major question is, does HBO2 reduce the incidence of delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS)? Other questions this trial may answer include differences between the two therapies related to recovery rate, cost (including transport), and incidence and outcome of patients with persistent neurologic sequelae (PNS)". (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1995</LINK>)</P>
<P>1995 Interim analysis abstract: The numbers were reported for delayed, permanent and total sequelae but the only statistical test of significance ("P=0.0538") was applied to delayed neurological sequelae. Quote: "The RCT will continue since the difference in outcome between the two groups is insignificant (p&lt;0.0001 required at n=50; interim analysis)". (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1995a</LINK>)</P>
<P>2005 abstract: "Persistent neurocognitive sequelae was present in 9 patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen and 21 treated with normobaric oxygen (P=0.013); delayed neurocognitive sequelae was present in 9 treated with hyperbaric oxygen and 10 with normobaric oxygen (P=0.8)." (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>Comment: There was a clear change in the primary study outcome from what the authors described in 1995 and what they presented in the 2002 final report. The authors have not explained the change from DNS to total cognitive sequelae as the primary outcome or provided any reason for the change. This also has impact on the application of the interim analysis stopping rules (the trial would not have stopped if DNS were the outcome analysed).</P>
<P>Report quote: "A priori, cognitive sequelae were considered to be present if, at six weeks, any T score for a neuropsychological subtest was more than 2 SD below the mean of demographically corrected standardized T scores (normal population mean [±SD], 50±10) or if two or more T scores for sub-tests were more than 1 SD below the mean. If the patient reported difficulties with memory, attention, or concentration, then the T score on any neuropsychological subtest only had to be more than 1 SD below the mean of demographically corrected standardized T scores for cognitive sequelae to be considered to be present."</P>
<P>1995 Quote: "During the development of these two trials, it became evident that operational definitions of DNS and PNS were needed. Our operational definition for normal neuropsychologic CO screening battery is that all subtest scores fall within mean ± 1SD for each test when compared to demographically corrected standardised norms. Our definition for DNS is that development of a new neurologic abnormality not present at day 1, and/or decrement of neuropsychologic subtest score of more than 2 SD points below the mean or 2 subtest scores more than 1SD point below the mean compared to standardised norms (prior normal neuropsychologic test). If the prior neuropsychologic test is abnormal, then we use a decrement of an abnormal subtest of more than 1 SD point compared to the prior score or more than 0.5 SD points below each of at least 2 abnormal subtests.&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1995</LINK>)</P>
<P>2001 Quote: "Cognitive sequelae were considered present if any 6-wk neuropsychological subtest score was &gt;2 SD below the mean (or if at least two subtest scores were each more than 1 SD below the mean) of demographically corrected standardized scores. Cognitive sequelae were present if a neuropsychological subtest score was &gt;1 SD below the mean or if two subtest scores each were &gt;0.5 SD below the mean and the patient complained of memory, attention, and/or concentration difficulties. A normal neuropsychological test battery was present when each subtest score of the CO screening battery was &#8805;(mean - 1 SD)"</P>
<P>Comment: While not easy to work through these long paragraphs it is apparent that the defined thresholds for abnormal results changed on each occasion and that self-reported difficulties with memory, attention and concentration were added to the definition between 1995 and 2001/2.</P>
<P>[Note that given 6 different neuropsychological tests were used it is likely that most people would have either one of these tests &gt; 1 SD below the mean or 2 tests &gt; 0.5 SD below the mean by chance (regardless of any disease or an influence of treatment). Therefore, the reported differences in PNS between the groups is likely to have been the result of a difference in self-reported symptoms in the 2002 report. This would not have been the case for the definition of PNS described in 1995 because at that time there was no component of the outcome that related to self-reported symptoms].</P>
<P>Comment: Dr Weaver has previously responded to criticisms regarding the apparent change in the outcome definitions, stating that the earlier publications were all inaccurate, and that the only accurate record of outcomes is in the final 2002 report. http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9531#9531<BR/>

<P>Power/Sample size/stopping rules:</P>
<P>Quote: "Sample sizes for trial A and B were calculated separately. In trial A, assuming a 1 month recovery rate of 40% in the reference group (A0), 245 patients were needed per treatment arm to detect an absolute difference of at least 15% in recovery rates with a type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.10 using a two-sided test."</P>
<P>Quote: "One interim analysis was scheduled after inclusion of 300 patients to allow premature study termination if data suggested a large difference between treatment arms, serious treatment-related adverse events, difficulties in conducting the trial, or futility".</P>
<P>Quote: "The trial was terminated prematurely after the interim analysis (January 2000), based on a total of 385 patients, showing that, in comatose patients (trial B), the 1 month complete recovery rate was lower in the &#8216;&#8216;two HBO sessions&#8217;&#8217; arm compared to the &#8216;&#8216;one HBO session&#8217;&#8217; arm (47 vs. 68%, P = 0.007). Furthermore, in trial A patients, recovery rates were close (61% in control arm vs. 58% in experimental arm), suggesting futility of treatment continuation. Accordingly, we decided to terminate trial A also."</P>
<P>Comment: Trial A appears to have been stopped largely on the basis of the results from Trial B which was poorly justified. However, while this reduced the power of the study, it is unlikely to lead to a bias.</P>

<P>Comment: No power/sample size calculation or stopping rule was specified in the paper. There is no feasible power calculation that would have planned a study this size.

<P>Quote: "The trial was stopped after the third interim analysis, which included 150 patients, because hyperbaric oxygen was judged to be efficacious (P&lt;0.01)."</P>
<P>Quote: "We calculated that the inclusion of 100 patients in each treatment group would provide the study with a statistical power of 80 percent to detect the difference between the published rates of cognitive sequelae of 5.8 percent and 18.5 percent (with a two-sided probability of a type I error of 0.05). The Statistical Data Center at LDS Hospital planned and performed interim analyses after the six-week data were available from 50, 100, and 150 enrolled patients, using a stopping rule requiring a two-sided P value of 0.0001, 0.001, and<BR/>0.01, respectively, for the three analyses. The statisticians and investigators, who were blinded to patients&#8217; treatment-group assignments, had access to the results of the interim analyses."</P>
<P>Quote: "For all 152 patients in the intention-to-treat population, cognitive sequelae at six weeks were less frequent in the hyperbaric-oxygen group (25.0 percent) than in the normobaric-oxygen group (46.1 percent; unadjusted odds ratio, 0.39 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.78]; P=0.007) (Table 2). The same was true for the 147 patients with complete data on neuropsychological tests at six weeks: cognitive sequelae were less frequent at six weeks among patients who received hyperbaric-oxygen treatment (24.0 percent) than among those who received normobaric oxygen (43.1 percent, P=0.01)".</P>
