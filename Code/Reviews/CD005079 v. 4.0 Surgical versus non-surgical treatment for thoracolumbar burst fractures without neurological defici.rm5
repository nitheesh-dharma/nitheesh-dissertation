<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-20 20:29:04 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The thoracolumbar region of the spine is composed of the thoracic (middle back) and lumbar (lower back) spine. One type of spinal injury is the burst fracture where a vertebra (one of several bones making up the spine) is fractured (broken) such that it loses height on both its back and front sides. This sort of fracture occurs most frequently in the bones situated at the junction of the thoracic and lumbar spine. These injuries are usually the result of a high-velocity accident such as a motor vehicle crash. These are serious injuries, particularly when the spinal cord is also damaged as this may result in the partial or complete loss of sensory and motor function in the legs, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. This review only included people whose nerve tissue was not damaged, although later damage could not be ruled out. People are treated in hospital either conservatively by being placed in a lying position that reduces strain on that part of the spine followed by fitting a cast or brace so that they can move around, or surgically by stabilising the affected part of the spine using various implants and procedures.</P>
<P>We included data from two trials, which included 87 participants. The trials compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for these fractures in the thoracolumbar region of the spine. Both trials had limitations in their methods that could reduce the reliability of their results. They reported contrasting results for patient pain and function at a minimum of two years after treatment. One study found patients had less pain and better function after surgery compared with patients who did not have surgery. The other trial found the opposite. Both trials found there were more early complications in the surgical group and only participants of this group had subsequent additional surgery. This involved the removal of the implant either to resolve a complication or routinely. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.</P>
<P>Our review concluded that the weak evidence from these two trials was insufficient to say whether surgery or non-surgical treatment was better for these fractures. However, surgery is likely to be associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs.</P>

<P>Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-19 15:25:09 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.</P>
<P>The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.</P>

<P>The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-19 17:06:20 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Spinal burst fractures result from failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads, frequently associated with flexion loading. In the three column theory of spinal stability (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK>), the anterior column is composed of the anterior part of the vertebral body and its adjacent soft tissue complex; the middle column consists of the posterior half of the vertebral body and the soft tissue complex; and the posterior column is formed by the osseous and ligamentous structures posterior to the vertebral body.</P>
<P>Thoracolumbar burst fractures account for up to 17% of major spinal fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK>). Males are at four times higher risk than females. Motor vehicle accidents are the commonest cause of injury, followed by falls and sports-related injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Price-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1994</LINK>). Other organ system injuries occur in up to 50% of thoracolumbar trauma patients (<LINK REF="REF-Purcell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purcell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1988</LINK>). High-energy injuries associated with paraplegia have a 7% first-year mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Shikata-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shikata 1990</LINK>). The incidence of neurological deficit resulting from thoracolumbar burst fractures is estimated to be 50% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 1985</LINK>). Most of these fractures occur in the thoracolumbar junction section of the spine, which comprises one or more thoracic vertebrae (10th, 11th and 12th thoracic: T10, T11 and T12) and one or more lumbar vertebrae (first and second lumbar: L1 and L2) according to the various definitions in the literature. Common definitions of this section are T10 to L2, T11 to L2 and T12 to L2 (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 1985</LINK>). The junction forms a transition zone between the relatively fixed and kyphotic thoracic spine above and the relatively mobile and lordotic lumbar spine below, which causes stress forces to concentrate upon the thoracolumbar vertebral column and predisposes this area to injury (<LINK REF="REF-Gertzbein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertzbein 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical features of thoracolumbar fracture include acute back pain, limited motion, and swelling at the fracture site. Damage to the nerve root or spinal cord, or both, from protruding fragments of vertebral body may result in partial loss of sensory and motor function in the lower extremity or, in cases of severe disruption, may produce full paralysis, urinary and fecal incontinence, and permanent neurological injury. Characteristic radiological findings of the fractures include moderate to marked anterior wedging of the vertebral body, an increased interpedicular distance and narrowing of the spinal canal as a result of displacement of vertebral body fragments. Although many thoracolumbar spinal injuries do not result in paralysis, they may leave an unstable spinal segment due to disruption of bony elements and soft tissues. Late paralysis may result from the residual instability (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The classification of thoracolumbar injury remains controversial. <LINK REF="REF-Denis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1983</LINK> proposed a classification of thoracolumbar fractures into four types, based on the three column theory, and defined three patterns of instability. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft für osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification system, developed by Müller and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-OTA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">OTA 1996</LINK>) and subsequently updated (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2007</LINK>), has also been commonly applied in clinical practice. In 2005 a new classification system, the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS), was suggested by Vaccaro et al (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2005</LINK>) in which the classification of the thoracolumbar injury is based on three injury characteristics: 1) morphology of injury determined by radiographic appearance, 2) integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex, and 3) the neurological status of the patient. The calculation of thoracolumbar injury severity score is based on these characteristics, with a higher score indicating a more severe injury.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-19 17:13:19 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>In clinical practice, thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit are managed either non-surgically (conservative treatment) or surgically.</P>
<P>Non-surgical treatments include recumbent bed rest and postural reduction, followed by casting or bracing with early ambulation. In the traditional conservative management of unstable thoracolumbar injuries, the patient was confined to bed, with great attention paid to lordotic posture, for as long as six to eight weeks followed by gradual mobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Bedbrook-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedbrook 1975</LINK>). However, this regimen resulted in mortality rates as high as 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Bedbrook-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedbrook 1975</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Holdsworth-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdsworth 1970</LINK> recommended postural reduction of the deformity that resulted from the burst fracture, followed by hyperextension casting and patient mobilisation. This resulted in significantly improved morbidity and mortality rates. Postural reduction can produce an indirect decompression of the spinal canal, and a well-fitted cast or orthosis may also maintain reduction and lessen deformity while late neurologic deterioration is uncommon (<LINK REF="REF-Cantor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgery generally involves open reduction and stabilisation, using either a posterior or anterior approach. Sometimes surgery also involves decompression, where bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal are removed. One now dated technique using the posterior approach involved posterior reduction and stabilisation using the Harrington distraction rod system, a kind of long-segment fixation. <LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1978</LINK> demonstrated that this technique produced restoration of vertebral height at the injured level, reduction of the kyphosis, and spinal canal clearance to some degree. However, the instrumentation had some drawbacks. It required fixation of an extensive area of the spine, at least two levels caudal (lower) and three levels cephalad (higher) than the fracture. In addition, it offered only semirigid fixation, thus supplemental external support was often necessary. A more modern and more popular technique for internal fixation is posterior pedicle screw fixation. As summarised in the Cochrane review on pedicle screw fixation for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures, "pedicle screw fixation can be divided into several categories based on the lengths of the fixed segments and of pedicle screws in the injured vertebra" (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2013</LINK> refer to three main categories: short-segment fixation pedicle screw instrumentation where two pedicle screws are inserted above and below the fractured vertebra, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Dick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dick 1985</LINK>); long-segment pedicle screw instrumentation where four pedicle screws are inserted into four vertebrae, two above and two below the fractured vertebra, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Tezeren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tezeren 2005</LINK>); and monosegmental pedicle screw instrumentation, where pedicle screws are inserted at the level of the fracture and one level adjacent depending on the location of the intact endplate (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009</LINK>). Additional procedures include the use of autogenous bone grafts to fuse together adjacent segments (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-19 17:17:39 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The goals of treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures are to obtain early patient mobilisation and a painless, balanced, stable vertebral column with maximum spine mobility and optimal neurological function (<LINK REF="REF-Eskenazi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eskenazi 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical management offers the prospect of immediate stability, correction of deformity, early walking, reduced reliance on casts and braces, and theoretical protection against future neurological deterioration. However, this comes at the cost of surgery-related morbidity and risk of surgical complications such as infection, hardware-related problems and fixation failure (<LINK REF="REF-McLain-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLain 1993</LINK>), and iatrogenic injury. Advocates of conservative treatment cite cohort studies demonstrating good outcomes, low progression of deformity, less back pain than surgical treatment, satisfactory work status, low incidence of neurological deterioration, progressive bony remodeling and diminution of canal compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Cantor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1988</LINK>). Although some studies argue that the degree of kyphosis does not correlate to clinical outcomes, others have demonstrated a relationship between significant deformity (&gt; 30 degrees) and increased pain (<LINK REF="REF-Gertzbein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertzbein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1988</LINK>). Although in one study of non-surgical treatment, with poor follow-up, the incidence of late neurological deterioration was 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Denis-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denis 1984</LINK>) others have reported much lower rates of between 0% and 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Cantor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although the two included trials had many outcomes in common, their results were significantly heterogeneous for several of these and only limited pooling was performed. As none of the primary outcomes were reported as stipulated in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>, we presented alternatives from the same categories below. Final follow-up results (minimum two years in both trials) are presented below unless stated otherwise.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Both trials used a VAS to assess the degree of pain. However, the direction of pain intensity was in opposite directions: in <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK>, pain was measured using a VAS (0 mm = worst pain imaginable; 100 mm = no pain at all); and in <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>, pain was reported using a 10 cm VAS (0 = no pain; 10 cm = worst pain imaginable). The data from both trials were adjusted for presentation in the analyses so that they had the same direction of effect and scale. We calculated means and standard deviations based on the raw data given in the original articles (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two trials presented opposite and significantly heterogeneous results (Chi² = 8.90, df = 1 (P = 0.003); I² = 89%) for pain and thus we did not pool their data (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK>, the surgically-treated group had significantly less pain at final follow-up (MD -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37). <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK> found the converse, with the surgical group having more pain at final follow-up, although the effect did not reach statistical significance (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Function measured on a disability or quality of life scale</HEADING>
<P>Both trials used the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ-24) to estimate the functional disability at the time of pre-injury and at the last follow-up. We calculated the mean and standard deviation from the raw data given in the original articles (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The two trials presented opposite and significantly heterogeneous results (Chi² = 12.41, df = 1 (P = 0.0004); I² = 92%) and thus we did not pool their data (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK>, the surgical group had a statistically significantly lower mean RMDQ-24 score and thus less disability than the non-surgical group at follow-up (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64). In contrast, the surgical group in <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK> had a statistically significantly higher mean RMDQ-24 at follow-up (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK> also reported more favourable results in the surgical group for the VAS spine score at the final follow-up (MD 20.10 mm, 95% CI 5.13 to 35.07) (<I>see </I>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Return to work</HEADING>
<P>The two trials presented contrasting and heterogeneous results (Chi² = 5.51, df = 1 (P = 0.02); I² = 82%) for return to work and thus we did not pool these data (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK>, 11 of 13 working patients in the surgical group returned to their previous job whereas only five of 13 participants with an employment record in the non-surgical group resumed working. Of these five, three returned to the same profession and two changed careers for less physically demanding employment. On average, those in the surgical group returned to work sooner after their accident than those in the non-surgical group (6.7 months (range 1 to 18 months) versus 13.8 months (range 6 to 33 months)). In <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>, 10 of the 24 patients treated surgically returned to work within six months and a further four returned to work subsequently; of these, eight returned to a similar job and six changed to a less physically demanding occupation. In the non-surgical group, 17 of 23 patients resumed work within six months and a further two returned subsequently; of these, 15 returned to a similar job.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rate of subsequent surgery and complications</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>, two patients in the non-surgical group who were excluded from the analysis died from causes unrelated to their injuries before the final follow-up could be performed.</P>
<P>Only surgically-treated patients in both trials had subsequent surgery (implant removal) for complications (8/41 versus 0/38; RR 8.39, 95% CI 1.12 to 62.87) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Implant removal for the remaining surgical group patients in <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK> was scheduled after a period of nine to 12 months. In <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>, the complications rate in the surgical group was higher than in the non-surgical group (16/24 versus 3/23; RR 5.11, 95% CI 1.71 to 15.24). <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK> found no statistically significant difference between two groups (5/17 versus 3/15; RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.14). Pooled data using the random-effects model because of heterogeneity (Chi² = 2.20, df = 1 (P = 0.14); I² = 55%) showed a non-statistically significant trend favouring non-surgical treatment for overall complications (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK> reported local and regional sagittal angles; we have only reported on the former here. In the surgical group of this trial, the mean local sagittal angle decreased in the surgical group from 16.8 ° at admission to 8.6 ° at 4.3 years follow-up. Conversely, the mean local sagittal angle increased in the non-surgical group from 15.7 ° at admission to 19.8 ° at follow-up. This trial found significantly less kyophotic deformity after surgery at long-term follow-up (MD -11.20 °, 95% CI -15.50 ° to -6.90 °). In the group managed surgically in <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>, the mean kyphosis (according to the picture shown in the article the angles may have been the local sagittal angles) was 10.1 ° on admission and 13 ° at the time of the final follow-up (minimum of two years). In the non-surgical group, the mean kyphosis was 11.3 ° on admission and 13.8 ° at final follow-up.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:09:40 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The available evidence for comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar fractures without neurological deficit was limited to two small trials with a total of 79 participants available at a minimum of two years follow-up. Both trials were at risk of bias. Additionally, these trials produced contrasting results and the significant heterogeneity between the results for outcomes in common rendered meta-analysis inappropriate for all but overall complications and surgery for complications. <LINK REF="STD-Siebenga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Siebenga 2006</LINK> found superior pain, function and return to work outcomes for the surgical group, whereas the converse was true for <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2003</LINK>. There were greater numbers of participants with early complications in the surgical groups and only those in this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:10:48 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence is sparse and the two included trials are clinically heterogeneous. For instance, there was a difference in the range of fracture sites, although the majority fell into the same categories, and in the types of surgical and non-surgical interventions. It is impossible to judge the applicability of the contrasting results for pain and function from the two trials. However, the risk of subsequent surgery, entailing implant removal, and of early complications and higher initial costs after surgery are likely to apply more generally.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:11:55 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were some limitations in the design, implementation and reporting of the two included trials. Notably, both were at high risk of bias relating to performance and detection. The small sample sizes, clinical heterogeneity and contrasting results for patient-reported outcomes of pain and function of the two trials further limit the quality of the evidence.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:12:27 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were some limitations in the review process that may have resulted in potential biases. Firstly, we restricted study inclusion to those published in English or Chinese. Secondly, we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to get missing information from the trial investigators. Thirdly, similar to the first version of this review, our presented primary outcomes differ from those listed in <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>. This is unavoidable in terms of the available data but it also indicates that some appraisal of the outcomes may be warranted before the next update.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-20 20:37:13 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Gnanenthiran-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gnanenthiran 2012</LINK> included four trials, of which two were included in our review. One (<LINK REF="STD-Shen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 2001</LINK>) was excluded because of excessively compromised analysis, and the fourth study was not a randomised or quasi-randomised trial. Although acknowledging the clinical and statistical heterogeneity in the four studies, <LINK REF="REF-Gnanenthiran-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gnanenthiran 2012</LINK> decided to present the results for pain and functional outcomes. They concluded that there were no differences between the two intervention groups in pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores, and return to work rates. Similar to our findings, they found surgery was associated with higher complication rates and costs.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:17:05 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:15:13 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The available evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. There is some evidence, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery as well as greater initial healthcare costs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-19 18:17:05 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to inform practice in this area, there is a need for a large, multicentre, high quality and adequately reported randomised controlled trial that assesses the relative effects of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. In determining the inclusion criteria for such a trial, consideration should be given to the use of a contemporary, internationally recognised classification system for thoracolumbar fractures, such as the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2005</LINK>). The focus should be on collecting patient-reported outcome measures of pain and function, and severe complications leading to disability.</P>

<P>
<B>Participants:</B> 34 participants recruited between 1998 and 2002. 18 patients received surgical treatment and 16 patients received non-surgical therapy. There were 7 women and 10 men in the surgical group, the mean age was 45.7 years (27 to 59); 5 women and 10 men in the non-surgical group, the mean age was 37.3 years (18 to 58).</P>
<P>It is very likely that one of two hospitals was in the Netherlands and the other in Germany.</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion criteria:</B> Traumatic fracture of T10 to L4, AO Type A (compression fracture), no neurologic deficit (ASIA/Frankel E), age 18 to 60 years, and period between trauma and surgical treatment less than 10 days.</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B> Patients with AO Type A1.1 fracture, pregnancy, pathological or osteoporotic fracture, patients with end-stage disease (ASA IV), patients with a history of previous back surgery, patients with a recent psychiatric history, patients using drugs or other illegal substances, or patients presenting with any accompanying injury that might interfere with the treatment of the spine fracture or the mobilisation scheme after hospital discharge (i.e. lower extremity injuries prohibiting early weight-bearing motion).</P>
<P>
<B>Loss to follow-up:</B> Two patients were lost to follow-up. One left the hospital against medical advice and could not be contacted again. The other one was treated surgically but refused to co-operate further in this study. The remaining 32 patients (94%) completed at least 2-year functional and radiologic follow-up.</P>

<P>
<B>Surgical treatment (intervention):</B> The patients were managed with a short-segment posterior stabilisation using the titanium version of the Universal Spine System. Three days post-surgery, the patients were mobilised wearing a Jewett hyperextension orthosis for the next 3 months. A standardised physiotherapy scheme was followed. The same instructions with regard to activity and mobilisation were given as in the non-surgical treated group.</P>
<P>
<B>Non-surgical treatment (control):</B> The patients were treated with a rehabilitation course on a Circ-O-Lectric or Rotorest bed. After resting on a horizontal bed for a minimum period of 5 days, the patients began a standardised physiotherapy scheme to train trunk musculature. Nadroparine was given daily as an anticoagulant until the patient was discharged to the rehabilitation clinic. A Jewett hyperextension orthosis was fitted and the patients were instructed to wear the brace at all times for 3 months. Patients were advised not to engage in heavy work and sports for 3 months.</P>

<P>
<B>Inclusion criteria:</B> All of the following, an isolated burst fracture within the thoracolumbar region demonstrated on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs; a computed tomography scan revealing a burst-type fracture with retropulsion of vertebral body bone posteriorly into the spinal canal; no new neurological abnormality of the lower extremities or abnormality of bowel or bladder function; presentation less than 3 weeks after the time of the injury; aged between 18 and 66 years; no medical illnesses that would preclude an surgical intervention; no ongoing cancer, infection, bleeding disorder, or skin disease; an understanding of the English language. Concomitant stable compression fractures elsewhere in the spine were permitted if they did not require specific treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B> a closed-head injury (a score of &lt;14 points on the Glasgow coma scale on admission); an open vertebral fracture; a neurological deficit related to the fracture; a loss of structural integrity within the posterior osteo-ligamentous complex (such as facet fracture-dislocation or flexion-distraction ligament disruption); a senile, osteopenic, or insufficiency fracture. A laminar fracture was neither an exclusion criterion nor a contraindication for non-surgical treatment. No absolute degree of kyphosis, canal encroachment by bone, or anterior loss of height was a criterion for exclusion.</P>
