<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-10 09:32:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication that has been studied in anxiety disorders. This review shows that hydroxyzine is better than placebo in terms of anxiety symptoms in individuals with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Too few data were available to be able to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and tolerability of hydroxyzine compared with benzodiazepines and buspirone. Given the robust evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants for GAD, these findings suggest that hydroxyzine should not be recommended as first-line treatment GAD.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:22:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD.<BR/>2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent.<BR/>3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-11-10 10:39:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:18:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:19:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-10 15:36:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:20:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-10 09:32:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common psychiatric disorder, particularly in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1988</LINK>); its point prevalence has been estimated at 1.6% of the population and at 3.1% in a 12-month period (<LINK REF="REF-Wittchen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittchen 1994</LINK>). The prevalence may be underestimated in these figures, as the disorder is often unrecognised (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1988</LINK>). It is characterised by persistent anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and are associated with somatic symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, and psychological symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and irritability (<LINK REF="REF-Weisberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberg 2009</LINK>). GAD has a tendency to occur with other comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, which complicates diagnosis and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1998</LINK>). The most common comorbid conditions seem to be social phobia, simple phobia, panic disorder and major depression (<LINK REF="REF-Brawman_x002d_Mintzer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brawman-Mintzer 1993</LINK>). The nature and course of GAD is chronic (<LINK REF="REF-Caycedo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caycedo 2001</LINK>). There is still some uncertainty about its nosological status, as well as debate about the diagnostic criteria and the relationship between GAD and major depression (<LINK REF="REF-Weisberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberg 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment options for GAD</HEADING>
<P>Both non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (<LINK REF="REF-Hoyer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoyer 2009</LINK>) and pharmacological agents have been researched for the treatment of GAD (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2009</LINK>). Benzodiazepines (BDZ) have been extensively investigated in GAD (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2009</LINK>). They are relatively safe and have a short onset of action (<LINK REF="REF-Cloos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloos 2009</LINK>). In spite of their success, BDZ have several problems which limit their widespread applicability. First of all, there is a high potential for dependence, and because of this treatment should be time limited (<LINK REF="REF-Cloos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloos 2009</LINK>). This may represent a problem in clinical practice, given the chronic nature of GAD. Tolerance can be another factor influencing therapy, especially in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Cloos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloos 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other compounds have been studied for treating GAD which could overcome the problems of BDZ. Buspirone, an azapirone and 5-HT1A partial agonist, has been shown to be as effective as BDZ (<LINK REF="REF-Chessick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chessick 2006</LINK>). Its onset of action is long (2-3 weeks); it has low potential for dependence and is relatively safe in overdose (<LINK REF="REF-Chessick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chessick 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antidepressants have been extensively researched and today are considered the first-line treatment for GAD (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2009</LINK>). The antidepressants tested in GAD employ different mechanisms of actions, mainly acting on serotonin (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs), on serotonin and noradrenaline (selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors - SNRI), or by inhibiting mono-amino-oxidase (MAOI). Other antidepressants are also used in anxiety, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), which are not selective for serotonin or noradrenaline. Antidepressants seem to be effective in reducing the symptoms of GAD in the medium to long term (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2009</LINK>). However, their onset of action is about 4-6 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Kapczinski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapczinski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2005</LINK>) and adverse reactions, including the risk of withdrawal symptoms, may occur during or after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of GAD can be difficult and challenging in both adult and elderly populations. For adults, data show that GAD persists for longer than five years in 40% of individuals with such diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Weisberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberg 2009</LINK>). In older adults, GAD is a common but underestimated, under treated, and poorly studied problem (<LINK REF="REF-Alwahabbi--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwahabbi 2003</LINK>). There is significant evidence suggesting that GAD in older adults has potential for negative consequences, independent of the common comorbidity with major depressive disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Alwahabbi--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alwahabbi 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hydroxyzine and GAD</HEADING>
<P>Hydroxyzine is a histamine receptor (H1) antagonist that was synthesised in Belgium and put on the market in 1955 (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreri 1998</LINK>). It has been widely used in dermatology, for pruritus and urticaria, and can be used as anti-emetic and anti-cholinergic medication (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreri 1998</LINK>). In psychiatric disorders, the efficacy of hydroxyzine was evaluated during the 1960s and 1970s in people with anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Barranco-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barranco 1977</LINK>) and associated comorbid coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulous-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulous 1990</LINK>) or other medical disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Shalowitz-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shalowitz 1961</LINK>). Clinical studies suggested absence of dependence potential and/or drug abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Shalowitz-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shalowitz 1961</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-20 22:12:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hydroxyzine is a medication with anti-histamine activity, acting as an antagonist to H1 receptors with some lesser activity at muscarinic receptors and 5-HT2 serotoninergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Kubo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubo 1987</LINK>). Its anxiolytic activity can be related to suppression of certain subcortical regions (<LINK REF="REF-Barranco-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barranco 1977</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-09-29 21:36:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the 1980s and 1990s there was a revival of interest towards hydroxyzine (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreri 1998</LINK>), after some randomised studies showed a favourable efficacy and safety profile. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has ever been specifically conducted on hydroxyzine in GAD. The aim of this systematic review is to assess efficacy and tolerability of hydroxyzine in GAD.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 25,500 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details.</P>
<P>Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO; quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. <BR/>Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organisation&#8217;s trials portal (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</A>), drug companies, the hand-searching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous, or event-like data, we calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary analysis used a random-effects model OR. We routinely examined the robustness of this summary measure by checking the fixed-effect model OR and the random-effects model OR. When interpreting results, random-effects modelling presents statistical difficulties for examples with small numbers of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2009</LINK>).  We reported material differences between the models.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) (with 95% CI) or standardised mean differences (SMD) (where different measurement scales are used) if the rating scale scores using the random-effects model. We routinely did fixed-effect analyses for the continuous outcomes as well, to investigate the effect of the choice of method on the estimates. We reported material differences between the models.</P>
<P>We presented skewed data and non-quantitative data narratively. We considered an outcome skewed when the mean was smaller than twice the standard deviation.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-11-03 16:44:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When dichotomous outcomes were not reported but baseline mean and endpoint mean and standard deviation (SD) of the HAM-A (or any other anxiety scale) were provided, we calculated the number of responding and remitted participants according to the validated imputation method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>). We examined the validity of this imputation in the sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>Where standard deviations were not recorded, we asked authors to supply the data. When only the standard error (SE) or t-statistics or P values were reported, we calculated SDs according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>. In the absence of data from the trial authors, we used the mean standard deviations from other included studies according to <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>Where participants had withdrawn from the trial before the endpoint, we assumed they would have experienced the negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). When there were missing data and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) has been used to do an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, then we have used the LOCF data, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced.</P>

<P>The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. We could not compare hydroxyzine to SSRI and to other antidepressants, as there were no RCTs available.

Data on remission are not available. Some statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability were found and details are listed below.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:38:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hydroxyzine appears to be more effective than placebo and of comparable efficacy versus active medication. However, no definite conclusion can be made on the efficacy of hydroxyzine in GAD, because the number of studies included is too small and the methodological quality of many of the studies is too low. It is indeed possible that the absence of difference between hydroxyzine and active comparator can be affected by a Type II error. Most of the studies, particularly the older ones, may not be sufficiently powered to detect a difference.</P>
<P>If compared to placebo, hydroxyzine appears to be more efficacious. It is unclear whether this can be the result of a direct anti-anxiety effect or of a sedative effect. Drowsiness was, in fact, statistically significant compared to placebo. Hydroxyzine seems to be well tolerated when compared to active medication, although this result can be affected by bias.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:39:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limited number of trials included in this review make findings difficult to apply without careful consideration. It appears that hydroxyzine has no difference in terms of efficacy if compared to benzodiazepines, and has a comparable side effect profile. An important factor is related to the clinical population included in the studies. The older studies included a population where no standardised diagnostic criteria were used. On the other hand, the newer studies showed a higher quality but included a population with "pure" GAD. It is well known that GAD carries a significant psychiatric comorbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Griez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griez 2001</LINK>) which can make this disorder more difficult to treat. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the findings of the newer studies to a real population. Moreover, some analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity. The reasons for that are mainly due to the difference in methodological standards between newer studies and older studies. Also, medication compared to hydroxyzine does not include antidepressants (SSRI in particular), which limits the applicability of the findings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:40:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the trials included were adequately reported for all items. Many items are recorded as not clear and thus assessment of risk of bias was difficult. The risk of bias is quite high, particularly for the older studies. These studies show that hydroxyzine is an efficacious medication, but the risk of bias is so high that it is not possible to extrapolate any meaningful clinical conclusion on the real efficacy or tolerability of hydroxyzine. This review has several limitations: first, the number of studies included is quite small with a low number of participants included. The quality of studies is another important limiting issue: half of the studies were old and used non-standardised criteria; old studies often yield incomplete data and these were, in general, of poor quality.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A potential source bias can be the completeness of the selected studies. Whilst every effort has been made to search all the studies on hydroxyzine in GAD, it may be possible that some studies could have been missed, particularly older ones. Some of the most recent studies were also sponsored by the pharmaceutical company manufacturing hydroxyzine, which can be another source of bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:42:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis specifically focused on hydroxyzine. There has been a systematic review carried out by Ferreri et al (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreri 1998</LINK>), on recent trials of hydroxyzine in GAD. They also included open studies or non-randomised trials. They concluded that hydroxyzine can be efficacious over placebo and could show greater improvement on cognitive symptoms than lorazepam. In this review, the authors recommend that more clinical studies on hydroxyzine should be carried out, particularly on GAD with comorbid depression, different subtypes of anxiety and in chronic GAD for long-term treatment. They do not mention the necessity to compare hydroxyzine with SSRIs in GAD; this is probably because the article was written in a time where SSRIs were not extensively used in GAD. Another promising result comes from a recent study that shows the potential for hydroxyzine to be a first-line treatment for GAD: in fact, <LINK REF="REF-Hidalgo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hidalgo 2007</LINK> showed that hydroxyzine, along with pregabalin, had the highest effect size in GAD among other anxiolytics such as SSRIs, venlafaxine, buspirone and benzodiazepines, compared to placebo. Although this is only an indirect comparison between hydroxyzine and antidepressants, data show that hydroxyzine might have its space in treatment of GAD in the future if further high-quality studies are carried out.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:43:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:42:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given this data, and adding the risk of bias from the included studies, we do not have enough data to recommend hydroxyzine as first-line treatment for people suffering from GAD. Due to the low quality of the studies examined, it is not possible also to draw any conclusion on the efficacy and tolerability profile of hydroxyzine versus the active comparator in GAD. Moreover, nowadays new generations of psychiatrists tend to be less familiar with older medications and this may contribute to make the prescription of hydroxyzine quite uncommon in GAD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-03 17:43:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the quality of the studies is low, it is important to design good-quality trials comparing hydroxyzine with antidepressants, in particular with SSRIs. Unfortunately, there is no study comparing hydroxyzine to antidepressants, which are now the first line treatment for anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2008</LINK>). Since antidepressants are the cornerstone of GAD treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2008</LINK>), hydroxyzine has to be compared to this category in order to be tested in efficacy and tolerability. Moreover, a longer duration of trials is needed in future studies. GAD is a chronic and long-lasting disorder; the studies included in this review do not have an observation period longer than 12 weeks. It is necessary to study hydroxyzine compared to other agents in the long term. Trials should include an observation period of at least 24 weeks, in order to assess the feasibility of hydroxyzine in GAD in the long term.</P>
