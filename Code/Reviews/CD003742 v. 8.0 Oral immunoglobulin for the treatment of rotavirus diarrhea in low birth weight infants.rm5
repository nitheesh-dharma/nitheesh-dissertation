<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:42:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rotavirus infection can cause significant problems including diarrhea in the newborn. This is particularly true in babies weighing less than 2500 g (low birth weight infants). Rotavirus infection is becoming more common in newborn babies and can spread from one baby to another in the neonatal unit. Administration of antibodies against rotavirus to babies may be one of the methods to treat this infection and to prevent the spread of infection in the neonatal unit. In this review, we did not identify any trial that used antibodies to treat rotavirus infection. More research is needed to address these issues.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:43:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Rotavirus infection is the most common neonatal nosocomial viral infection. It is a major health problem worldwide. Epidemics with the newer P(6)G9 strains have been reported in neonatal units globally. These strains can cause severe symptoms in most infected infants. Infection control measures become necessary and the utilization of hospital resources increase. Local mucosal immunity in the intestine to rotavirus is important in the resolution of infection and protection against subsequent infections. Boosting local immunity by oral administration of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulin preparations might be a useful strategy in treating rotaviral infections, especially in low birth weight babies. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:43:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Group A rotavirus infection is a major cause of diarrheal morbidity in children. Globally, it is estimated that in children &lt; 5 years of age, rotavirus causes 111 million episodes of gastroenteritis requiring only home care, 25 million clinic visits, two million hospitalizations and 440,000 deaths. 82% of deaths occurred in the poorest countries (<LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2003</LINK>). It has been recognized as the most common neonatal nosocomial viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Strodtbeck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strodtbeck 1986</LINK>). Several outbreaks of rotaviral infection in neonatal nurseries in different countries have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bryden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryden 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shif-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shif 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omoigberale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omoigberale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akinci-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinci 1991</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Rotavirus infection epidemics appear to be seasonal, being more common in the colder winter months. Infection rates range from 13% to 78% of neonates in the neonatal unit during epidemics (<LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tufvesson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tufvesson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilgore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilgore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicirello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicirello 1994</LINK>). The main reservoir of rotavirus infection in neonatal nurseries seems to be the infected neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Grillner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grillner 1985</LINK>) and most infection occurs in the first few days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kilgore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilgore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicirello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicirello 1994</LINK>). Cohorting healthy newborns in nurseries is no longer standard practice and hence this is not a problem in term newborns. However, survival rates have improved over the last decade for very low birth weight and extremely premature infants who stay longer in neonatal units. Premature and low birth weight infants and infants staying in the neonatal unit longer have shown to have a greater risk of acquiring rotavirus infection (<LINK REF="REF-Dennehy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennehy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walther-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walther 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dearlove-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dearlove 1983</LINK>). Rotavirus, especially the newer strains, can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration in already sick neonates. Rotavirus infection has been shown to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants during an outbreak in a neonatal unit (<LINK REF="REF-Mogilner-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogilner 1983</LINK>). In another study, 29% of neonates with NEC were stool rotavirus positive. Although these infants had lower Bell's Staging of NEC, the outcome of these infants regarding mortality or complication rates did not differ from rotavirus negative infants who had NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2004</LINK>). A significantly higher incidence of bradycardia-apnoea episodes (BAE) has been noticed two days before and two days after the diagnosis of rotavirus infection in infants. These episodes were followed by cyanosis and required intervention more often than did BAE episodes in rotavirus negative infants (<LINK REF="REF-Riedel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedel 1996</LINK>). Rotavirus infected neonates stay in the hospital longer than non-infected neonates, causing increased stress to the family and increased cost to the neonatal unit (<LINK REF="REF-Strodtbeck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strodtbeck 1986</LINK>). Strict infection control measures have been advocated including hand protection, hand disinfection, individual nursing sets, and cohorting infected babies (<LINK REF="REF-Grehn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grehn 1990</LINK>). Closure of neonatal units (<LINK REF="REF-Valmari-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valmari 1984</LINK>) has been recommended to control and eradicate outbreaks of nosocomial rotavirus infections, placing considerable stress on busy neonatal units.</P>
<P>Newer strains of rotavirus P(6)G9 genotypes that previously have not been known to cause outbreaks of diarrhea have been identified to cause epidemics in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Cubitt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cubitt 2000</LINK>), US (<LINK REF="REF-Ramachandran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramachandran 1999</LINK>), Bangladesh (<LINK REF="REF-Unicomb-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unicomb 1999</LINK>) and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2002</LINK>). Unlike previous strains, the new P(6)G9 strains can cause serious outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal units and cause severe symptoms in most infected neonates. Most mothers have not been exposed to these new strains and thus a high proportion of neonates lack protective antibodies, which could explain high attack rates in the neonatal unit and the severity of symptoms. Predominance of neonatal cases compared to few cases in older children may indicate that neonates have an increased risk of infection by P(6)G9 strains.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:11:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Determinants of protective immunity against rotavirus are unclear but it has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Molyneaux-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneaux 1995</LINK>) that local mucosal immunity in the intestine may protect against rotavirus illness. While local antibodies may be important in the resolution of infection and protection from subsequent infections, there is no specific antibody that could be used reliably as a marker of protection (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1996</LINK>). Breast-fed infants are less susceptible to rotavirus infection, probably due to the presence of anti-rotaviral secretory IgA and trypsin inhibitors in the breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jayashree-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayashree 1988</LINK>). The protective efficacy of breast milk correlates positively with the concentrations of anti-rotaviral secretory IgA in the breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Jayashree-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayashree 1988</LINK>). Breast-fed infants tend to excrete fewer viruses than bottle-fed infants after infection with rotavirus (<LINK REF="REF-Chrystie-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrystie 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral administration of immunoglobulin containing preparations of bovine colostrum from immunized cows, egg yolk immunoglobulin from immunized hens (<LINK REF="REF-Mine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 2002</LINK>) or pooled plasma derived immunoglobulins can provide passive immunity. The highest titers of neutralizing anti-rotaviral antibodies are in bovine colostrum, then in egg yolk followed by human pooled plasma derived immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="REF-Bogstedt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogstedt 1996</LINK>). These preparations may inhibit intestinal viral adherence or viral replication and may have a role in the treatment of rotavirus infections. Oral immunoglobulin preparations are resistant to proteolytic digestion and retain significant neutralizing activity in the stools of treated infants .The newborn infant's immaturity of proteolytic enzymes or rapid gastro-intestinal transit time permits intact or nearly intact IgG to pass throughout the gastrointestinal system (<LINK REF="REF-Hilpert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilpert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blum-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 1981</LINK>). In a prospective randomised placebo controlled study of oral human serum immunoglobulin in children (but not neonates) with acute rotaviral gastroenteritis, there was a reduction in total duration of viral diarrhea, and viral excretion, and a faster clinical improvement compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Guarino-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 1994</LINK>). Bovine colostrum from hyperimmunized pregnant cows has been shown to reduce viral excretion, stool output and the need for rehydration when used in the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis in children other than neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Hilpert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilpert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitra-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 1995</LINK>). It has also been shown to prevent diarrhea from rotavirus infection when used as prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Ebina-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebina 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1993</LINK>). Antibodies derived from the yolk of rotavirus immunized hens have been tested in acute rotaviral gastroenteritis in children beyond the neonatal period in a randomized placebo controlled trial, and found to cause earlier clearance of virus from the stools and an improvement of diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Sarker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sarker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:43:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advantages of administering oral immunoglobulin-containing preparations in neonates, especially low birth weight infants, would be a reduction in morbidity, reduction in the need for rehydration, earlier clearance of the virus thereby reducing the duration of infection control measures, and a reduction in hospital stay. Infection control measures are expensive and sometimes involve closure of infected units; oral immunoglobulins could be a cheaper and an easier alternative.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:46:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. </P>
<P>If eligible studies were found, we planned to independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We planned on using the following methodological criteria: </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we planned to describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); unclear risk. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we planned to describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, of changed after assignment. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); unclear risk. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? For each included study, we planned to assess the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>
<P>a. low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for participants;</P>
<P>b. low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</P>
<P>c. low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to address whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We planned to assess the methods as: low risk; high risk; unclear risk.</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study we planned to describe how we examined the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we planned to describe any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias. We planned to assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: low risk; high risk; unclear risk.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lodinova-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lodinova 1984</LINK>
<BR/>The first author confirmed that this study appeared as three reports (see References to studies, excluded studies). Fifty-six infants (preterm and term) admitted with diarrhea were administered colostrum from cows immunised against 6 serotypes of E.Coli. They were compared with 29 infants (preterm and term) admitted with diarrhea who were administered the standard treatment (no intervention). Outcomes reported were i) cure of diarrhea (not defined) ii) need for oral antibiotics iii) need for parenteral rehydration iv) weight gain v) number of stools vi) quality of stools vii) bacterial pathogens before and after treatment viii) need for parenteral antibiotics ix) additional illnesses. This study was excluded because it was not a randomized study and rotavirus diarrhea was not an eligibility criterion for this study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1982</LINK>
<BR/>The participants in this study were 75 infants with birth weights ranging from 2000 to 2500 g, who were admitted to the special care baby unit, where rotavirus infection was known to be endemic. Rotavirus infection was not an eligibility criterion nor was diarrhea. Seventy-five infants were randomized to receive either oral gammaglobulin or placebo within 12 hours of birth. A subset of 25 infants who excreted rotavirus sometime in the first two weeks of life were analyzed in the study report for the following outcomes: timing of excretion of rotavirus, grading of severity of rotavirus excretion, duration of excretion of rotavirus and the incidence of clinically important diarrhea requiring low lactose feeds. Fifty out of 75 infants who did not excrete rotavirus were excluded from the analysis in the study report. This study was excluded because rotavirus diarrhea in the participants was not an entry criterion.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ventura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ventura 1993</LINK>
<BR/>Fifty-four infants (aged 1 to 36 months) admitted with acute diarrhea were randomized to oral gammaglobulin (24 infants) or placebo (30 infants). Outcomes reported were duration of diarrhea and duration of excretion of rotavirus in the two groups. Age and birth weight details are not available and, therefore, the study was excluded.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:43:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rotavirus infection is a major global problem and affects infants in both the developing and the developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bern-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bern 1992</LINK>). It accounts for a significant amount of diarrheal morbidity and mortality in children less than five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2003</LINK>
<B>)</B>. Newer strains of rotavirus [P(6)G9] cause significant morbidity in infected neonates especially low birth weight and or premature neonates. It has the potential to resurface as a major problem in low birth infants admitted to the neonatal units who are at risk of significant morbidity. Infection control measures become imperative in affected neonatal units and place a considerable burden on health resources. This could mean closure or restriction of available neonatal cots or services and more health costs. Therefore, effective treatment of rotavirus infected neonates with diarrhea assumes great clinical importance, more so in developing countries.</P>
<P>Active immunization with rotavirus vaccines can be an effective strategy to prevent rotavirus infections. The initial vaccine licensed was a tetravalent rhesus-human reassortment vaccine (Rotashield). Vaccination with this vaccine was discontinued because of safety concerns, as there was an association with intussuception. Currently available vaccines RotaTeq and RIX4414 (Rotarix) have not been shown to be associated with intussuception and have shown about 70% efficacy against any rotavirus disease and 90-100% efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus disease (<LINK REF="REF-Vesikari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesikari 2006</LINK>). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine vaccination against rotavirus with either the pentavalent human-bovine reassortment rotavirus vaccine (RV5) or the live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine (RV1) to be given orally for three or two doses respectively starting from 6 weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2009</LINK>). However, current rotavirus vaccines do not include the newer P(6)G9 rotavirus strains,and hence vaccination would not be expected to prevent neonatal rotavirus infection in hospitalized low birth weight infants.</P>
<P>Newer preparations of oral anti-rotaviral immunoglobulins namely cow's colostrum and egg yolk immunoglobulins (<LINK REF="REF-Mine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 2002</LINK>), which have a high titer of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulins have become available and have already shown to be beneficial in older children. Further evaluation of these oral immunoglobulin preparations in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in low birth weight and or premature infants is therefore indicated.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:43:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rotavirus diarrhea remains a major problem in the developing world and could resurface as a significant problem in the developed world. There has been an emergence of newer strains of rotavirus, which cause a more severe clinical disease in infected neonates. Availability of high titre anti-rotaviral immunoglobulin preparations should encourage researchers to undertake well designed, large RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these preparations in rotavirus infected infants, especially in low birth weight or premature infants. Low birth weight and/or premature infants are likely to have a higher mortality and morbidity after infections with newer strains of rotavirus and it will be prudent to test in this category of infants. Trialists should also be encouraged to address the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in low birth weight infants cared for at home in the developing world, who are at significant risk of morbidity and even death. Randomized controlled trials for treatment of rotavirus infection should use rapid diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lipson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipson 2001</LINK>) to ascertain rotavirus infection as an eligibility criterion, in order to avoid confusion with other gastro-intestinal infections in low birth weight infants. Such randomized controlled trials should assess effects on a combination of outcomes, which include mortality, morbidity and health resource utilisation. Key outcomes would be a reduction in morbidity in this high risk group of infants, as well as duration of viral excretion, which will determine the duration of expensive infection control measures. The design of these RCTs should also include cost-effectiveness evaluations.</P>
