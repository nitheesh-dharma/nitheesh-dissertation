<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:46:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The World Health Organization defines chronic conditions as "health problems that require ongoing management over a period of years or decades". Many people with a chronic health problem or condition, have more than one chronic health condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity. This generally means that people could have any possible combination of health conditions but in some studies the combinations of conditions are pre-specified to target common combinations such as diabetes and heart disease. We refer to these types of studies as comorbidity studies. Little is known about the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review aimed to identify and summarise the existing evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinical and mental health outcomes and patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life for people with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to September 2015 and identified 18 generally well-designed randomised controlled trials meeting the eligibility criteria. Nine of these studies focused on specific combinations of health conditions (comorbidity studies), for example diabetes and heart disease. The other nine studies included people with a broad range of conditions (multimorbidity studies) although they tended to focus on elderly people. The majority of studies examined interventions that involved changes to the organisation of care delivery although some studies had more patient-focused interventions. All studies had governmental or charitable sources of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Overall the results regarding the effectiveness of interventions were mixed. There were no clear positive improvements in clinical outcomes, health service use, medication adherence, patient-related health behaviours, health professional behaviours or costs. There were modest improvements in mental health outcomes from seven studies that targeted people with depression, and in functional outcomes from two studies targeting functional difficulties in participants. Overall the results indicate that it is difficult to improve outcomes for people with multiple conditions. The review suggests that interventions that are designed to target specific risk factors (for example treatment for depression) or interventions that focus on difficulties that people experience with daily functioning (for example, physiotherapy treatment to improve capacity for physical activity) may be more effective. There is a need for further studies on this topic, particularly involving people with multimorbidity in general across the age ranges.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality/certainty of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All of the included studies were randomised controlled trials. The overall quality of these studies was good though many studies did not fully report on all potential sources of bias. As definitions of multimorbidity vary among studies, the potential to reasonably combine study results and draw overall conclusions is limited. Overall, we judged that the certainty or confidence we can have in the results from this review is moderate but due to small numbers of studies and mixed results we acknowledge the uncertainty remaining and the potential that future studies could change our conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-15 15:10:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people with chronic disease have more than one chronic condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity. The term comorbidity is also used but this is now taken to mean that there is a defined index condition with other linked conditions, for example diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is also used when there are combinations of defined conditions that commonly co-exist, for example diabetes and depression. While this is not a new phenomenon, there is greater recognition of its impact and the importance of improving outcomes for individuals affected. Research in the area to date has focused mainly on descriptive epidemiology and impact assessment. There has been limited exploration of the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:38:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of health-service or patient-oriented interventions designed to improve outcomes in people with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings. Multimorbidity was defined as two or more chronic conditions in the same individual.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 16:51:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and seven other databases to 28 September 2015. We also searched grey literature and consulted experts in the field for completed or ongoing studies.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-22 15:08:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised clinical trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings. Multimorbidity was defined as two or more chronic conditions in the same individual. This includes studies where participants can have combinations of any condition or have combinations of pre-specified common conditions (comorbidity), for example, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The comparison was usual care as delivered in that setting.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-15 13:48:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies, evaluated study quality, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta-analysis of the results where possible and carried out a narrative synthesis for the remainder of the results. We present the results in a 'Summary of findings' table and tabular format to show effect sizes across all outcome types.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-22 15:06:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>We identified 18 RCTs examining a range of complex interventions for people with multimorbidity. Nine studies focused on defined comorbid conditions with an emphasis on depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The remaining studies focused on multimorbidity, generally in older people. In 12 studies, the predominant intervention element was a change to the organisation of care delivery, usually through case management or enhanced multidisciplinary team work. In six studies, the interventions were predominantly patient-oriented, for example, educational or self-management support-type interventions delivered directly to participants. Overall our confidence in the results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from low to high certainty. There was little or no difference in clinical outcomes (based on moderate certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved (based on high certainty evidence) and there were modest reductions in mean depression scores for the comorbidity studies that targeted participants with depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) &#8722;2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) &#8722;2.52 to &#8722;1.95). There was probably a small improvement in patient-reported outcomes (moderate certainty evidence) although two studies that specifically targeted functional difficulties in participants had positive effects on functional outcomes with one of these studies also reporting a reduction in mortality at four year follow-up (Int 6%, Con 13%, absolute difference 7%). The intervention may make little or no difference to health service use (low certainty evidence), may slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty evidence), probably slightly improves patient-related health behaviours (moderate certainty evidence), and probably improves provider behaviour in terms of prescribing behaviour and quality of care (moderate certainty evidence). Cost data were limited.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:43:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identifies the emerging evidence to support policy for the management of people with multimorbidity and common comorbidities in primary care and community settings. There are remaining uncertainties about the effectiveness of interventions for people with multimorbidity in general due to the relatively small number of RCTs conducted in this area to date, with mixed findings overall. It is possible that the findings may change with the inclusion of large ongoing well-organised trials in future updates. The results suggest an improvement in health outcomes if interventions can be targeted at risk factors such as depression, or specific functional difficulties in people with multimorbidity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-25 16:15:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Many people with chronic disease have more than one chronic condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity. While this is not a new phenomenon, there is greater recognition of its impact and the importance of improving outcomes for individuals affected. Research in the area to date has focused mainly on descriptive epidemiology and impact assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2007</LINK>). There has been limited exploration of the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity.<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-22 07:36:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There has been increasing focus on the enormous personal and societal burden of ill-health caused by chronic disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the importance of organising healthcare delivery systems to improve health outcomes and has stressed the importance of building integrated healthcare systems that can address chronic disease management (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). This can be done by focusing on generic chronic care models, as has happened mainly in the United States of America (USA), or by developing national systems focusing on single chronic conditions as has happened with the National Service Frameworks in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satariano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 2013</LINK>). However, many people with chronic disease have more than one chronic condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity and formally defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2005</LINK>). While this is not a new phenomenon, there is greater recognition of its impact and the importance of improving outcomes for individuals affected (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the accepted term for people with multiple chronic conditions is now multimorbidity, the term comorbidity has been used interchangeably in the past. It is now accepted that comorbidity should be used when there is a specified index condition or where there are defined combinations of conditions (for example hypertension and cardiovascular disease) as opposed to multimorbidity where any condition could be included (<LINK REF="REF-Valderas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valderas 2011</LINK>). Multimorbidity is the more general term and individuals with comorbidity also have multimorbidity but the reverse does not necessarily apply. For the purposes of this review when analysing the included studies, we looked at studies based on the intervention elements but we also considered differences between studies that specifically target comorbid conditions as opposed to those targeting general multimorbidity. This is because interventions in the comorbidity studies are designed to target the specific included conditions. These distinctions are important in the context of developing and evaluating effective interventions and considering their generalisability (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Individuals with multimorbidity are more likely to die prematurely (<LINK REF="REF-Deeg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menotti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menotti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rochon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochon 1996</LINK>), be admitted to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_hler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bähler 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Condelius-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condelius 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2013</LINK>), and have longer hospital stays (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_hler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bähler 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Librero-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Librero 1999</LINK>). They have poorer quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Brettschneider-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brettschneider 2013</LINK>), loss of physical functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Bayliss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayliss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2006b</LINK>), and are more likely to suffer from psychological stress (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2012</LINK>). Medicines management is often complex, resulting in polypharmacy with its attendant risks of drug interactions and adverse drug events (<LINK REF="REF-Duerden-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duerden 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gandhi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandhi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 2011</LINK>). For patients, in addition to understanding and managing their conditions and drug regimes, they must also attend multiple appointments with different healthcare providers and adhere to lifestyle recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Gallacher-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallacher 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence studies of multimorbidity have been carried out in different countries indicating that, particularly in those over 60 years, the majority of people attending family primary care services had more than one chronic condition (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2006c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Akker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Akker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2002</LINK>). A subgroup of these service users have a debilitating combination of conditions that have a high impact on their own lives but also on their utilisation of health services and related costs (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marengoni-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marengoni 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parmelee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmelee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>). This emerging concept may be referred to as 'complex multimorbidity' and has been defined as people with three or more chronic conditions involving three or more body systems (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2014</LINK>). These individuals can pose management difficulties, resulting in frequent health care visits, frequent emergency hospital admissions, and repeated investigations with enormous cost both for the individuals and the healthcare system involved. A UK report has examined the costs associated with this group of people who are described as 'high impact users' on the basis of their frequent emergency admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Rowell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowell 2006</LINK>). Fragmentation of care is a significant problem for this group, resulting from the involvement of both primary care and multiple specialists who may not be communicating with each other effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2015</LINK>). Starfield found that people with a greater morbidity burden have a higher use of specialists even for conditions that are normally managed in primary care, and concludes that there is a need for a better understanding of the roles of generalists and specialists in managing these individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Starfield-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starfield 2005</LINK>)</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:53:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the complexity of managing people with multiple chronic conditions, potential interventions are likely to be complex and multifaceted if they are to address the varied needs of these individuals. We anticipated that a variety of intervention types could work to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity and could be included within the scope of this review. Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) has developed a taxonomy that defines intervention types (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>). We have used this taxonomy to define health service and patient-oriented interventions that have been designed to improve outcomes of people or populations with more than one chronic condition.</P>
<P>1. Professional interventions: for example, education designed to change the behaviour of clinicians. Such interventions may work by altering professionals' awareness of multimorbidity or providing training or education designed to equip clinicians with skills in managing these individuals, thus improving their healthcare delivery.</P>
<P>2. Financial interventions: for example, financial incentives to providers to reach treatment targets. These interventions might work by incentivising health service delivery and providing resources to extend consultation length for people with multimorbidity.</P>
<P>3. Organisational interventions: these can be further divided into organisational changes delivered through practitioners or directly to patients. For example, any changes to care delivery such as case management or the addition of different healthcare workers such as a pharmacist to the healthcare team. These interventions may work by changing care delivery to match the needs of people with multimorbidity across a range of areas such as coordination of care, medicines management, or use of other health professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists to address needs relating to physical and social functioning.</P>
<P>4. Patient-oriented interventions: this would include any intervention directed primarily at individuals, for example, education or support for self management. These interventions might work by improving self management, thus enabling people to manage their conditions more effectively and to seek appropriate health care.</P>
<P>5. Regulatory interventions: for example, changes to local or national regulations designed to alter care delivery in order to improve outcomes. Such interventions might work by introducing regulatory changes that facilitate and enable the funding of care that is directed towards those with complex health needs. An example could be the introduction of free primary care for people with multimorbidity on the basis that preventive care might prevent subsequent more costly hospital admissions. While we did not find these types of interventions, we believe they could exist and would fall within the scope of this review for future updates.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 16:15:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>We anticipated that organisational-type interventions might predominate. We were aware that there has been a focus on case management, based mainly in health maintenance organisations in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>). Case management is defined as the explicit allocation of co-ordination of tasks to an appointed individual or group and it is postulated that the function of co-ordination is so important and specialised that responsibility for carrying it out needs to be explicitly allocated (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>). Our review included studies where case management was employed but only if it was specifically directed towards individuals identified as having multimorbidity.</P>
<P>The implementation of the Family Medicine Groups in the province of Québec, Canada, is another example of an organisational intervention as it involved new forms of shared responsibilities between physicians and nurses (<LINK REF="REF-MSSS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MSSS 2001</LINK>). Another example in the United Kingdom (UK) is the community matrons programme, which is being delivered through primary care trusts and is based on nurse-provided case management for people with complex care needs including those with multimorbidity (<LINK REF="REF-London-DOH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">London DOH 2005</LINK>). It is similar to previous programmes delivered through social services in the 1990s and there have been concerns expressed as to the feasibility of achieving the programme targets without real integration of primary and specialist services (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The differences outlined earlier between multimorbidity in general and comorbidity where there are defined combinations of conditions also influences how interventions are designed. Interventions targeting specified comorbid conditions can be designed to address the specific challenges for people with those conditions. For example, an intervention that targets people with diabetes and depression will combine elements of diabetes-focused care with psychotherapy or escalation of antidepressant medication, or both interventions, so as to address both conditions. Interventions for people with multimorbidity in general cannot have a disease focus as there are no pre-specified conditions so the interventions might address improved coordination of care, improved medicines management or specific functional difficulties experienced by patients.</P>
<P>Since this review was originally planned in 2007, there has been widespread recognition of the need to address the challenge of multimorbidity across health systems with a series of articles in international medical journals highlighting the challenges involved. Two very useful resources highlighting the challenges of multimorbidity and collating research in the area are: i) the BMJ multimorbidity special collections (<LINK REF="REF-BMJ-Multimorbidity-collection" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMJ Multimorbidity collection</LINK>) and ii) the International Research Community on Multimorbidity archive IRCMO at the University of Sherbrooke, Quèbec, Canada (<LINK REF="REF-IRCMO" TYPE="REFERENCE">IRCMO</LINK>). The BMJ series includes a series of editorials, original research studies and a clinical review with a multimorbidity focus. IRCMO provides a platform for any researcher interested in multimorbidity to contribute to a regularly updated blog and also compiles a list of multimorbidity related publications.</P>

<P>This review was originally undertaken based on the clear recognition of the need for integrated care for people with multiple conditions who have complex care needs (<LINK REF="REF-Stange-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stange 2005</LINK>). The evidence base for managing chronic conditions is based largely on trials of interventions for single conditions and individuals with multimorbidity are often excluded from such studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2006c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Starfield-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starfield 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2014</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Zulman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zulman 2011</LINK>). The inadequacy of existing clinical guidelines to support clinicians in managing people with multimorbidity has been highlighted as a significant issue in delivering care (<LINK REF="REF-Dumbreck-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumbreck 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2014</LINK>). Clinical guideline developers have attempted to address this issue with the consideration of certain combinations of commonly co-occurring conditions, for example, diabetes and depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). However good quality evidence is essential to inform this clinical area and in recent years focus has shifted to intervention development and the need to reorientate clinical practice and healthcare systems for the people who use them most (<LINK REF="REF-Satariano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 2013</LINK>).<BR/>

We included NRCTs in the original protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007b</LINK>) as we anticipated that, given the challenges in undertaking multimorbidity research (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2007</LINK>) and the likelihood that complex interventions would be tested, there would be relatively few RCTs and that non-randomised designs might be used instead.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:55:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any people or populations with multimorbidity receiving care in a primary or community care setting. We adopted the most widely used definition of multimorbidity, that is, the co-existence of multiple chronic diseases and medical conditions in the same individual, usually defined as two or more conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Akker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Akker 1998</LINK>). We used the WHO definition of chronic disease, which is "health problems that require ongoing management over a period of years or decades" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). We included all studies that identified participants or sub-groups of participants on the basis of multimorbidity, as defined by the study authors. In some studies, additional eligibility criteria were applied (for example, history of high service utilisation) in an effort to identify more vulnerable people who might benefit more from the intervention being studied.</P>
<P>We excluded studies where multimorbidity was assumed to be the norm on the basis of individuals' age as the interventions were not being targeted specifically at multimorbidity and its recognised challenges. This included studies where interventions were directed at communities of people based on location or age of participants in which participants could be presumed to have multimorbidity on the basis of their age or residence in a nursing home but interventions were not designed to specifically target multimorbidity.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 14:57:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any type of intervention that was specifically directed towards a group of people defined as having multimorbidity. Only interventions based in primary care and community settings were included. Interventions included care delivered by family doctors, nurses, or other primary care professionals. Primary health care was defined as providing "integrated, easy to access, health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained and continuous relationship with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community" (<LINK REF="REF-Vaneslow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaneslow 1995</LINK>). However, not all countries have clearly-defined primary care systems (<LINK REF="REF-Starfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starfield 1998</LINK>), so we included care delivered in community settings by individuals fulfilling the basic criteria for primary care, i.e. if they are available to treat all common conditions in all age groups and have an ongoing relationship with their patients. While some specialists may deliver components of primary care to their patients, practitioners were not included unless they fulfilled the definition of being available to treat all conditions and have an ongoing relationship with their patients.</P>
<P>Interventions were classified as 'simple' if they used one identifiable component or 'multifaceted' if they incorporated more than one feature.</P>
<P>We categorised interventions using the EPOC taxonomy presented in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section. Where interventions had multiple elements, we defined each element within the taxonomy and highlighted the predominant element of the intervention (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<LI>Professional educational interventions or research initiatives where there was no specified structured clinical care delivered to an identified group of people with multimorbidity.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Interventions including people with comorbid conditions where the intervention was targeted solely at one condition and did not address the full extent of the multimorbidity. This commonly arises in relation to chronic disease and comorbid depression, so called 'depression plus one studies'. These are increasingly common as the link between depression and most chronic conditions has now been well established (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2001</LINK>). They include interventions designed to address depression in participants rather than targeting all conditions identified. We therefore excluded such studies if the intervention was only targeted at the depression and did not address the full extent of the multimorbidity.</LI>

<P>We searched the IRCMO repository for unpublished/grey literature (<LINK REF="REF-IRCMO" TYPE="REFERENCE">IRCMO</LINK>), and invited experts to inform us of other completed or ongoing studies</P>
<P>The search strategy was particularly challenging given the lack of a MeSH terms for multimorbidity. In addition, we were aware from existing epidemiological literature that the recognition of multimorbidity as a concept is relatively recent. Multimorbidity is sometimes used synonymously with the term comorbidity, though this tends to be used in relation to diseases that coexist with an index disease under study (<LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2004</LINK>).

Analyses were undertaken for clinical outcomes (glycaemic control and blood pressure) and depression scores in the comorbidity studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Population/participants</HEADING>
<P>There were a total of 8727 participants across all studies. The interventions varied in duration from eight weeks to two years, with the majority lasting 6 to 12 months. There was also variation in post intervention follow-up, varying from immediate follow-up to follow-up 12 months post intervention cessation.</P>
<P>Nine of the 18 studies recruited participants with a broad range of conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eakin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eakin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochhalter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochhalter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2000</LINK>), whereas the remaining nine focused on the following comorbidities: depression and hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>); depression and diabetes and/or heart disease (<LINK REF="STD-Barley-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Barley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>); depression and headache (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK>); diabetes and hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2012</LINK>); and a sub-group of people with at least two of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and irritable bowel syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Settings</HEADING>
<P>All studies were set in primary care or community settings in the USA, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK> which was set in the UK National Health Service and <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK> which was set in Canada. Eight were funded by a government or university grant (<LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK>); and the remaining studies were funded by charitable foundations. None were funded directly by the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison intervention</HEADING>
<P>In the majority of included studies, the comparator was usual medical care which in some studies was supplemented by a newsletter or leaflet (<LINK REF="STD-Eakin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eakin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>), or involved a baseline assessment but no follow-on intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>). These minimal additions to usual care could be considered as being within the variation of usual care provided in different settings. One study invited those allocated to a control group to attend a group session based on an unrelated topic (<LINK REF="STD-Hochhalter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochhalter 2010</LINK>). This was an attempt to ensure that the intervention effect did not relate to the group setting but related to the intervention content.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The interventions were all multifaceted and brief descriptions for each study are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. No study specifically reported consumer involvement in the intervention design.</P>
<P>As outlined in the methods, we used the EPOC taxonomy of interventions to describe and categorise the interventions tested in these studies (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2002</LINK>). While the interventions identified all involved multiple components they could be divided broadly into two main groups. In 12 of 18 studies, the interventions were primarily organisational, for example case management or addition of a pharmacist to the clinical care team (<LINK REF="STD-Barley-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Barley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2012</LINK>). In the remaining six studies, the interventions were primarily patient-oriented, for example self-management support groups (<LINK REF="STD-Eakin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eakin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochhalter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochhalter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2014</LINK>). However, there were overlapping elements with some organisational-type studies including patient-oriented elements such as education provided by a case manager and vice versa. No study involving financial or regulatory type interventions were identified. We have included an additional table which outlines intervention elements and indicates which elements featured in each of the included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>)</P>

<P>We excluded 74 studies in total, see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. Thirty-four studies were excluded on the basis of ineligible participants. In some of these studies there was a potential multimorbidity sub-group but these data were not reported or not available from authors when requested. Twenty-six studies were excluded on the basis of an ineligible intervention. This was usually because it was conducted in a specialist setting or had a single-condition focus despite participants having multiple conditions. The remaining studies were excluded on the basis of study design, largely due to absence of control groups.</P>

Baseline measurement of outcomes was carried out in all studies. All reported adequate follow-up of participants except <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2012</LINK> where the risk of bias was assessed as unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK> did not provide specific details pertaining to follow-up for the multimorbidity subgroup, although follow-up for the overall study was assessed as adequate. There was high risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK> with poorer follow-up in the intervention group (57%) compared to the control group (80%) at study completion. Objective outcomes were used in all but two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>, where this dimension was assessed as unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK> used a measure detailing pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) which was a previously developed classification system modified for the study. <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK> collected data on chronic and preventive care delivery from individuals' records but the accuracy of this process was not described. Blinding of outcome assessment was assessed as done in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochhalter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochhalter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2000</LINK>). It was assessed as unclear in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barley-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Barley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eakin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eakin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2012</LINK>); and assessed as not done in <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>Five of the 18 studies had a cluster design that ensured no contamination of control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2000</LINK>). Contamination of participants allocated to the control group was unlikely in a further eight studies where the intervention was directed at recipients rather than providers (<LINK REF="STD-Barley-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Barley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eakin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eakin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochhalter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochhalter 2010</LINK>), but was possible in the remaining studies four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2012</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK> provided an appendix outlining potential contamination and indicated that it was minimal and, if it had occurred, it would have diluted rather than increased the significant effect size of their intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK> stated that contamination of control participants who attended the same general practitioners (GPs) as the intervention participants could have occurred but that a cluster design would have been more problematic due to differential prescribing patterns between practices. All studies had low risk of selective outcome reporting and had no apparent other biases.</P>
<P>The five cluster randomised controlled trials accounted for clustering effects in their analysis so there were no unit of analysis errors (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. In general, while all the included studies were RCTs the main limitation related to a lack of consistency of effect for most outcomes. Only the mental health outcomes, largely relating to depression in the comorbidity studies, were regarded as having a high GRADE ranking. We downgraded the evidence for effects on clinical and patient-reported outcomes to moderate due to lack of consistency of effect across studies and small effect sizes. We downgraded the evidence for effects on provider behaviour to moderate, due to limited available data for calculation of standardised effect sizes (SES) and lack of clarity regarding the clinical importance of the results. We downgraded the evidence for effects on health service utilisation and medication use and adherence to low, due to variation across studies and small effect sizes. We did not include economic outcomes in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> due to the lack of robust economic analyses, rather we summarised this outcome in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>

We undertook two meta-analyses: a meta-analysis of Patient Health Questionnaire, version 9 (HQ9) depression scores; and a meta-analysis of standardised mean difference (SMD) in depression scores for the studies with available data where depression was a targeted condition. This suggests a modest intervention effect. The meta-analysis for PHQ9 scores had high heterogeneity so we do not report the pooled effect (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). The SMD for other depression scores was &#8722;0.41 (95% CI &#8722;0.63 to &#8722;0.20) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The range in SESs for depression outcomes across these studies was from 0.09 to 2.24 with five of the nine outcomes indicating moderate to large effect sizes (i.e. SES &gt; 0.5). These higher effect sizes were all reported in the studies in which depression was a focus of the intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Patient-reported outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the organisational-type studies presented patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).</P>
<P>Nine of these reported a variety of HRQoL measures with a range of effects from SES of 0.03 to 1.7. Only one of the nine studies reported a large effect size (<LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK>). Two studies reported small effect sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2013</LINK>).

The mixed evidence regarding HRQoL is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK> which includes studies with available data but the pooled effect is not reported due to high statistical heterogeneity (I² = 73%).</P>
<P>Five organisational studies reported on self-efficacy with a range in SES of 0.03 to 0.11, suggesting minimal effect.

<P>Two of the organisational studies reported measures relating to disability or impaired activities of daily living (IADL). <LINK REF="STD-Hogg-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogg 2009</LINK> reported no effect of interventions on IADL, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2015</LINK> reported an improvement in the Sheehan Disability score in intervention participants.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barley-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Barley 2014</LINK> undertook a parallel economic analysis of the UPBEAT intervention and found that the intervention demonstrated marginal cost effectiveness up to a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold of GBP 3035.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Leff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leff 2009</LINK> et al provided initial cost data from <LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK> and indicated a saving related to Guided Care of USD 75,000 per guided care nurse (95% CI USD &#8722;244,000 to USD 150,900) or USD 1364 per individual.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK> reported the direct mean medical costs relating to the TeamCare intervention over a 12 month period as USD 1224 per individual.

The intervention was associated with lower OPD costs with a reduction of USD 594 per person (95% CI USD &#8722;3241 to USD 2053). There was a 99.7% probability that the intervention met the threshold of less than USD 20,000 per QALY.

All six aimed to address participant health-related behaviour and did not engage or involve individuals' current health-care providers directly. The results from these six studies were mixed and do not suggest that patient-oriented interventions are generally effective.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 15:57:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have identified 18 studies eligible for inclusion in the review, 10 from the original review and 8 added in the current update. All 18 were randomised controlled trials with a generally low risk of bias. Even within this small number of studies, there was significant variation in participants and interventions. In nine of the 18 studies, the focus was on comorbid conditions, which were eligible for inclusion as their interventions had a multimorbidity focus in that they were directed at the pre-specified comorbid conditions. The commonest combinations of conditions included depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the other studies, which included people with general multimorbidity, the focus tended to be on older individuals.</P>
<P>The results suggest that interventions that are targeted at specific risk factor management (for example management of vascular risk factors and depression in people with comorbid vascular disease and depression) or focused on areas where people have difficulties, such as with functional ability or medicines management, are more likely to be effective. Given the importance of developing interventions for people with multimorbidity, the review provides interesting insights into the types of intervention components that are being examined. However, the majority of interventions in included studies had multiple components incorporating different elements, making comparison of intervention effects difficult. We categorised the intervention components using the EPOC taxonomy and identified the predominant intervention element for each study and then grouped studies depending on whether they had a predominantly organisational or patient focus. When examining the effectiveness of interventions by intervention type, we concluded that organisational type interventions, for example, the introduction of clinical nurse specialists to support treatment of depression or a focus on specific risk factor management in commonly co-occurring conditions such as diabetes and hypertension may be more effective. Interventions that target areas where people have particular difficulties, such as functional ability, are also more likely to be effective. The current evidence suggests that organisational interventions that have a broader focus, such as case management or changes in care delivery for all individuals with multimorbidity, seem less effective. Patient-oriented interventions that are not linked to healthcare delivery also seem less effective. Two of the three patient-oriented interventions that were delivered by professionals showed improvements in a range of outcomes including reduced mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Garvey-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2009</LINK>) following focused and intensive interventions targeting functional difficulty, activity participation and falls prevention.</P>
<P>We have presented results by outcomes pre-specified in the protocol. In general these results were mixed and inconclusive, though there was a tendency for improvements in the studies that targeted common comorbid conditions that included depression. There was not a strong focus on clinical outcomes, particularly for the multimorbidity studies and this may reflect the challenge in research in multimorbidity when disease-specific measures cannot be used.</P>
<P>There was limited effect on patient-reported health outcomes such as HRQoL and on outcomes relating to health service utilisation and mixed effects on hospital admission rates and outcomes relating to medication use, and adherence. Five studies reported patient health behaviour outcomes with a tendency for these to be improved in the studies targeting comorbid conditions. There has been ongoing interest in the potential for improved patient self efficacy to lead to better self management and improved health outcomes. Self efficacy represents an outcome that is not disease or condition focused and was examined in many of the included studies. However, the majority of studies including this outcome showed no effect.</P>
<P>Costs were presented in six studies but only two studies conducted cost-effectiveness analyses and it was not possible to compare outcomes across studies. The results relating to improved prescribing and risk factor management, in some of the comorbidity trials, indicate a potential for these interventions to reduce health service costs over longer periods of time.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:01:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the studies in this review are relatively recent reflecting the fact that this is a new area conceptually and that research to date has focused on description and impact rather than the evaluation of the effectives of interventions. The majority of newer studies included in this update and those studies identified as ongoing, focus on common comorbidities rather than on multimorbidity in general. In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>), only two of the ten included studies had interventions that focused on comorbid conditions whereas in this updated review, this has increased to nine of the 18 included studies. The tendency towards significant improvements in mental health outcomes in the comorbidity studies is likely related to the strong focus in these interventions on targeting the specific conditions involved, particularly depression. It is more challenging to design interventions for people with a broad range of conditions. The studies that seem more effective in the general multimorbidity group are those which had interventions targeted at specific areas of concern for participants, such as improving functional ability, which is not disease specific. One of the larger multimorbidity studies included involved a large well-designed and executed RCT, the Guided Care study, which tested a broad organisational-type intervention targeted at high risk individuals with multimorbidity, but which found no overall effect (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>). However, a pre-planned sub-group analysis indicated improvements in the use of some health services in the participants enrolled in one of the participating care plans (Kaiser-Permanente, n = 365, 43% of full sample). <LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK> postulated that this result may have been related to the fact that care was already more organised and structured in this system, so that the Guided Care intervention may simply have extended the existing approaches used in that setting whereas its implementation was more challenging in less organised systems. However the results of sub-group analysis, even when pre-planned, need to be interpreted with caution given the relatively small samples sizes involved. Nonetheless, the differences in these sub-groups highlight the importance of the healthcare delivery setting into which new interventions are added. Indeed, some of the patient-oriented interventions seemed to run independently of people's healthcare delivery, particularly those that recruited participants from the community rather than through healthcare providers. Most of these studies had limited effectiveness, highlighting the importance of considering the overall recipient experience and integrating interventions into the healthcare system. The results of the patient-oriented intervention studies are consistent with the <LINK REF="REF-Foster-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2007</LINK> Cochrane review on lay-led self-management support programme, which concluded that there is no evidence that these interventions improve psychological health, symptoms or health-related quality of life, or that they significantly alter healthcare use.</P>
<P>The evidence from this review partially addresses the review question, i.e. what interventions can effectively improve outcomes in people with multimorbidity. It suggests that interventions such as the addition of clinical care protocols need to be targeted at populations with defined combinations of common conditions such as diabetes and depression or heart disease; or need to focus on specific problems experienced by people in multimorbidity populations, for example a multidisciplinary team intervention that addresses functional difficulties. However, even when interventions are targeted they may not be effective for appropriate use of medications. The <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK> Cochrane review of Interventions for enhancing medication adherence concludes that "current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective" and suggests further research is needed. People with multimorbidity may have more specific problems with medicines use that relate to polypharmacy and managing complex drug treatment regimens, so medicines management interventions targeting these specific difficulties may be more effective.</P>
<P>Most of the multimorbidity studies in this review focused on older people; however, it is important to address the needs of younger individuals as there are issues relating to employability and absenteeism. Research in Scotland has highlighted that individuals in the poorest socioeconomic groups are more likely to develop multimorbidity at a younger age and more likely to die prematurely as a result (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 2012</LINK>). Acting upstream for younger people with multimorbidity is preventive and has potential to bring about significant quality of life benefits for individuals as well as cost savings for healthcare systems. However, even in ageing populations, multimorbidity worsens outcomes so there is still likely to be room for improvement, at least in ambulatory care patients.</P>
<P>The evidence to guide intervention development for individuals with multimorbidity is increasing and evolving rapidly. A number of ongoing studies have been identified and we anticipate that future updates of the review will improve the available evidence to inform policy makers and those planning services for individuals with multimorbidity.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:02:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the included studies were randomised controlled trials. Overall they were of reasonable quality with minimal risk of bias, although blinding of participants and clinicians involved in the types of interventions included in this review is often impossible. Multimorbidity is a complex area because the characteristics of participants can vary depending on definitions used. This limits the potential to reasonably combine study results for meta-analysis which is reflected in the high heterogeneity in the meta-analyses undertaken for the review update, and potentially limits the internal validity of the results of the review.</P>

<P>The review was carried out in accordance with EPOC guidelines and using the updated <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>). Potential limitations in the search process relate to the lack of a MeSH term for multimorbidity. This meant that we had to use broad search terms which led to a high yield of citations to be searched. However, the authors are active researchers in the field of multimorbidity and are unaware of any potentially eligible studies that were missed by the search. We were also unable to retrieve some missing data from authors. However, as limited meta-analyses were undertaken this did not lead to any appreciable measurement bias.</P>
<P>In addition, it must be noted that when we address complex interventions in primary care, there is always a context in which those interventions take place. A systematic review does not address the context that could have influenced the results in individual studies as there was limited reporting of external validity or generalisability in individual trials. The usual limitations relating to publication bias apply but we have searched the grey literature and contacted experts in the field to try and identify published and ongoing trials in this area.<BR/>

<P>We were unable to group sufficient numbers of studies with similar interventions in order to comment on which elements of interventions (e.g. the use of community pharmacists) seemed most effective and compare our review to other reviews of these interventions. The most consistent intervention element across all included studies was the use of case managers, but even these varied in that some were clinical case managers and others were administrative managers. The Cochrane review of the effect of case management on health care outcomes is ongoing but does plan to address differences in effectiveness between different types of case management (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2000</LINK>). Systematic reviews of community-based case management in general have indicated mixed effects with improvements in client and professional satisfaction with care and reductions in caregiver strain but no impact on healthcare utilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Challis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Challis 2014</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:05:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multimorbidity is common in clinical practice and is an important problem in most healthcare systems. While the evidence supporting specific intervention types is limited, it does suggest that clinicians and policy makers should prioritise interventions that target specific problems experienced by people with multimorbidity or should target common comorbid conditions. However, we can only be moderately certain that this is the case and new services and interventions should be evaluated robustly to contribute to the much-needed evidence to support clinical practice. The epidemiological data on the impact of multimorbidity highlights the specific challenges for people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 2012</LINK>); and interventions targeting this population have the potential to address health inequalities. One of the ongoing studies specifically targets multimorbidity in areas of deprivation (<LINK REF="STD-Mercer-ongoing" TYPE="STUDY">Mercer ongoing</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sub-group analysis from the Guided Care study discussed above suggests that multimorbidity interventions need to be integrated into existing healthcare systems to support implementation and sustainability (<LINK REF="STD-Boult-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boult 2011</LINK>). Independent interventions that do not integrate with existing healthcare systems will be difficult to sustain. Many of the included studies focused on integration of care between practitioners, but we also need to consider how interventions can be integrated into healthcare systems. It is likely that local adaptations will need to be made even for interventions that are effective. For example, we are confident in the review findings that interventions targeting comorbid depression are effective but these interventions require training and support for primary care clinicians which may not be available in all settings.</P>
<P>The literature on multimorbidity indicates that it is generally associated with poorer outcomes for patients. However, health planners and policy makers need to consider which outcomes they want to target in an intervention. This should be considered in the early stages of the development of a potential new intervention. People with multimorbidity are not only at higher risk of many adverse outcomes, but they are also more likely to experience 'treatment burden', that is that the effort needed to engage in the multiple treatments offered to them actually make their lives more difficult (<LINK REF="REF-May-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 2009</LINK>). Having the individual participate in priority setting based on his/her values and preferences becomes both the rational and the ethical thing to do.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:09:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definitions</HEADING>
<P>There is a need for a clear conceptual definition of multimorbidity and its differentiation from other related concepts such as comorbidity, complexity, frailty, and vulnerability. The variation in definitions in the studies included in this review highlight the need for clear reporting of participant characteristics to allow consideration of external validity and generalisability. This will be particularly important given the need to account for the heterogeneity of multimorbidity; interventions could have differential effects depending on the definition or degree of multimorbidity and the socioeconomic status of participants.</P>
<P>Without these definitions and consideration of related concepts, the generalisability or applicability of studies for people with multimorbidity (with a broader definition than only two or three specific diseases) will be uncertain, as is the case for many of the studies in this review, particularly those with the specific comorbidity focus (<LINK REF="REF-Fortin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortin 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We would also advocate for including multimorbidity as a MeSH term as the search strategy for this review and for ongoing work on multimorbidity is particularly complex and time consuming, given the growing concern and interest in the issue.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study design</HEADING>
<P>While the risk of bias was generally low in this review and all studies were RCTs, we acknowledge the challenge of conducting organisational type interventions using optimal RCT designs, so pragmatic trials or quasi-experimental studies may also be appropriate while still maintaining rigour. This could include the use of stepped wedge cluster RCTs that would involve regional introduction of organisational or health system delivery change while still allowing for robust evaluation.</P>
<P>Future studies need to carefully consider the comparison or control group, particularly in relation to contamination of control participants. Cluster randomised designs are likely to be optimal if interventions are delivered through care providers. This needs to be taken into account both in terms of power calculations and in the analysis of results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>This review indicates that interventions that are targeted at either specific combinations of common conditions such as comorbid depression, or at specific problems for people with multiple conditions, may be more effective. When designing interventions researchers should be clear about the theoretical assumptions underlying the intervention, consider its individual components and the evidence base behind each and then link these to outcomes as outlined below. They should also consider interventions that are likely to be reproducible and applicable within the context of primary care. The Medical Research Council Framework for the Design and Evaluation of complex interventions designed to improve health, provides useful guidance in designing and undertaking these trials (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-Framework-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC Framework 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A group of researchers active in the area of multimorbidity has developed a specific framework for the development of interventions for multimorbidity which is based on a series of workshops undertaken over a two-year period combined with the experience of this expert group (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2013</LINK>). This framework highlights the potential for other study designs such as stepped wedge designs that may be more suited to multimorbidity intervention initiatives and that can be undertaken within service/ research partnerships. The framework also stresses the importance of clearly describing all intervention components to allow replicability and generalisability to other settings.</P>
<P>Within this review, inter professional collaboration was embedded in all interventions. This is worth building on for future intervention development. Most of the included studies focused on changing professional care provision; it may also be worthwhile incorporating the participants' perspective. This could be achieved by adopting a participatory approach to intervention development. People with multimorbidity, their family members, and a range of professionals involved should be consulted during the modelling and exploratory phases of service and intervention planning.</P>
<P>The majority of the evidence for effective chronic disease management has been based on a single disease paradigm. However, it is likely that participants in these trials had some degree of multimorbidity, though sicker individuals may have been excluded. This is also the case for trials examining interventions for frail older people or for interventions seeking to improve care transitions as many participants in these studies also have multimorbidity though this is not usually clearly reported or addressed as a potential confounding variable. We should therefore seek to build on and apply the evidence regarding effective interventions for single conditions or related interventions to people with multimorbidity, rather than designing interventions with no consideration of the existing evidence base for single conditions.</P>
<P>In its broadest sense, multimorbidity encompasses a large variety of individuals which must be considered as it is not pragmatic to design interventions that change systems completely. For this reason, parallel economic analyses that link outcomes to costs and benefits are better than providing simple cost data alone, which make comparison across studies difficult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The challenge with multimorbidity is to define a set of outcomes that can be used for different combination of diseases, so there is a need for generic outcomes measures that incorporate physical functioning, quality of life and measure of treatment burden that are responsive to change over time. Other outcomes to consider include goal attainment, self care, self efficacy, health related quality of life, distress, adherence to treatment, behavioural changes regarding health habits, individuals' knowledge about care plans, shared decision making, and participation in care. However, unless validated measures are used, many of these outcomes will not be comparable across studies. The recent work of PROMIS (<LINK REF="REF-PROMIS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">PROMIS 2011</LINK>) provides validated and useful patient-reported outcomes that will be particularly relevant for those researching interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity. Work to develop a core outcome set for multimorbidity using methodology recommended by the COMET initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/) is ongoing.</P>
<P>Most of the interventions in this review used a conceptual model, particularly the Chronic Care Model. In general there needs to be clearer reporting of intervention development and outcomes chosen to reflect the theoretical underpinning as to how and why an intervention might work. It would also be helpful if authors clearly identified intervention elements and matched outcomes to these elements in an effort to clarify which components of multifaceted interventions are more effective than others.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conclusion</HEADING>
<P>This review highlights the relatively limited but growing evidence underpinning interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity with the focus to date being on comorbid conditions or multimorbidity in older individuals. The results suggest that interventions to date have had mixed effects but have shown a tendency to improve outcomes if organisational interventions can be targeted at risk factors in common comorbidities such as depression or multidisciplinary team interventions focused on specific functional difficulties in people with multimorbidity. Due to the number of studies and their low risk of bias, we can be confident that there is an effect on depression outcomes in the comorbidity studies that included treatment for depression but there are fewer studies supporting the conclusions for targeting functional difficulties in multimorbidity generally and these findings may change as new evidence becomes available. However, further research is needed and future interventions should be developed in ways that allow rigorous evaluations to be performed that will add to the evidence. There is a need for clear and broader definitions of participants, consideration of appropriate outcomes, and further pragmatic studies based in primary care settings.</P>

<P>During the initial review process, the authors decided, following a suggestion from a peer reviewer, that interventions should be excluded if they only targeted one condition as this was contrary to the emphasis on multimorbidity. This led to the exclusion of some studies examining comorbid depression and other conditions where the intervention was only targeted at depression treatment.</P>
<P>Changes were also made to the original search strategy in the protocol, based on initial results from the original searches. The searches used in the review are presented as appendices.</P>
<P>We had planned to contact authors of other reviews in the field of multimorbidity that were retrieved during the search process regarding relevant studies that they may be aware of, but no other reviews of interventions were identified.</P>
<P>We had planned to prepare tables and funnel plots comparing effect sizes of studies grouped according to potential effect modifiers (for example, simple versus multifaceted interventions) if sufficient studies had been identified but this was not possible.</P>
<P>If there had been enough studies, we had planned to use meta-regression to see whether the effect sizes could be predicted by study characteristics. These could, for example, include duration of the intervention, age groups, and simple versus multifaceted interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1994</LINK>). We also considered formal tests of homogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1994</LINK>). None of these quantitative methods were possible for this version of the review but will be considered for future review updates</P>
<P>We had planned, if possible, to consider subgroup analyses based on the degree of multimorbidity of participants. This would have been based on the number of conditions per person. This was not possible.</P>
<P>We initially used the term psychosocial measures to group measures of well-being, quality of life, function and psychological measures such as illness perceptions. We have replaced this with the more commonly used term 'patient-reported outcome measures'. We have re-named 'physical health outcomes' as 'clinical outcomes' for this update of the review.</P>

<FOOTNOTES>
<P>We downgraded the evidence for effects on clinical and psychosocial outcomes to moderate due to lack of consistency of effect across studies and small effect sizes. We downgraded the evidence for effects on provider behaviour to moderate due to limited available data for calculation of standardised effect sizes (SES) and lack of clarity regarding the clinical importance of the results. We downgraded the evidence for effects on health service utilisation and medication use and adherence to low due to variation across studies and small effect sizes.</P>
