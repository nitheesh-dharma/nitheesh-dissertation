<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-16 06:28:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening is generally seen as an effective and safe method to prevent diseases, but there are risks and disadvantages with the procedures involved. It is important for the person undergoing screening to know about the risks of the disease and also how this is relevant to him or her. Such information would help people to make an informed choice about taking up a screening procedure.</P>
<P>In this review we looked at studies that provided personalised risk information for each participant, so that he or she could make a decision about whether to undergo screening, based on their personal risk profile. We found 41 studies with 28,700 participants that provided such personalised risk information to the participants. We integrated the results of all these studies and found that when such a risk profile was included in the intervention, the participants made more informed decisions about screening, compared to people who were provided with more general risk information. Overall 45.2% (592/1309) of participants who received personalised risk information made informed choices as compared to 20.2% (229/1135) of participants who received generic risk information.</P>
<P>We also found that these interventions seemed to increase knowledge and may increase accuracy of risk perception in the trial participants. However they did not significantly affect participants' anxiety. The results also indicated that providing people with personalised risks of the disease resulted in a small increase in the number of people who undertook the screening procedure. The results from this review are dominated by studies screening for breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Caution is required in applying these results to other types of screening.</P>

<P>There is a trend towards greater patient involvement in healthcare decisions. Although screening is usually perceived as good for the health of the population, there are risks associated with the tests involved. Achieving both adequate involvement of consumers and informed decision making are now seen as important goals for screening programmes.

<P>To assess the effects of personalised risk communication on informed decision making by individuals taking screening tests. We also assess individual components that constitute informed decisions.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-30 21:18:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>Issue 3, 2012), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) and PsycINFO (OvidSP) without language restrictions. We searched from 2006 to March 2012. The date ranges for the previous searches were from 1989 to December 2005 for PsycINFO and from 1985 to December 2005 for other databases. For the original version of this review, we also searched CancerLit  and Science Citation Index (March 2001). We also reviewed the reference lists and conducted citation searches of included studies and other systematic reviews in the field, to identify any studies missed during the initial search.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:46:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials incorporating an intervention with a 'personalised risk communication element&#8217; for individuals undergoing screening procedures, and reporting measures of informed decisions and also cognitive, affective, or behavioural outcomes addressing the decision by such individuals, of whether or not to undergo screening.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:46:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed each included trial for risk of bias, and extracted data. We extracted data about the nature and setting of interventions, and relevant outcome data. We used standard statistical methods to combine data using RevMan version 5, including analysis according to different levels of detail of personalised risk communication, different conditions for screening, and studies based only on high-risk participants rather than people at 'average&#8217; risk.<B> </B>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-20 03:52:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 41 studies involving 28,700 people. Nineteen new studies were identified in this update, adding to the 22 studies included in the previous two iterations of the review. Three studies measured informed decision with regard to the uptake of screening following personalised risk communication as a part of their intervention. All of these three studies were at low risk of bias and there was strong evidence that the interventions enhanced informed decision making, although with heterogeneous results. Overall 45.2% (592/1309) of participants who received personalised risk information made informed choices, compared to 20.2% (229/1135) of participants who received generic risk information. The overall odds ratios (ORs) for informed decision were 4.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.62 to 5.53 for fixed effect) and 3.65 (95% CI 2.13 to 6.23 for random effects). Nine studies measured increase in knowledge, using different scales. All of these studies showed an increase in knowledge with personalised risk communication. In three studies the interventions showed a trend towards more accurate risk perception, but the evidence was of poor quality. Four out of six studies reported non-significant changes in anxiety following personalised risk communication to the participants. Overall there was a small non-significant decrease in the anxiety scores. Most studies (32/41) measured the uptake of screening tests following interventions. Our results (OR 1.15 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.29)) constitute low quality evidence, consistent with a small effect, that personalised risk communication in which a risk score was provided (6 studies) or the participants were given their categorised risk (6 studies), increases uptake of screening tests. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:46:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is strong evidence from three trials that personalised risk estimates incorporated within communication interventions for screening programmes enhance informed choices. However the evidence for increasing the uptake of such screening tests with similar interventions is weak, and it is not clear if this increase is associated with informed choices. Studies included a diverse range of screening programmes. Therefore, data from this review do not allow us to draw conclusions about the best interventions to deliver personalised risk communication for enhancing informed decisions. The results are dominated by findings from the topic area of mammography and colorectal cancer. Caution is therefore required in generalising from these results, and particularly for clinical topics other than mammography and colorectal cancer screening.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-24 09:56:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk communication is an integral part of modern healthcare practice. It is important in various strategies to help individuals make the right choices. Be it a public screening programme or a matter of starting a new treatment, providing evidence-based risk and benefit information to patients, and ensuring they understand it, forms the cornerstone of informed decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Naik-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naik 2012</LINK>). However, understanding is still limited of how best to present and discuss risks and benefits of health care in general, and screening in particular, for an individual.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Screening: what are the issues around policies and practice?</HEADING>
<P>Screening is defined as "the systematic application of a test or inquiry, to identify individuals at sufficient risk of a specific disorder to warrant further investigation or direct preventive action, amongst persons who have not sought medical attention on account of symptoms of that disorder"(<LINK REF="REF-UKNSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKNSC 1998</LINK>).<I> </I>
</P>
<P>Many tests and procedures form part of screening programs - programs with the objective of sorting out apparently well persons who probably have a disease, from those who probably do not. They may only highlight a risk of disease, and are not intended to definitely diagnose a disease or condition. Screening is a complex event that can have various outcomes for the participant, some of which can cause unnecessary distress (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2011</LINK>). Although screening programmes are generally seen as an effective measure to reduce mortality and morbidity in the target populations, there are several issues surrounding them. The evolution of evidence regarding certain screening programmes has led to fierce debate about actual benefits and harms (<LINK REF="REF-Bewley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bewley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hackshaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackshaw 2012</LINK>). A recent review of breast cancer screening for example, suggests that it is unclear whether such screening does more harm than good, and that balanced, evidence-based risk-benefit information should be provided to help women make an informed decision about undergoing screening (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2011</LINK>). Directly harmful effects of screening include: complications arising from the investigation, adverse effects of treatment, unnecessary treatment of persons with true-positive test results who have inconsequential disease, adverse effects of labelling or early diagnosis, anxiety generated by the investigations and treatment, and the costs or inconvenience incurred during investigations and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 1999</LINK>)<B>.</B> Other harms, such as failure to detect disease, only apply to those with the condition. In either of these scenarios, <LINK REF="REF-Raffle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raffle 2001</LINK> warns that "harm to uninformed participants leads to anger, bitterness, and potentially to litigation". Furthermore screening can have significant social and psychological costs which are difficult to evaluate and quantify (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart_x002d_Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart-Brown 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>These well recognised potential harms have led to increasing debate about the policy and practice of screening. A review of breast cancer screening policy has been proposed in the United Kingdom (UK), prompted by concerns about the accuracy and transparency of information provided to women about the benefits and harms of screening (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2011</LINK>). The American Cancer Society has also highlighted the confusion created by screening guidelines, and proposes providing the public with clear guidance about the benefits, limitations, and harms associated with taking a screening test (<LINK REF="REF-Brawley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brawley 2012</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Informed decision making</HEADING>
<P>An informed decision is defined as one where "a reasoned choice is made by a reasonable individual using relevant information about the advantages and disadvantages of all the possible courses of action, in accord with the individual&#8217;s beliefs" (<LINK REF="REF-Bekker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekker 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The UK national guidance confirms that the purpose of information about screening is to ensure that participants can make a fully informed choice about whether to take the test (<LINK REF="REF-GMC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">GMC 1998</LINK>). The UK National Screening Committee some time ago proposed a new definition for screening to incorporate the importance of informed choice in screening:</P>
<P>"a public health service in which members of a defined population, who do not necessarily perceive they are at risk of, or are already affected by, a disease or its complications, are asked a question or offered a test to identify those individuals who are more likely to be helped than harmed by further tests or treatment to reduce the risk of disease or its complication<I>s" </I>(<LINK REF="REF-UKNSC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKNSC 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>Jepson and colleagues reiterate this policy and recommend evaluating screening programmes to ensure that people invited for screening are genuinely making informed choices, and explore how comprehensive information affects other variables such as uptake, cost effectiveness, and satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2005</LINK>)<B>. </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">How can informed decisions be measured?</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Briss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 2004</LINK>
<B> </B>provides a conceptual framework for informed decision making which includes: knowledge, participation in decision making at a personally desirable level, and consistency between the decision and individual preferences or values. A systematic review by Mullen et al, on measures of informed decision making in cancer screening, observed no single study measuring all of these three aspects (<LINK REF="REF-Mullen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 2006</LINK>). They recommended the development and use of validated measures of informed decision making and the use of theoretical frameworks for such screening studies.</P>
<P>Marteau and colleagues have proposed the multi-dimensional measure of informed choice, which has been validated for Down&#8217;s syndrome screening (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2001</LINK>). This is based on assessing the consistency between knowledge, attitudes to tests and choices of uptake of tests. To date, few studies in screening have used this scale as a measure for informed choice<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steckelberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steckelberg 2011</LINK>). This scale is promising and could form the basis for development of a universal measure of informed choice for uptake of screening tests.  Further research is needed to validate this scale in other areas. Furthermore, increasingly the outcomes described in the literature include 'affective' measures such as satisfaction with the decision made, and 'decisional conflict'. This includes whether an individual feels a decision is consistent with their personal values, and certainty about making the right decision<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes_x002d_Rovner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes-Rovner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llewelyn_x002d_Thomas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llewelyn-Thomas 1995</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What is tailoring and why is personalising risk information important?</HEADING>
<P>Tailored health communication refers to providing information to someone based on characteristics that are unique to that person. Kreuter et al define tailoring as: "Any combination of information or change strategies intended to reach one specific person, based on characteristics that are unique to that person, related to the outcome of interest and have been derived from an individual assessment"<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Kreuter-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuter 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreuter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuter 1999b</LINK>)<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>Tailoring could address any characteristics such as the person&#8217;s educational background, cultural orientation, and general level of comprehension. Many studies have adopted a theoretically-driven approach and have tailored their interventions on behavioural constructs that are based on behaviour change models  (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007</LINK>), for example the Transtheoretical Model (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1997</LINK>)<B> </B>and Heath Belief Model (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A high rate of participation is expected in most established screening programmes to ensure that they run effectively. Health authorities may employ a variety of strategies to promote screening and enhance uptake amongst the target populations. Some screening programmes provide information which is personally tailored and more relevant to the person in question. Others provide information about population or 'average' risks of contracting a disease as a basis for discussion or decision making about undergoing screening, or perhaps simply to try to motivate people to attend for tests which are perceived by authorities to be in the person's or population's best interests (<LINK REF="REF-Slaytor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slaytor 1998</LINK>). Such tactics may be seen as questionable, working against the spirit of informed decision making and consumer autonomy, and amounting to a disregard for the principles of medical ethics and good practice (<LINK REF="REF-Beauchamp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beauchamp 2001</LINK>). Foster and Anderson (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1998</LINK>)<B> </B>criticise the implementers of the UK's National Cervical Screening Programme, including general practitioners, for their persuasive tactics in getting patients to comply.</P>
<P>According to the Health Belief Model one of the key determinants of health-related behaviour is perceived threat (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1974</LINK>). This is made up of two components: the individuals perceiving themselves as susceptible to the disease, and the perceived severity of the disease. Tailoring information using an individual&#8217;s specific risk factors is what we describe as 'personalised risk communication', sometimes also called 'individualised risk communication'. This may be based on the individual's own risk factors for a condition (such as age or family history). In some cases it is calculated from an individual's risk factors using formulae derived from epidemiological data, with the information presented as an absolute risk or as a risk score, for example the Gail score for the risk of breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1989</LINK>)<B> </B>and Q-risk score for cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hippisley_x002d_Cox-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippisley-Cox 2008</LINK>). Risk information may also be categorised into, for example, high, medium or low risk groups. It may be less detailed, involving a listing, for example, of a person's risk factors as a focus for discussion and intervention.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-30 21:34:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence suggests that the format in which risk information is presented affects patients&#8217; understanding and perception of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2012</LINK>). It is assumed that tailored messages are perceived as more relevant to an individual, and are therefore better processed and understood (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 2005</LINK>). Foster and Anderson (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1998</LINK>) have emphasised the importance of providing good-quality information to those undergoing cervical screening procedures. They stress that women should be made aware of the risks (discomfort, over-treatment of abnormal smears) and limitations (false positives; false negatives), as well as the benefits of the test. Further, they also point out that people have different risks of contracting the cervical cancer, based on factors such as age, sexual activity, social class and smoking.  A systematic review  of studies with interventions designed to provide tailored information on cancer risk and screening method has shown that personally-tailored risk information improved subjects' knowledge and realistic perception of cancer risk, compared to the provision of generic risk information only (<LINK REF="REF-Albada-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albada 2009</LINK>). Noar et al found in their meta-analytic review that tailored messages outperformed comparison messages in affecting health behaviour change, lending support to claims made by other authors of narrative reviews that tailoring does in fact 'work' (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is recognition that uptake of tests per se is not necessarily desirable (for example, prostate specific antigen screening and antenatal cystic fibrosis screening are contentious areas). Also some screening tests are only recommended for those who are at high risk for disease susceptibility, for example genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-US-PSTF-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">US PSTF 2005</LINK>). Making an informed choice about taking screening tests, and adherence to the consumer's chosen option, are widely regarded as more desirable goals for risk communication (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liao 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarfati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarfati 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this light, providing individualised risk information may seem to be more pertinent than providing generic risk information about the disease for which the screening intervention is designed. Personalised risk communication is more likely to be useful in decision making about whether or not to participate in screening, and individuals who perceive their personal risk as high may feel more susceptible to the disease in question. They may weigh this risk information with the harmful effects of screening, leading to an informed choice to take up the test. Similarly, those who consider themselves at low or no risk may opt out of the screening programme.</P>

<P>The UK National Health Service incorporates 11 different screening activities within its national health programme (<LINK REF="REF-UK-National-Screening-Portal" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK National Screening Portal</LINK>). In England alone, 2.24 million women were sent invitations to attend breast cancer screening in 2010-11 (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2011a</LINK>). Invitations to attend cervical cancer screening were sent to 1.79 million women (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Information-Centre-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Information Centre 2011b</LINK>)<B>. </B>Significant volumes of screening procedures can also be expected to be taking place within breast and cervical cancer programmes and other screening programmes globally. People invited for such screening procedures should make informed and balanced choices. However, focusing narrowly on this outcome may ignore conflicting implications for uptake, cost-effectiveness and other important public health goals. Stakeholders and policy makers must carefully consider these factors. We attempt to organise such evidence, wherever available, in this systematic review. Further research would certainly be necessary to place the findings of this review in context with existing or planned screening programmes.</P>

<P>Risk communication itself may be subdivided by the dyad involved (for example between agencies and the public, or from individual communicators), as well as according to the nature of the risk, which may be familiar or non-familiar (<LINK REF="REF-Vlek-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlek 1987</LINK>). Reviews of 'mass' risk communication, primarily from the environmental health discipline (<LINK REF="REF-Covello-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covello 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischhoff-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischhoff 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeney-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeney 1986</LINK>), and from narrow clinical fields such as familial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bottorff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bottorff 1996</LINK>), are available. <LINK REF="REF-Briss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 2004</LINK> also reviewed interventions that sought to promote informed decisions about cancer screening, but not through 'personalising' risk information. In addressing the effects of personalised methods of risk communication, this review focuses on risk communication which is provided, used and evaluated in healthcare encounters with individuals, couples, or immediate families (for example, parents of young children). As such, the review is broader than previous clinical risk communication reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bottorff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bottorff 1996</LINK>) but still aims to be relevant to the community and the clinical needs of healthcare professionals across a range of disciplines. It focuses on the domain of healthcare screening. In contrast, Albada and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Albada-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albada 2009</LINK>) in their systematic review have reviewed interventions that provided tailored information specifically about cancer risk and screening.  Information in the included studies was tailored to the personal characteristics related to behaviour change theories or constructs, and to the participant&#8217;s individualised risks. Their main outcome measures were risk perception, cancer knowledge and screening behaviour. A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2011</LINK>) evaluated randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of decision aids that provided information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to standard care. Decision attributes, behavioural, health, and health system effects were studied as outcome measures. Several other reviews have sought to consolidate evidence on the most effective means of increasing screening uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Bonfill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonfill 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Everett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everett 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flight-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flight 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>The interventions comprise one of the three levels of personalised risk information:</P>
<UL>
<LI>individualised risk score or individual actual risk information (i.e. absolute or relative risk information); or</LI>

<P>The interventions address decision making about screening tests; that is, testing whose objective is the presumptive identification of unrecognised disease or defect (including genetic markers for disease) by the application of tests or other procedures, which can be applied rapidly. These tests are intended to sort out apparently well people who may have a disease from those who probably do not, and they are not intended to be diagnostic (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1968</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk communication intervention could come before screening, at the time of the screening intervention, or at the time of counselling or promotion of screening. Personalised risk communication could be delivered via oral, written, video, or electronic (e.g. Internet or CD-ROM) media.</P>
<P>Personalised risk information is compared to generalised risk communication interventions, including: population risk estimates, general information on risk factors, or general encouragement to acknowledge risks or change risk behaviour.</P>

Data to be studied were entered and meta-analysed in the statistical software package incorporated within RevMan 5. Outcome data extracted comprised the absolute changes in numbers between groups (for dichotomous variables), and the mean change and standard deviation of the mean change (for continuous variables). From these, we calculated the odd ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. When the same outcomes were measured on different scales we used SMDs when combining data in the meta-analysis. For cluster randomised studies, we used the generic inverse variance method to incorporate the adjusted ORs and the MDs. We also used the generic inverse variance method to combine studies where the raw data were not available, despite contacting the authors for further information. We recorded the statistical significance of results for all analysed outcomes. Insufficient data were provided in many studies to enable (raw) data entry into RevMan 5.</P>

All were published in English. Thirty-four were from the USA, four from Australia, one from Canada, one from Germany and one from the UK. There appeared to be increasing interest in the subject over time, with no studies published in the 1980s, 14 studies published in the 1990s and 27 published after 1999. The studies varied in size, with 4 studies involving less than 200 patients, 19 studies involving between 200 and 500 patients, 9 studies involving 500 to 1000 patients and 9 studies involving over 1000 patients.</P>
<P>All included studies were RCTs. Five studies used cluster randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazebrook-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glazebrook 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manne-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Manne 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>), of which one study reported an insignificant cluster effect (<LINK REF="STD-Manne-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Manne 2009</LINK>). We contacted six authors of included studies, mainly for further clarification of data and to gather information on how the risks were personalised. Three authors responded.</P>

<P>The personalised risk communication formed components of a wide range of interventions, with some studies using multiple or combined interventions of varying complexity. In general, the interventions used educational counselling (oral), written material such as tailored print material, computer/web-based interventions, and decision aids. Many studies tailored the interventions using constructs from behaviour change theories. Several studies used more than one theoretical construct to base their interventions. The table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> provides further information on the interventions. With regard to the interventions targeted at patients, 19 studies reported on single component interventions and 22 reported on multiple component/complex interventions.

Ten studies had interventions that included a calculated numerical risk estimate, such as from the Gail model for breast cancer risk (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1989</LINK>). Seven studies had interventions that categorised risk level, such as into 'high&#8217;, 'medium&#8217; or 'low&#8217; strata.

<P>Informed decision</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three newly-identified studies reported informed decision as an outcome measure in their study (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steckelberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steckelberg 2011</LINK>).

</UL>
<P>Knowledge regarding the screening test</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nine studies reported knowledge as one of their outcome measures. Different scales were used, with four studies measuring knowledge as a continuous variable (<LINK REF="STD-Glazebrook-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glazebrook 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1997</LINK>). Five studies dichotomised this outcome, measuring the proportion of participants with adequate knowledge after the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steckelberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steckelberg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevena-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Trevena 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rimer 2002</LINK>).</LI>

<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2002</LINK>) reported perceiving self as an appropriate candidate for the test, and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rimer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 2002</LINK>) reported accurately perceived risk as outcome measures. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>) measured perceived risk as the perceived chance of developing the disease, which was not included in the meta-analysis.</LI>

<P>Several studies were considered closely for inclusion but were eventually excluded. We excluded 29 studies from this review. The primary reason for exclusion (14 studies) was that the intervention did not involve a personalised estimate of the participant's risk. Six studies designed the intervention around participants' health beliefs rather than their risks, and we excluded four studies for not containing a control group. Of the remaining five studies, one was a longitudinal study rather than a randomised trial, one was a study protocol, and in three studies, the outcome could not be regarded as a screening test.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Informed decision</HEADING>
<P>Our primary outcome of interest was 'informed decision'. This was measured in three newly-included studies, with the measures based on Marteau&#8217;s Multidimensional Measure of Informed choice (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2001</LINK>). One study provided personalised risk to the consumers undergoing screening, within interventions that used a calculated risk score (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>). The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Steckelberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steckelberg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>) listed out the personal risk factors to the participants. Overall there is strong evidence from these three trials that personalised risk communication, when presented as a part of complex interventions such as decision aids, promotes informed uptake of screening tests. Overall 45.2% (592/1309) of participants who received personalised risk information made informed choices, compared to 20.2% (229/1135) of participants who received generic risk information. The odds ratio (OR) for the study that provided numerical risk in its intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>) was OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.14 to 3.81). The pooled OR for the two studies that used listing of risk factors in their intervention was 4.98 (95% CI 3.97 to 6.24). The overall ORs were 4.48 (95% CI 3.62 to 5.53) for fixed-effect and 3.65 (95% CI 2.13 to 6.23) for random-effects. The effect measures showed significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%), probably due to differences in the type of interventions and the populations within each study. However all studies consistently demonstrated a similar direction of effect, favouring personalised risk communication (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

The scales used varied with studies and we present these as standardised mean differences (SMDs). There were considerable subgroup differences, but all studies showed a significant increase in knowledge with personalised risk communication. We present the SMDs (by fixed-effects model) in each subgroup below in the table (also see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> subcategories 1-3 and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>):</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk perception/comprehension</HEADING>
<P>In three studies the interventions showed a trend towards more accurate risk perception (fixed-effect OR 1.46 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.88); random-effects OR 1.65 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.81), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> ). However the evidence from these studies was of low quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2002</LINK>) examined whether people perceived themselves as appropriate for the tests after the intervention, with a non-significant trend towards fewer people perceiving appropriateness of tests after the intervention(see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 2002</LINK> studied the effect of tailored print material on the decision to take up genetic screening in women with personal history of breast and ovarian cancer. This study showed that women were more knowledgeable (SMD 0.57 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.82)), and had more accurate perceptions of risk (OR 2.50 (95% CI 1.48 to 4.20)), but fewer intended to take tests after the personalised risk intervention (OR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.64)), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1995</LINK> reported a small (non-significant) improvement in risk comprehension after personalised risks were delivered (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Anxiety</HEADING>
<P>Four out of six studies reported non-significant changes in anxiety following personalised risk communication to the participants. Overall there was a small, non-significant decrease in anxiety scores in the intervention group (fixed-effect SMD -0.13 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.03); random-effects SMD -0.13 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.03); negative values indicate a decrease in anxiety and favouring personalised risk communication), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Uptake of test</HEADING>
<P>Most studies (32/41) measured the uptake of screening tests following personalised risk communication interventions. There was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 80%) within these studies. Subgroup analysis revealed this was less significant when studies were examined by the levels of risk communication that was provided within their interventions. Heterogeneity was least significant in studies where risk was provided in a more detailed manner, i.e. as a numerical score. There were six studies in this group, with personalised risk communication having little effect on the uptake of screening tests (fixed-effect OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.15)), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> subcategory 01 and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). For risk estimates or calculations which were categorised into high, medium or low strata of risk (six studies), the results were significant ( OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.51) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> subcategory 02 and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Overall, pooling of these two subgroups yielded a combined OR of 1.15 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.29) &#8211; indicative of weak evidence, consistent with a small effect, that personalised risk communication where a risk score was provided or the participants were given their categorised risk, increases uptake of screening tests. </P>
<P>For studies that listed personal risk factors in their interventions (20 studies), there was considerable heterogeneity between studies for uptake of test, and we do not present a pooled estimate for this subgroup. However 10/20 studies (50%) showed a significant increase in the uptake of the screening tests following personalised risk communication interventions (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> subcategory 01). </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 1998</LINK>) also assessed 'appropriate uptake' of tests (externally-defined appropriateness: that is, uptake for people at higher risk, and non-uptake for people at lower risk) and found more appropriate uptake after the personalised risk intervention (OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.55) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intention to take up screening test</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies measured the intention to take screening tests, and had considerably heterogeneous results (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Three other studies measured the intention to take up genetic testing in normal or low risk participants. These tests (as discussed earlier in this review) are not necessarily indicated in consumers with such low or average risks. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2002</LINK>) the results were inconclusive (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2010</LINK>) demonstrated a significant decrease in participants' intentions to take up the genetic tests following personalised risk communication interventions. The mean difference (MD) for fixed-effect was -0.53 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.44) and for random-effects was -0.77 (95% CI -1.42 to -0.13) (negative values indicate a decrease in intention and favour personalised risk communication; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

However, the combination of tailored telephone and print interventions (versus usual care) had the largest effect (OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.81)). <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2008</LINK> found that the forward movement of stage was slightly higher in the risk tailored group for colorectal cancer screening. <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1994</LINK> found that 71% of participants did not change; 14% advanced one stage; 12% 'regressed'; no significant differences between tailored message and control groups were noticed (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>).</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2010</LINK>) measured quality of life scores on the SF-36 scale after interventions to promote breast health behaviours. There was significant improvement on this measure following personalised risk communication(MD 7.10 (95% CI 5.90 to 8.30), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>The results for the studies addressing mammography showed similar effects with uptake of screening and to the overall data set. The numerical calculated risk estimates were associated with lower ORs for uptake of tests (OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.03)) (See <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK> and subcategories). The subgroups for categorised risk and listing of risk factors showed considerable heterogeneity with uptake of the tests and it was not appropriate to pool these results (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 11 studies examining risk communication in high-risk individuals showed trends towards larger ORs for uptake of tests than the other studies. The OR for numerical estimates of risk was 1.05 by fixed-effect (95% CI 0.79 to 1.40) and 1.08 by random-effects (95% CI 0.63 to 1.84). The OR for categorised estimates of risk was 1.38 (95%CI 1.06 to1.80). Overall, pooling of these two subgroups yielded a combined OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.48),  indicative of a higher uptake of screening tests when only the high-risk group studies were analysed (<LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>For studies whose interventions listed personal risk factors, there was considerable heterogeneity between studies for uptake of test, and we do not present a pooled estimate for this subgroup (See <LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten studies measured uptake of tests in colorectal cancer screening programmes. The overall OR for uptake was 1.02 by fixed-effect (95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and 1.06 by random-effects (95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) (see <LINK REF="CMP-006.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.8</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the uptake of screening tests, by excluding studies that were either at either unclear or high risk of bias for four risk of bias domains that we considered to be most important for this topic. The results were as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>In this analysis we included only low risk studies. The analysis for this risk of bias domain yielded a lower uptake of tests, with an OR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.39) when the two groups with limited heterogeneity (i.e. those which provided either numerical or categorised risks) were pooled. Five low risk studies accounted for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bodurtha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bodurtha 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazebrook-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glazebrook 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevena-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Trevena 2008</LINK>). The studies that provided listing of risk factors remained considerably heterogeneous, even after studies with high risk of bias for the above domain were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data (attrition)</HEADING>
<P>In this analysis we included only low risk studies. The analysis for this risk of bias domain yielded similar uptake of tests, with an OR of 1.15 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.35) when the two groups with limited heterogeneity (i.e. those which provided either numerical or categorised risks) were pooled. Nine low risk studies accounted for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bodurtha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bodurtha 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glanz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Glanz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sequist-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sequist 2011</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Trevena-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Trevena 2008</LINK>). The studies that provided listing of risk factors remained considerably heterogeneous, even after studies with high risk of bias for the above domain were excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective reporting (reporting bias)</B>
</P>
<P>In this analysis we only excluded studies that were at high risk for selective reporting. We included low risk studies and the 'unclear' studies which reported all outcomes mentioned in their methods sections, but were marked 'unclear' due to unavailability of study protocol. The analysis for this risk of bias domain reduced the uptake of tests, with an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.18) when the two groups with limited heterogeneity (i.e. those which provided either numerical or categorised risks) were pooled. Seven studies accounted for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bastani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bastani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bodurtha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bodurtha 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glanz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Glanz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rimer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sequist-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sequist 2011</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Baseline comparability</HEADING>
<P>The analysis for this risk of bias domain again yielded a similar measure of uptake of tests, with an OR of 1.15 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.33) for fixed-effect and 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.57) for random-effects model (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63%), when the two groups with limited heterogeneity (i.e. those which provided either numerical or categorised risks) were pooled. Eight studies accounted for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bodurtha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bodurtha 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glanz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Glanz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glazebrook-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glazebrook 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rimer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sequist-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sequist 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevena-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Trevena 2008</LINK>). The studies that provided listing of risk factors remained considerably heterogeneous, even after studies with high risk of bias for the above domain were excluded.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analyses for selection bias, attrition bias and baseline comparability did not alter the uptake measure significantly. By excluding the studies that had a high risk for selective reporting bias, the OR for uptake was lower, probably due to the exclusion of studies that may have reported only significant results.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-23 20:03:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates the second (2006) publication of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2006</LINK>).  Risk communication, particularly in the field of screening, is evolving with time. We have identified 19 new studies with elements of personalised risk communication in screening, which takes the total number of studies in this review to 41. The earlier two versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2006</LINK>) included studies that measured outcomes that form elements of an informed decision, but identified no studies measuring informed decision as such. This updated review includes three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steckelberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steckelberg 2011</LINK>) that specifically have measured informed decision for the uptake of screening tests after personalised risk communication. From these three studies, there was strong evidence that personalised risk communication enhanced informed decision making, although with heterogeneous results. We expected this heterogeneity due to the varied nature of the interventions and the level of risk communication that was used in each of these studies. However, all studies had significant effect sizes, all favouring personalised risk communication.</P>
<P>Other recent studies have sought to address knowledge, perceived risk, and other elements of informed decision making. Overall these studies showed an increase in knowledge and a trend towards more accurate risk perception when personalised risk was included in their interventions. This field of risk communication in screening mirrors other clinical areas of health care, where there is an increasing trend to involve consumers in their own healthcare choices. In the same way that screening recommendations have developed in recent years from simply seeking to maximise uptake, to promotion of informed choice about participation in screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2005</LINK>), the trial literature also now shows some development towards this.</P>
<P>Further, there was weak evidence to suggest that such interventions promote uptake of screening tests, although effects were small.</P>
<P>Some data also show that when the personalised risk information disclosed is more detailed, the uptake of tests is lower than when the risk communication is less detailed or numerically unspecific (i.e. when categorised into risk groups). Significant heterogeneity was noted among studies that merely listed the personal risk factors in their intervention. Test uptake thus becomes unpredictable when less specific ways of communicating personal risk factors are used. This may reflect the differences in perception of actual risk among participants between studies when such less specific methods of personalised risk communication are employed, but may also reflect the different nature of screening programme where some are more controversial (e.g. mammography and PSA testing) that the others (e.g. colorectal cancer screening).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">High risk status an effect modifier</HEADING>
<P>The effects of interventions on screening uptake appeared greater among consumers or patients deemed to be at higher risk of a disease than average. In this group of studies, most favoured the intervention, irrespective of the level of risk communication. This suggests that the 'high risk status' of the consumer may be an important effect modifier for personalised risk communication. There appears to be potential for substantial modification of choices made among this group of consumers. It may be appropriate that the scope for interventions to influence decisions is large in this group of consumers. Equally, however, interventions could be harmful if they are not introduced carefully. Healthcare professionals must take steps to ensure that they are achieving informed decision making by these consumers.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-20 03:15:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have used a highly-sensitive search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1999</LINK>) to identify as many papers as possible in this field, from all relevant databases. The search covers studies published until March 2012, in an effort to outline the most contemporary evidence at the time of publication. To further increase the completeness of this search, we have followed this up by handsearching journals and reference lists, and also have looked at other similar reviews in the field to identify any papers missed in the initial search. This updated review presents a significant increase in the number of included studies, compared to the previous versions. Notably, however, the interventions used in these studies cover a range of methods to deliver the personalised element of risk communication.  In addition, the measures of components of informed decision vary widely across studies. The settings in which the studies were conducted include a diverse range of screening programmes. Therefore, data from this review do not allow us to draw a firm conclusion about the best interventions to deliver personalised risk st= in enhancing informed decisions. The results are dominated by findings from the topic area of mammography and colorectal cancer. Caution is therefore required in generalising from these results, particularly for clinical topics other than mammography and colorectal cancer screening.</P>
<P>Further, in all studies the effects are a measure of the ('complex') intervention as a whole rather than that of personalised risk communication per se. However, isolating the effect of personalised risk communication on informed decisions or the uptake of tests, and drawing firm conclusions based on this, poses a great challenge to researchers working in this field.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-23 20:03:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 41 studies in this review. It is difficult to draw general conclusions from this review because these studies varied widely according to interventions provided, outcomes measured, the screening programme, and duration of interventions and follow-up. A substantial number of people are included in this review (28,700), and the number of participants within each study varied widely, from 140 to 3152 people.</P>
<P>The studies that reported direct measures of informed decision were few (n = 3) in number, but were of very good methodological quality. Most other studies that measured other outcomes (i.e. components of informed decision) were not explicit in reporting elements that could introduce biases into their design, although studies reporting several of the knowledge outcomes were also of high quality. Only five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2010</LINK>) provided information of the validity of scales used to measure the outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>We have illustrated the quality of evidence for our main outcomes using GRADE Working Group recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Overall, the outcome &#8216;informed decision&#8217; and several of the knowledge outcomes were subject to less risk of bias and provide better quality of evidence than the other reported outcomes (in particular, screening uptake, accuracy of perceived risk, and anxiety). </P>

<P>Despite the extensive search strategy, we may have missed some studies of interventions including personalised risk communication for screening tests if they were not indexed in the bibliographic databases appropriately to be identified by our search terms. We made significant efforts to contact trial authors for further data, where these were not available, and for further details of how the risks were personalised. Some data that were not extractable or were unclear were not included, if we did not receive further clarification from the authors.</P>
<P>As expected, the other main limitation of this review lies in the fact that we did not find any studies that examined the effect of personalised risk communication in isolation. All studies studied the effect of their interventions which included personalised risk communication. The interventions as such were diverse in nature, and it is hard to draw firm conclusions on the weight of effect that personalised risk communication has contributed to. There was considerable heterogeneity in some of the groups, in which case we did not pool these data. Many studies that were unclear on the risk of bias items are still included within the overall meta-analyses, and we present a sensitivity analysis by excluding such studies. Lastly, ways to measure the outcomes were also diverse which may have biased the review. Common validated methods of measuring informed decision are yet to be developed for wider use.</P>

<P>We are not aware of any other systematic reviews that assessed specifically the effect of personalised risk communication on measures of informed decision. <LINK REF="REF-Albada-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albada 2009</LINK> was the most similar review assessing the effects of tailored information based on theoretical (behavioural) constructs and providing cancer risk for individuals undergoing screening. The authors assessed the effects on risk perception, knowledge and screening behaviour. They concluded that interventions based on theoretical constructs increased risk perception and knowledge of cancer as compared to generic interventions, and information tailored to individual risk specifically increased realistic risk perceptions. As with our review, they found limited evidence for enhancing screening behaviour. A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2011</LINK>) also found that decision aids that are tailored to support individual healthcare decisions increased people's involvement, and improved knowledge and realistic perception of outcomes, but had variable effect on choice behaviour.</P>
<P>Noar et al presented the first meta-analytic review of tailored print interventions for health behaviour change. In contrast with our review, their findings suggest that tailored print information focusing on preventive health behaviours out-perform generic interventions. However a host of behaviour change studies other than screening are included in their review (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Briss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 2004</LINK> studied interventions that were generally consistent in improving individuals&#8217; knowledge about the disease, accuracy of risk perceptions, or knowledge and beliefs about the pros and cons of screening and treatment options. They reported insufficient evidence that such interventions promote informed decisions, due to a paucity of studies that fully measured this outcome. They recommended further research in this area, providing a conceptual framework to evaluate this outcome. We have found only three studies that used informed decision as an outcome measure, reiterating the recommendations proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Briss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briss 2004</LINK>.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:43:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:42:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is strong evidence, from three trials, that personalised risk estimates incorporated within communication interventions for screening programmes enhance informed choice. However the evidence for similar interventions increasing the uptake of such screening tests is weak and it is not clear if this increase is associated with informed choice. Focusing on the achievement and demonstration of informed choice in isolation, would, nonetheless, fail to address the wider context. This context concerns an apparent tension between public health and individual health policy. Policies of greater patient involvement in decisions are being pursued, and this is justified from both ethical perspectives and some (though perhaps more limited) evidence of improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Guadagnoli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guadagnoli 1998</LINK>). There is a need to evaluate whether such policies mean that those people invited for screening are genuinely making informed choices, and how comprehensive information affects other variables such as uptake, cost effectiveness, and satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2005</LINK>). Appropriate risk communication has an integral role in this (<LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2000</LINK>). But as this is followed through, it is possible that public health objectives might be compromised.</P>
<P>An example may be seen in breast cancer screening.  Younger women are at lower risk of developing cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2009</LINK>), but may perceive themselves as at higher risk due to screening activity, publicity and public health messages about the importance of screening for the population.  Some women may choose not to have regular screening when informed of the absolute levels of risk and benefit from screening programmes. But the public health message, aided sometimes by financial incentives for clinicians to achieve high uptake figures, means that informed decision making by patients is still a major challenge (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2005</LINK>). Further, recent literature demonstrates uncertainties surrounding actual estimates of risks and benefits associated with breast cancer screening.  <LINK REF="REF-McPherson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPherson 2010</LINK> analyses such evidence in a recent article, concluding "Arguments that polarise are unhelpful and render women, many with strong preferences, more helpless (to make informed decisions). For too long they have been misled and confused by too much agenda driven analyses of these data. What is required now is a full examination of all the data, preferably individual patient data, from all the recent studies, by dispassionate epidemiologists to get the best estimates in the UK screening setting.&#8221;</P>
<P>The same tension exists in relation to cardiovascular screening (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2002</LINK>). These tensions between public health goals and individual choices must be recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2002</LINK>). An informed debate should be conducted among the relevant interest groups - government, public health, clinicians, and particularly patients and patient representative groups. There are some signs that this debate is now taking place (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stefanek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefanek 2011</LINK>). Policy developments could explore whether individually appropriate choices, which vary from those recommended by standards and guidelines, can be accommodated in assessments of achieving best practice (i.e. meeting standards) at population level. One solution may be for care to be viewed as 'adherent to guidelines' or 'satisfactory' if adequate steps have been made to achieve and demonstrate informed decision making by patients - even if it deviates from the conventional (bio-medical) recommendations of those guidelines. However it is also important to consider ethical implications whilst trying to achieve informed choice specially in certain disadvantaged populations. The question is whether this deters such individuals from undergoing the immediate inconveniences of screening, especially if the diagnosis necessitates a change in their behaviour or lifestyle and thus potentially widening the inequities in healthcare provision. Kellar and colleagues in their study conclude that in such circumstances efforts to enhance informed choice may require that the immediate benefits are communicated, and efforts to address the apparent barriers are made, if the potential for inequity is to be avoided (<LINK REF="REF-Kellar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellar 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Taking the example of cervical cancer screening, a full discussion of the pros and cons of screening for cervical cancer may be viewed as a satisfactory goal for the healthcare provider, even if an individual woman chooses not to undergo screening, thus against public health advice. Counting such scenarios as satisfactory or adherent to guidelines (for example for purposes of audit) may allow healthcare professionals to enhance their communication with patients. If this is incorporated into the goals of health care, then improvements in care can be achieved without falling foul of requirements for governance, audit, and payment targets. An example was evident in the criteria for Fellowship by Assessment (FBA) of the Royal College of General Practitioners (UK). In the case of vaccination targets, the criteria stated that "candidates who are unable to demonstrate these standards must exceed the average level of vaccination and show how patients/ parents/ care givers are enabled to make an informed choice about vaccination" (<LINK REF="REF-RCGP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCGP 2002</LINK>). The FBA scheme has now been revised, but the issue of informed decision making in preventive activities could equally apply to screening choices. The need for measures to demonstrate informed choice across a number of healthcare decisions is further reiterated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-08 06:43:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In future, studies that use standardised and validated measures of informed decision are needed. Further, studies designed to measure the effect of personalised risk communication more accurately still need to be developed. We discuss three main areas in which research should be focused in risk communication for screening:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Calculating risk scores</HEADING>
<P>The relative paucity of data in the screening area reflects the difficulties for researchers or clinicians in communicating personalised risk to consumers. The range of clinical topics for which risk scores in specified populations are available is narrow. Calculation or estimation of risk is dependent on adequate epidemiological background data, and feasible means of converting these into information for consumers based on their individual risk factors. Examples include the Gail model (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1989</LINK>) and methods for calculating cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hippisley_x002d_Cox-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippisley-Cox 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heart 1999</LINK>), but only the latter has permeated into routine clinical practice. In some cases, risk scores can only be calculated after the screening test - an example is the FRAX<SUP>®</SUP> score (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2009</LINK>) used to calculate risk of osteoporotic fractures. In clinical practice patients are offered screening if they have known risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Currently treatment recommendations are not exclusively based on FRAX<SUP>®</SUP> assessment scores. This remains a matter of clinical judgement. However the scores can provide patients with a personalised estimate of the risk of sustaining an osteoporotic fracture, and help them make informed decisions about adopting preventive measures or starting prophylactic medications. There is a need for equivalent epidemiological research into an extended range of clinical topics. This could provide a basis for models that allow calculation of personalised risk estimates for individuals about other conditions, such as cervical, prostate or colorectal cancer. Then further evaluation of the effects of providing such personalised risk information to consumers would be possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presenting risk information</HEADING>
<P>Further challenges for clinicians arise from limitations in the available literature. Despite the large body of evidence, there seems to be a lack of consensus concerning the most appropriate method with which to communicate medical risk (<LINK REF="REF-Ghosh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghosh 2005</LINK>). Lipkus states that the available evidence has yet to suggest a best practice approach. Reasons for this are the lack of consistency in testing communication formats using the same outcome measure, the relative lack of randomised controlled trials, and the lack of emphasis on developing communication strategies that are built upon a solid theoretical background (<LINK REF="REF-Lipkus-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipkus 2007a</LINK>). Of the studies that are available, very few have used shared decision making or informed decision making as the outcome measure. Most studies look at risk perception, knowledge, or understanding and these may not be the most appropriate measures of effective risk communication. Future research must address this in an attempt to involve patients in decision making, promoting informed choices in health care in general and in screening in particular.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Demonstrating informed choices</HEADING>
<P>There may also be an onus on clinicians to demonstrate this informed decision making with evidence. Further research is required into how such informed decision making by consumers can be demonstrated validly. There are some outcome measures in this field such as the multi-dimensional measure of informed choice in Down's syndrome screening (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2001</LINK>). This is based on assessing the consistency between knowledge, attitudes to tests and choices of uptake of tests. This measure is specific to Down's screening at present. Further research should explore the development of measures for other screening choices, or whether a generic measure of informed choice for screening decisions is feasible. This would require more general cognitive measures than the condition-specific knowledge items. Other scales currently available offer the scope to derive such a cognitive component for a generic measure (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2003a</LINK>) but at the present time, there is no validated measure of informed choice in cancer screening (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2005</LINK>). There would be value in developing a generic measure of informed decision making for screening choices by consumers. Using such a measure widely would also be important in assessing the true effect of personalised risk communication on people's use of screening tests.</P>

We expected heterogeneity of the studies in terms of the screening tests addressed, participants, and design of the intervention. We used a fixed-effect model to present pooled data where heterogeneity was of low or moderate significance i.e. I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 60%. Results from a random-effects model (which gives a more conservative confidence interval on the estimate of effect size) were examined and presented in cases (in addition to fixed-effect estimates) where there was heterogeneity of substantial significance i.e. I<SUP>2</SUP>= 60% to 79%.
