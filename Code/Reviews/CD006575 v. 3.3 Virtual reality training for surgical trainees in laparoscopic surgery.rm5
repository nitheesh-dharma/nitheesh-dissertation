<P>We revised the eligibility criteria and updated the methods according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.2, re-analysed the data, and revised conclusions.</P>
<P>The previous conclusions were "Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training. Further research of better methodological quality and more patient-relevant outcomes are needed". The conclusions in the current version are "Virtual reality training appears to decrease the operating time and improve the operative performance of surgical trainees with limited laparoscopic experience when compared with no training or with box-trainer training. However, the impact of this decreased operating time and improvement in operative performance on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs is not known. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the impact of virtual reality training on clinical outcomes".</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:22:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Standard surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform the surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is costly, time-consuming, and is of variable effectiveness. Laparoscopic surgery involves the use of instruments using keyhole and is generally considered more difficult than open surgery. Training using a virtual reality simulator (computer simulation) is an option to supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training. Virtual reality training improves the technical skills of surgical trainees. The impact of virtual reality training in supplementing standard laparoscopic surgical training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience on patients is not known. We define surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience as those who have helped senior surgeons in laparoscopic operations and would need supervision for performing laparoscopic operations on their own. We sought to answer the question of whether virtual reality training is useful for such surgical trainees in terms of improving surgical results and for improving the operative performance by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised clinical trials. Randomised clinical trials are commonly called randomised controlled trials and are the best study design to answer such questions. If conducted well, they provide the most accurate answer.</P>
<P>Two authors searched the medical literature available until July 2012 and obtained the information from the identified trials. The use of two authors to identify studies and obtain information decreases the errors in obtaining the information. We identified and included eight trials covering 109 surgical trainees in this review. The trials compared virtual reality with no supplementary training or with box-trainer training (physical simulator using a camera to display the inside of the box and instruments). There were no trials that compared different forms of virtual reality training. All the trials were at high risk of bias (defects in study design that can lead to arriving at wrong conclusions with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms of virtual reality training or standard training). Operating time and operative performance were the only outcomes reported in the trials. The remaining outcomes such as death, complications, quality of life, and hospital stay after the operation were not reported in any of the trials. Overall virtual reality training appears to decrease the operating time (by about 10 minutes) and improve the operative performance of surgical trainees (difficult to quantify from the available reports) with limited laparoscopic experience when compared with no supplementary training or with box-trainer training. However, the impact of this decreased operating time and improvement in operative performance on patients or healthcare funders in terms of improved health or decreased costs is not known. Further well-designed trials are necessary, with less risk of arriving at wrong conclusions because of poor study design or because of chance. Such trials should assess the impact of virtual reality training on patients and healthcare funders.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-15 19:37:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality training versus other forms of training including box-trainer training, no training, or standard laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with little laparoscopic experience. We also planned to include trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training. We included only trials that assessed the outcomes in people undergoing laparoscopic surgery.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 19:37:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Two authors independently identified trials and collected data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:21:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We included eight trials covering 109 surgical trainees with limited laparoscopic experience. Of the eight trials, six compared virtual reality versus no supplementary training. One trial compared virtual reality training versus box-trainer training and versus no supplementary training, and one trial compared virtual reality training versus box-trainer training. There were no trials that compared different forms of virtual reality training. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Operating time and operative performance were the only outcomes reported in the trials. The remaining outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, quality of life (the primary outcomes of this review) and hospital stay (a secondary outcome) were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Virtual reality training versus no supplementary training:</B> The operating time was significantly shorter in the virtual reality group than in the no supplementary training group (3 trials; 49 participants; MD -11.76 minutes; 95% CI -15.23 to -8.30). Two trials that could not be included in the meta-analysis also showed a reduction in operating time (statistically significant in one trial). The numerical values for operating time were not reported in these two trials. The operative performance was significantly better in the virtual reality group than the no supplementary training group using the fixed-effect model (2 trials; 33 participants; SMD 1.65; 95% CI 0.72 to 2.58). The results became non-significant when the random-effects model was used (2 trials; 33 participants; SMD 2.14; 95% CI -1.29 to 5.57). One trial could not be included in the meta-analysis as it did not report the numerical values. The authors stated that the operative performance of virtual reality group was significantly better than the control group.</P>
<P>
<B>Virtual reality training versus box-trainer training:</B> The only trial that reported operating time did not report the numerical values. In this trial, the operating time in the virtual reality group was significantly shorter than in the box-trainer group. Of the two trials that reported operative performance, only one trial reported the numerical values. The operative performance was significantly better in the virtual reality group than in the box-trainer group (1 trial; 19 participants; SMD 1.46; 95% CI 0.42 to 2.50). In the other trial that did not report the numerical values, the authors stated that the operative performance in the virtual reality group was significantly better than the box-trainer group.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-16 14:58:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah Louise Klingenberg">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-16 14:58:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>Standard surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. Different procedures have different learning curves (<LINK REF="REF-Herrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekkis-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekkis 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekkis-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekkis 2005b</LINK>). Surgeons experienced in one procedure may not be experienced in another and results improve with experience in an individual procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Herrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekkis-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekkis 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekkis-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekkis 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>An increasing number of surgical procedures are being done laparoscopically (by abdominal keyhole surgery). This includes laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder), laparoscopic anti-reflux procedures (surgery for heartburn), laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of uterus), and laparoscopic nephrectomy (removal of kidney) (<LINK REF="REF-Ghezzi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghezzi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salminen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venkatesh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesh 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:22:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>The different methods of laparoscopic surgical training include live animal training, human and animal cadaver training, training using box-trainer (also called video trainer), and virtual reality training (training using computer simulation) (<LINK REF="REF-Munz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munz 2004</LINK>). Box trainers are currently being used for laparoscopic training in various courses run by the Royal College of Surgeons of England and have been shown to be superior to standard surgical training (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>). Virtual reality training has been reported to improve the learning outcomes in different surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Hyltander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyltander 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watterson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grantcharov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grantcharov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munz 2004</LINK>). It also offers an ethical way of assessing the competency of a surgeon in performing a procedure without risk to the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Moorthy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorthy 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:22:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>There are other reports that suggest that virtual reality training alone is inferior to traditional training for certain procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Gerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerson 2003</LINK>). Virtual reality training has been mainly used for development of technical skills and not training in decision-making skills. As opposed to the limited variability of data available during a flight on which a pilot requires to be trained using a custom-designed simulator, anatomical variations are common throughout the human body (<LINK REF="REF-Heloury-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heloury 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamah 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Izuishi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Izuishi 2005</LINK>), and skills acquired on a single computer simulation programme may not be applicable to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The price of the simulators can vary depending upon the learning outcome. However, traditional surgical training is not without costs. The operating time increases significantly for junior surgeons compared to senior surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Farnworth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farnworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Babineau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babineau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkiemeyer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkiemeyer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kauvar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kauvar 2006</LINK>). Bridges and Diamond report the average costs of this increased operating time to be about USD 12,000 per year per resident during the period 1993 to 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Bridges-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges 1999</LINK>). The complication rate is also higher for junior surgeons compared to senior surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkiemeyer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkiemeyer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kauvar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kauvar 2006</LINK>). Bridges and Diamond did not include the cost of the complications in their cost analysis. Thus, the additional cost of the virtual reality training system has to be balanced against the cost of increased operating time and complication rates during traditional surgical training.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:22:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>There have been previous reviews related to virtual reality training in surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Gaba-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006</LINK>). This review is an update of a review by this group (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). It was clear from the first review that virtual reality had the potential to supplement standard surgical training.</P>
<P>This updated review includes only trials of surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience and where the impact on patient outcomes was assessed. Real operations have the added complexity of anatomical variations (<LINK REF="REF-Heloury-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heloury 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamah 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Izuishi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Izuishi 2005</LINK>), decision-making skills (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>), and mental stress (<LINK REF="REF-Prabhu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhu 2010</LINK>). Considering that patient welfare is the main reason for surgical training, it is important to focus on operative performance in the real situation and its impact on patients rather than on improvement in technical skills during virtual reality training.</P>

<SUBSECTION>

<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (the method used was either adequate (eg, computer-generated random numbers, table of random numbers) or unlikely to introduce confounding).</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (the method used (eg, central allocation) was unlikely to introduce bias into the final observed effect).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias (there was insufficient information to assess whether the method used was likely to introduce bias into the estimate of effect).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (the method used (eg, open random allocation schedule) was likely to introduce bias into the final observed effect).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>In this situation, both the participants and personnel are the same, ie, the surgical trainees operate on the patients. It is impossible to blind the surgical trainees. We therefore consider this domain to be at high risk of bias for all trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessors</HEADING>
<P>Since it is not possible to blind the surgical trainee (participant), it is important that outcome assessors are different from the participants and have no knowledge about the group of the participant.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias (there is insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used was likely to introduce bias into the estimate of effect).</LI>

</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (the underlying reasons for missingness are unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods have been employed to handle missing data).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias (there was insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data was likely to introduce bias into the estimate of effect).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (the crude estimate of effects (eg, complete case estimate) was clearly biased due to the underlying reasons for missingness, and the methods used to handle missing data are unsatisfactory).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (the trial protocol is available and all of the trial's pre-specified outcomes that are of interest in the review had been reported or similar; if the trial protocol was not available, mortality and morbidity were reported).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias (there was insufficient information to assess whether the magnitude and direction of the observed effect was related to selective outcome reporting).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (not all of the trial's pre-specified primary outcomes had been reported or similar).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vested interest bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (the trial was not performed or supported by any parties that might have conflicting interest, eg, virtual reality trainer manufacturer).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias (any conflicts of interest of the trialist or trial funder was not clear).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (the trial was performed or supported by any parties that might have conflicting interest, eg, virtual reality trainer manufacturer).</LI>

<P>For binary outcomes, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk ratio calculations do not include trials in which no events occurred in either group, whereas risk difference calculations do. We planned to report the risk difference if the results using this association measure were different from risk ratio. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for outcomes such as operating time and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for quality of life and operative performance (where different scales might be used).</P>

There was no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0; Chi² test for heterogeneity P value = 0.75). There was no change in the results by using the fixed-effect or the random-effects model. The standard deviation was imputed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McClusky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McClusky 2004</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-20 14:47:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-20 14:47:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>Laparoscopic surgery is different from open surgery because of: increased need for hand-eye-co-ordination to perform tasks looking at a screen to compensate for not being able to operate under direct vision; increased need for manual dexterity to compensate for the use of long instruments, which can amplify any error in movement; fulcrum effect of the body wall, ie, when the surgeon moves his hand to the patient's right, the operating end of the instrument moves to the patient's left on the monitor (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 1999</LINK>); the need for handling tissues carefully (to compensate for the lack of sensation of touch using hands); and the lack of three-dimensional images. Virtual reality training is one of the many methods of laparoscopic surgical training and is currently aimed at improving psychomotor skills (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>An increasing number of procedures are being performed laparoscopically. With the decreasing time to train surgeons because of European Working Time Directive (<LINK REF="REF-Chikwe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chikwe 2004</LINK>) and modernising medical careers (MMC) initiative by the Department of Health (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2005</LINK>), training structured to improve surgical skills in the least time with maximum efficiency is necessary. This is applicable to surgical trainees with no prior experience in laparoscopic surgery and in those who have started their laparoscopic career but have not achieved proficiency. Because of the shortened working hours, the trainees may be exposed to fewer surgical procedures and hence may lack experience. Thus, it is necessary to develop generic skills, such as suturing or cutting and also procedure-specific skills, such as cannulating the common bile duct. In the previous version of this review, we demonstrated that virtual reality training improved generic skills such as suturing or cutting (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). In this update, we have focused on the effect of virtual reality training on operative performance.</P>
<P>Eight trials with 109 surgical trainees were included in this review. The training regimens included training in basic tasks such as cutting, suturing, transfer of objects, or diathermy in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grantcharov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grantcharov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClusky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McClusky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogle 2009</LINK>) whereas they included dissection in anatomical models in addition to basic tasks in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2009</LINK>). The details of training were not available in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sendag-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sendag 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessing the evidence, it appears that virtual reality training decreases the operating time compared with no supplementary training. However, the difference is approximately 10 minutes per procedure. Although a formal subgroup analysis was not performed, the decrease in operating time appears to be more pronounced in the trial in which the trainees were trained on anatomical models (in addition to basic tasks) (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2009</LINK>) compared to the trials in which the surgical trainees were trained only in basic tasks (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, it should be noted that only three trials reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Grantcharov-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grantcharov 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClusky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McClusky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2009</LINK>), and we cannot be certain that the difference observed in the magnitude of the effect was due to the difference in the training regimen. Irrespective of the reason for the difference in the magnitude of the effect, the difference in operating time is unlikely to benefit patients in a major way. Whether this difference will decrease the costs by increasing the number of procedures performed in the theatre list depends upon the type of procedures and the duration of the theatre list. Virtual reality training improves the operative performance compared with no supplementary training. As in the case of operating time, the magnitude of difference is greater in the trial in which the trainees were trained on anatomical models (in addition to basic tasks) compared to the trials in which the surgical trainees were trained only in basic tasks (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Again, we cannot be certain that the difference observed in the magnitude of the effect was due to the difference in the training regimen as this outcome was reported by two trials only (<LINK REF="STD-Hogle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2009</LINK>). There is considerable uncertainty as to the magnitude of the improvement and what this improvement means to the patient and to the healthcare funder. One would generally equate better operative performance with better patient outcomes. However, there is currently no evidence to demonstrate the correlation between better operative performance and better patient outcomes. The likely reason for this is the sensitivity of the issue. Another reason may be that the performance can change (either improve because of more meticulous surgery or decrease because of the stress of the assessment) when a formal assessment is made, which makes the issue quite a difficult one to prove. However, if we agree to the common logical notion that patient outcomes are likely to be better if the operative performance improves, virtual reality training may improve patient outcomes by improving operative performance. While the longevity of this difference in operative performance between virtual reality-trained surgeons and those with no supplementary training is an unknown quantity, as the surgeons with no supplementary training may catch up with their virtual reality-trained counterparts as they gain more surgical experience, the difference during the learning curve in surgical training may benefit patients.</P>
<P>The version of the software used was reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlberg 2007</LINK>). It was therefore not possible to determine whether the magnitude of effect was greater with later versions of the software compared to the earlier versions. Because of the limited number of trials, it was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis based on the levels of experience of the surgical trainees, so it was not possible to determine whether the magnitude of effect was greater in surgical trainees with higher number of procedures performed under supervision.</P>
<P>Virtual reality training also appears to decrease the operating time and improve the operative performance when compared with box-trainer training. Again the magnitude and the impact of these differences between virtual reality training and box-trainer training is not known. In the United Kingdom, training is largely based on box-trainers (rather than virtual reality trainers) in addition to the standard laparoscopic training model of apprenticeships. A survey of satisfaction of the trainees in the virtual reality group and box-trainer group (<LINK REF="REF-Madan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madan 2005</LINK>) found that the majority of the trainees preferred box-trainers to virtual reality trainer and a significant number felt that the virtual reality training model was not realistic. This study did not have a haptic feedback interface. Haptic feedback is a tactile feedback technology which mimics the sense of touch by applying forces or vibrations to the user. None of the trials included in this review employed a haptic feedback facility. In the next few years, haptic feedback is likely to form an integral part of the virtual reality simulator and it is likely that the trainee satisfaction will increase with the better simulation. However, the degree of fidelity or realism does not alter the effectiveness in training (<LINK REF="REF-Grober-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grober 2004</LINK>). This might explain the reason for the effectiveness of virtual reality training in spite of being a low-fidelity model. However, improving the fidelity may increase trainee satisfaction and the enthusiasm to learn on virtual reality models.</P>
<P>Some potential advantages of virtual reality over box-trainer trainer include:<BR/>1. Two-handed tasks need to be followed closely using a second person for training. In virtual reality trainers which follow the instrument tips, there is no need for the second person. In box-trainers with a fixed video camera, a distance has to be chosen so that the task can be viewed closely. The introduction of instruments cannot be followed. This violates the rule of keeping the business end of the instrument under vision always, which is particularly important in those who are beginning their laparoscopic career.<BR/>2. One of the other major problems with box-trainer training is the 'trainer' time. An expert is necessary for evaluation and feedback in box trainer training. In virtual reality training, the computer evaluates every movement of the trainee and provides feedback after completion of the task (eg, reports the number of movements, distance moved by each hand, traces the path of movements, etc). These can even be used for monitoring the improvement in skills. Thus, the virtual reality software can act as a 'virtual tutor' and a regular training session every week is feasible. However, this advantage of a virtual reality trainer over a box-trainer has been questioned by some since it is not easy, even for experts, to distinguish reliably that a task was completed without problems (<LINK REF="REF-Greco-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greco 2010</LINK>). So if experts cannot come to an agreement about successful completion of a task, it is not possible to program this into a virtual reality trainer in order to determine whether the task was completed without problems.</P>
<P>The potential advantages of box-trainer training over virtual reality training include:<BR/>1. Cheaper cost of the model which enables training multiple trainees simultaneously in short training courses.<BR/>2. Better realism (use of real tissue and presence of haptic feedback) compared to currently evaluated virtual reality models (<LINK REF="REF-Madan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recent hybrid simulators with camera trackers to follow the instruments (<LINK REF="REF-Botden-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botden 2007</LINK>) combine some of the advantages of virtual reality training and box-trainer training. Further research is needed into whether such hybrid simulators are better than virtual reality trainers.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Recent advances in virtual reality technology has made it possible to import images into virtual reality software from external sources (<LINK REF="REF-Jaselskis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaselskis 2013</LINK>). It is possible to reconstruct the three-dimensional images if the x, y, z co-ordinates and colour information of each pixel is available (<LINK REF="REF-Cyberware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cyberware 2013</LINK>). In the near future, it might be possible to import these three-dimensional images into the virtual reality software. Once these images are imported into the virtual reality software, it should be possible to manipulate the images. That would mean that it is possible to train the surgical trainees in three-dimensional reconstructions of actual patients rather than train in their component skills only. Training on numerous such models with anatomic variations can also help with the improvement of decision-making skills and procedure-specific skills.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-16 12:25:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>The results of this review are applicable only to surgical trainees with limited laparoscopic experience and confine to the types of virtual reality training used in the trials. The evidence only shows that the operating time is decreased and the operative performance is increased by virtual reality training when compared with no supplementary training or with box-trainer training. There is currently no evidence that virtual reality training improved patient outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-08-20 13:47:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>All the trials were at high risk of bias. While blinding of outcome assessors was performed in three of the four trials that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hogle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2009</LINK>), the lack of blinding of the participants can result in bias. However, very few of the trials were able to provide data for our meta-analyses, which were based on few participants. Accordingly, we cannot exclude random errors. Overall the quality of evidence is very low as indicated in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Nevertheless, this is the best evidence that is currently available.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-15 19:47:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Myura Nagendran">
<P>Although study selection and data collection were performed in a non-blinded manner, the potential for bias and errors is largely reduced by the use of two independent data extractors. We were unable to assess publication bias by funnel plot but went through the trial registers to identify the trials. Thus there is unlikely to be publication bias but there appears to be evidence of reporting bias since many of the trials did not report the common outcomes that are likely to be measured during the conduct of the trial. The inclusion of data from such trials may result in a change in conclusions. We imputed the standard deviation when it was not available from the studies. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the impact of such imputation was low. The alternative was to exclude the information from the trial which would have made the interpretation of data even more difficult.</P>

<P>The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>) found that virtual reality training could supplement the standard laparoscopic surgical training model of apprenticeship, and was at least as effective as box trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training. Most reviews on this topic including the ones mentioned in the Background section arrive at similar conclusions.</P>

<P>The LapMentor&#8482; virtual reality surgical simulator shall be used for training the intervention group in laparoscopic technical skills, under the guise of an evidence-based training curriculum.<BR/>
<BR/>The training arm will undergo a training curriculum. This will be in 3 phases, ie:<BR/>1. Knowledge - a structured knowledge-based online training and assessment tool (including text, diagrams and video).<BR/>2. Technical Skills - a step-wise, structured and proficiency-based virtual reality training curriculum (incorporating technical skills, procedural tasks and full procedures).<BR/>3. Attitudes - a 1-day session in the simulated Operating Room to perform 2 complete laparoscopic cases with a full operative team. This will be scheduled in the simulated operating room.<BR/>
<BR/>The control arm will not undergo any of the above.<BR/>
