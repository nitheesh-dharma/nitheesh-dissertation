<DESCRIPTION>
<P>A search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register identified a single additional reference to an already excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1992</LINK>). Searches of ongoing trials registries identified two trials which were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00004315" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00004315</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00004441" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00004441</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials were previously listed as '<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>' pending further information from the authors which we have not been able to access (<LINK REF="STD-Kapustina-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kapustina 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spray-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Spray 2000</LINK>). Two of these trials have never been published as full papers and the abstracts do not contain sufficient details for us to confirm they meet the inclusion criteria; given the age of the abstracts, it is unlikely that any further publications relating to these trials will be forthcoming and they have therefore been excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Kapustina-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kapustina 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spray-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Spray 2000</LINK>). The third trial is cross-over in design but it is unclear whether there was any washout period employed and data are not published for the first six-month period of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>). We have added the study to the list of included trials, but have not been able to present any results as we are unable to extract appropriate data to analyse.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-01 14:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does ursodeoxycholic acid improve measures of liver function, reduce the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improve outcomes in general in people with cystic fibrosis?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Problems with the consistency of bile (thickened) and how it flows cause liver disease in up to 20% of young people with cystic fibrosis. Bile ducts can become blocked and cause cirrhosis in one or more parts of the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring bile acid which is taken as either a tablet or liquid to try and prevent liver disease in people with cystic fibrosis. The best response seems to be from a total dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two to three separate doses and given initially for several months but possibly indefinitely. Originally it was used to treat gallstones, but over the last few years it has been used to treat and prevent the progression of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease. This is an updated version of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We last searched for evidence on 09 April 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials of ursodeoxycholic acid lasting for at least three months and were able to include four trials, but data for analysis were only available from three of these. There are data from 118 participants aged between four and 32 years in this review. The dose of the drug given in the three trials with data ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. Two of these trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid to tablets with no medicine in them (placebo) and the third trial compared ursodeoxycholic acid to 'usual' treatment. The complex design of two trials meant data could not be analysed for all the participants. The trials lasted for up to 12 months, but no longer; however, one trial did report some follow-up data after nine years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Not many of the outcomes we listed in our review were assessed; only weight gain, skinfold thickness and biliary excretion. There were no real differences between treatments for any of these outcomes. Long-term outcomes that we think are important, such as death or the need for liver transplant, were only reported in the follow-up of one trial and the information did not tell us if the people who died or needed a liver transplant had received ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo.</P>
<P>Current research shows that side effects of this treatment are rare, but there is not enough information about using it in the long-term to justify routinely giving it to people with cystic fibrosis. As there is no other treatment to prevent liver disease, more research on ursodeoxycholic acid is needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The trials seemed to be well organised and well run, but there was not always enough information to judge them properly. While, on the whole, we do not think that any factors linked to how the trials were run would influence the results greatly, we did have some concerns that in one trial the group taking ursodeoxycholic acid were generally not as healthy at the start of the trial as the group taking placebo. Also, in another trial there were some people who withdrew and were not included in the final analysis, but no reasons for this were given. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence we found to be low or very low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-13 14:04:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Abnormal biliary secretion leads to the thickening of bile and the formation of plugs within the bile ducts; the consequent obstruction and abnormal bile flow ultimately results in the development of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease. This condition peaks in adolescence with up to 20% of adolescents with cystic fibrosis developing chronic liver disease. Early changes in the liver may ultimately result in end-stage liver disease with people needing transplantation. One therapeutic option currently used is ursodeoxycholic acid. This is an update of a previous review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To analyse evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid improves indices of liver function, reduces the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improves outcomes in general in cystic fibrosis.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:40:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted drug companies and searched online trial registries.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 09 April 2017.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for at least three months compared with placebo or no additional treatment in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:26:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. The authors used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:33:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Twelve trials have been identified, of which four trials involving 137 participants were included; data were only available from three of the trials (118 participants) since one cross-over trial did not report appropriate data. The dose of ursodeoxycholic acid ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months. The complex design used in two trials meant that data could only be analysed for subsets of participants. There was no significant difference in weight change, mean difference -0.90 kg (95% confidence interval -1.94 to 0.14) based on 30 participants from two trials. Improvement in biliary excretion was reported in only one trial and no significant change after treatment was shown. There were no data available for analysis for long-term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-01 14:35:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are few trials assessing the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid. The quality of the evidence identified ranged from low to very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify its routine use in cystic fibrosis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:41:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:41:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disease which invariably leads to progressive lung damage. The medical management of associated chronic chest disease has improved greatly over the last 30 years leading to improvement in survival well into adult life. Clinicians are now examining ways of both treating and delaying the progression of the disease in other affected organs. Among these, CF-related liver disease is clinically the most significant hepatic complication with a large impact on morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Leeuwen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeuwen 2014</LINK>). A recent review suggested that hepatobiliary disease is the most common non-pulmonary cause of mortality in CF (the third after pulmonary disease and transplant complications) (<LINK REF="REF-Parisi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parisi 2013</LINK>). A recent epidemiological study reported that there was a significantly higher prevalence of CF-related hepatobiliary abnormalities in people with CF under 18 years of age and 25% of those with CF-related hepatobiliary abnormalities developed hepatobiliary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bhardwaj-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhardwaj 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of liver involvement in CF is thought to be due to a chloride channel defect causing abnormal biliary secretion which leads to the thickening of bile and the formation of plugs within the bile ducts. The resulting ductular obstruction and abnormal bile flow ultimately results in the development of bile duct irregularities inside and outside the liver and cirrhosis in one or several parts of the liver. Therefore, therapy has been directed towards attempting to improve biliary secretion and bile acid composition.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-09 14:04:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid.</P>
<P>It is usual to take UDCA by mouth twice or three times a day, initially for several months but possibly indefinitely. Side effects are rare but diarrhoea has been reported. In 2003, the cost of six months' (24 weeks) treatment with UDCA for a 10-year old child weighing 25 kg, at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, was £131 (<LINK REF="REF-RLCH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RLCH 2003</LINK>). Colombo demonstrated in a dose-response study that the biochemical response to UDCA was best with a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-09 14:05:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In 1990, Erlinger showed that UDCA improves bile acid flow by inducing a bicarbonate-rich bile flow (<LINK REF="REF-Erlinger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erlinger 1990</LINK>). This mechanism has potential use for people with CF-related liver disease in whom the bile ducts are blocked by thick and sticky secretions. Also, UDCA is not as toxic to the liver as other primary bile acids. Initially, UDCA was used in the treatment of gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Roda-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roda 1982</LINK>) and more recently as a possible treatment for other chronic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1991</LINK>) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 1992</LINK>). Over the last few years it has been used in the treatment and prevention of progression of CF-related liver disease following the observation of its therapeutic effectiveness in these other cholestatic conditions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-01 14:41:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are a number of debates surrounding the treatment of people with CF who have liver involvement. Both early detection and assessment of progression of liver disease in CF are relatively difficult. This is because by the time liver disease is evident in a person with an enlarged liver or spleen, there is often already raised pressure in the large vein running through the liver (portal hypertension, usually an irreversible event) and end-stage liver damage (cirrhosis). At this stage the only helpful treatment may be a liver transplant. These problems mean that clinicians are faced with the dilemma of when UDCA should be commenced: early to prevent liver involvement; or later as a therapeutic option.</P>
<P>Another debate is how liver involvement can be evaluated. The important outcomes are death and preventing liver transplantation; other surrogate markers are often used but there are problems associated with these. Biochemical measures of liver function may not be useful because the level of abnormality does not always correlate with the extent of liver involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 1992</LINK>). Abnormalities of these test results may also be due to an effect other than CF liver disease, such as an effect of a drug treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 1992</LINK>). Ultrasound can be used to assess the presence and progression of liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Carty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carty 1995</LINK>). It can show alterations in liver size and texture and can also be used to assess the extent and direction of blood flow in the portal vein. However, results may vary with different operators. Another technique for identifying liver disease is radioisotope scanning (hepatobiliary scintigraphy) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1996</LINK>). Measuring the hepatic excretion of the compound 99mTc-HIDA allows an objective measurement of liver function and bile acid secretion. However, these are all intermediate outcomes and their correlations with the outcomes of death and liver transplantation are unknown.</P>
<P>Although UDCA is relatively inexpensive compared to other treatments taken by people with CF (see above), it is yet another treatment of many and it is important that it has been shown to be effective. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review assessing its effectiveness in people with CF with liver involvement. This is an updated version of earlier versions of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2014</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To analyse evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CF that UDCA improves indices of liver function, reduces the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improves outcomes in general in CF.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:44:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In order to assess the risk of bias in the included trials, we considered such aspects as generation of randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. If we regarded these as adequate then there was a low risk of bias to the trial; if we regarded these as inadequate, then there was a high risk of bias to the trial; and if they were considered unclear then the risk of bias was unclear too. We also considered the degree of blinding and the risk of bias increased as the number of people blinded to the intervention decreased. We also considered other risks of bias, e.g. from selective reporting.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 10:34:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Although we did not specifically excluded cross-over trials, we were concerned about the use of a cross-over design. This was because there may be a carry-over effect of UDCA in the control arm. We did include one cross-over trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). The data presented in the published report appeared to be combined from both treatment periods, but the authors attempted to overcome a possible carry-over effect of UDCA by using a one-month washout period. However, we considered it appropriate to compare only the first six months of the trial, i.e. UDCA versus placebo. Data from the first period were not available in the published report but the authors kindly provided the raw data. Including data from the first period in cross-over trials in meta-analyses is not without problems. Excluding later periods loses some of the information collected. Furthermore, if data from the first period are available in published reports they are likely to represent a biased subset of trials, usually because the authors have found evidence of carry-over (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>

One included trial is of cross-over design but from the full published paper it is unclear whether there was any washout period employed and furthermore, data are not published for the first six-month period of the trial; thus we are unable to extract appropriate data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>). As such, we are only able to present results from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials with a total of 137 participants are included in the review, but results are only available from three trials involving a total of 118 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). The ages of the participants ranged from 4 years to 32 years. The dose of UDCA given ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day.</P>
<P>In three trials the comparison was with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). In the fourth trial the comparison was with existing conventional therapy (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). In three of the trials all of the participants had liver disease (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>), whereas in the third trial only 10 out of 51 participants had liver disease (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The length of follow-up was generally short and ranged from six months (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>) to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Important long-term outcomes such as death or the need for liver transplant were not reported. Only two of our protocol-defined outcomes were assessed: the nutritional indices (weight gain and skinfold thickness (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>)); and biliary excretion (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial design was complicated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the Merli cross-over trial, 51 participants were randomised to receive UDCA alone or with taurine for six months and then each treatment group was compared with a six-month placebo period (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). The sequence of treatment and placebo was then randomised in a cross-over design. The data presented in the published report of the cross-over RCT appeared to be combined from both treatment periods. Although we had not specifically excluded cross-over trials, we were concerned about the use of a cross-over design. This was because there may be a carry-over effect of UDCA in the control arm, although the authors attempted to overcome this by using a one-month washout period. However, we considered it appropriate to compare only the first six months of the trial, i.e. UDCA versus placebo. Data from the first period were not available in the published report but the authors have kindly provided the raw data. Including data from the first period in cross-over trials in meta-analyses is not without problems. Excluding later periods loses some of the information collected. Furthermore, if data from the first period are available in published reports they are likely to represent a biased subset of trials, usually because the authors have found evidence of carry-over (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>In a further cross-over trial we were unable to ascertain whether a washout period was employed and data were not presented for the first treatment period; we have not been able to clarify this information and have therefore decided not to present any results from this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lepage-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A factorial parallel design was employed in the Colombo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>). In this multicentre trial, 55 participants were randomised to receive UDCA or placebo and then each group was further randomised to receive either taurine or a second placebo. In effect, four parallel groups were studied.</P>
<P>In the O'Brien trial, 12 participants were randomised to UDCA or no additional therapy for six months (other than usual CF treatments, such as pancreatic enzymes and oral calorie supplements, which the UDCA group also received) (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). Advanced liver disease, as documented by portal hypertension or histological features of fibrosis or cirrhosis or all three, was present in 11 out of 12 participants.</P>
<P>The use of taurine in two trials also complicated their design and analysis since taurine may affect liver involvement in CF (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). Although UDCA is known to cause taurine depletion, the combined effect of UDCA and taurine on liver function is unknown.</P>
<P>These possible interactions and the complex trial designs caused difficulties when we considered combining the data. We have used subsets of the sample sizes given in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table so the participant numbers evaluated in the data tables and figures do not always tally with the sample sizes. In the Merli cross-over trial we decided only to use data from the first six months of the UDCA/placebo group and not use the UDCA plus taurine group (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). This gave us data on an unbalanced number of participants in the two groups in the first six-month period: only six participants in the UDCA group and 12 participants in the control group (51 were initially randomised). In the factorial, parallel trial we decided not to use data from participants who received taurine (hence the total number of participants used in the data tables was 28 not 55) (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>). However, only four of these 18 participants in this subset had abnormal liver enzymes at baseline.</P>
<P>Another issue of the Merli cross-over RCT was that although weight, height and body mass percentile were measured, we had concerns about this type of trial design (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>). We would expect there to be a period effect on variables such as weight and height and this would require more subtle analysis. Again, we decided to use data only from participants in the UDCA-alone group and from the first six months of the trial before cross over.</P>
<P>In 2005, Colombo presented follow-up survival data (obtained by a data collection form sent to each centre) from the RCT that had been conducted in 1990 (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>). Information was obtained from 53 of the original 55 participants (two were lost to follow-up) for a median total period of follow-up of 13.6 years; follow-up data for the whole cohort were presented, not by randomised group. The majority of the trial participants had continued open UDCA therapy after the end of the trial (median daily dose 666 mg).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Reduction of raised hepatocellular enzymes to within normal range of the method stated</HEADING>
<P>We wished to examine the effect of UDCA on abnormal liver biochemistry by comparing the numbers of participants in both groups whose liver enzymes fell to within the normal range of the method stated at various time points. This was not reported as an outcome measure in any of the three RCTs but, serving as a proxy for this, the improvement in abnormalities of liver function was measured in all three RCTs. Raw data were available from two of the RCTs to enable us to examine this outcome (personal communication) (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). We assessed this outcome in three different ways (all with a very low quality of evidence): normalisation of any liver enzyme reported, odds ratio (OR) 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.24) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); normalisation of all liver enzymes reported (OR not estimable as there were no participants in either of the two trials with all enzymes normalised) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); and normalisation of individual liver enzymes (OR less than one for three out of four enzymes but the CIs were very wide) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

<P>Need for liver transplantation was not specifically used as an outcome measure in any of the RCTs. However, one trial reported that one participant, who initially had multilobular cirrhosis and oesophageal varices (advanced liver involvement) and was allocated to treatment with UDCA, was subsequently withdrawn due to further deterioration of liver function (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>). This participant proceeded to liver transplantation. However, the CI of the OR generated was very wide and it was not possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of UDCA on the need for transplants (very low quality of evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>)</P>
<P>Need for liver transplantation was reported as an outcome in the long-term follow-up data from the Colombo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>). Six participants underwent liver transplantation. However, these long-term data were reported as follow up for the whole cohort, not by randomised group. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of UDCA therapy on the need for liver transplantation from these data.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-08-09 11:08:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>This systematic review was first conducted in 1995 and over the intervening 22 years, no new meaningful clinical trial data have become available to change the original conclusions.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-30 15:22:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This first systematic review on the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) highlights the paucity of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There have been no RCTs investigating UDCA for preventing the development of liver disease in people with CF. Disappointingly, the few RCTs carried out have not adequately examined our pre-defined outcome measures, but they do provide important preliminary information which requires further evaluation. There was considerable variation in the outcome measures examined in the three RCTs and in the time points at which they were measured.</P>
<P>This review has shown the absence of any significant effects of UDCA treatment on people with CF, apart from a slight effect on the surrogate endpoint of reduction of raised liver enzymes to normal. The information received from the authors of the six-month trials showed that no participants died, needed liver transplants or developed portal hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). However, these are short-term trials and there is insufficient evidence to show that UDCA improves survival or reduces the need for liver transplantation. We failed to show a significant effect of UDCA on weight change; but this is not the most appropriate way of assessing change in nutritional status (see below). The only trial that assessed the effect of UDCA on biliary excretion failed to demonstrate any significant change after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although in our quantitative analysis we excluded data on participants who also received taurine, we will briefly mention individual trial results. The Merli trial showed that a six-month period of UDCA with or without taurine did not significantly affect the nutritional status (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>), whilst Colombo failed to show an effect of UDCA on liver enzymes (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 11:08:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>It is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from these results which are taken from small numbers of participants. Furthermore, several clinically meaningful outcomes, such as portal hypertension, liver transplantation and survival were not assessed. A number of surrogate endpoints have been reported; however, we cannot be sure that these actually correlate with important endpoints. For example, there is no evidence of a clear correlation between the serum level of hepatocellular enzymes and the degree of liver disease.</P>
<P>Change in weight is not the most appropriate way of assessing any change in nutritional status. This is because we would expect children to gain weight over time, but expect the weight of adults to remain stable. It would be more appropriate to use indices such as body mass index or weight for height as a z score (where weight is expressed as a percentage of ideal for height and then compared with the standard deviation for the population).</P>
<P>In this review we have included trials with a non-homogenous population (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 1994</LINK>) and have, therefore, considered both possible preventative and therapeutic effects of UDCA in the same review. As we cannot be sure how raised levels of certain liver enzymes correlate with liver involvement (or whether absence of raised enzymes indicates a lack of liver involvement), we decided that we would lose important information if this trial were excluded.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:31:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Although we had not specifically excluded cross-over trials, we were concerned about the use of a cross-over design. This was because there may be a carry-over effect of UDCA in the control arm, although the authors of the included cross-over trial attempted to overcome this problem by using a one-month washout period. However, we considered it appropriate to compare only the first six months of the trial, i.e. UDCA versus placebo.</P>
<P>We were only able to perform a limited quantitative meta-analysis due to the lack of data on clinically relevant endpoints and the different time points at which outcomes were measured. However, this systematic review provides an important summary of the information currently available from RCTs on the use of UDCA. This information may be used to inform the design of subsequent RCTs.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence identified ranged from low to very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-30 15:23:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">

<P>We have been unable to find any other similar reviews of UDCA in CF or any further studies other than the ones we have already included or excluded. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-09 11:16:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Although UDCA is relatively inexpensive compared to other CF treatments, it would need to be taken on a long-term basis if it is effective. If it is ineffective then the resources saved by not using it could be used for other aspects of CF care.</P>
<P>Evidence of the effectiveness of UDCA is inconclusive. Routine use of UDCA in people with CF cannot, therefore, be justified. However, in view of these important preliminary results and because of the lack of any other effective intervention to prevent or treat CF-related liver disease, it is essential that a large multicentre RCT of UDCA in people with CF is undertaken.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The results of this systematic review indicate that there is an urgent need for a well-designed, adequately powered, multicentre RCT assessing the effectiveness of UDCA by measuring clinically relevant end points over years rather than months. Ideally a parallel trial, not a cross-over trial, should be undertaken. However, as there is insufficient evidence to indicate that UDCA is effective in CF, it is not possible to suggest how long it should be given, but long-term end points need to be assessed. Future trials should define the target population clearly, with separate trials for those without clinically detectable liver disease (the preventative effect) and those with liver disease (the therapeutic effect). In view of the problems of defining and assessing progression of liver involvement as well as the problem that by the time liver involvement is detected, it is too advanced for treatment, we suggest that the former is carried out first.</P>
<P>Although we have not been able to perform a formal meta-analysis, the RCTs we have identified show important preliminary results.</P>
