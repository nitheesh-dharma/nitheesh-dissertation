<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Corticosteroids are used in the first instance to achieve remission. Some children do not respond to this treatment (steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome) and other agents such as cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin, tacrolimus) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be used.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register (up to 2 March 2016) through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Randomised controlled trials were included if they compared different immunosuppressive agents or non-immunosuppressive agents with placebo, prednisone or other agent given orally or parenterally in children aged three months to 18 years with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>This review found that when cyclosporin was compared to placebo or no treatment there was a significant increase in the number of children who achieved complete remission. Calcineurin inhibitors also significantly increased the number of children, who achieved complete or partial remission compared with IV cyclophosphamide. There was no improvement with other immunosuppressive agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors significantly reduced the degree of proteinuria. However the number of studies was small with small numbers of children per study.</P>

<P>The majority of children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome achieve remission with corticosteroid therapy. Children who fail to respond may be treated with immunosuppressive agents including calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin or tacrolimus) and with non-immunosuppressive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi).

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-09 16:04:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using the random effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-29 14:52:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Elisabeth M Hodson">
<P>Nineteen RCTs (820 children enrolled; 773 evaluated) were included. Most studies were small. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment and only four studies were at low risk of performance bias. Fifteen, eight and 10 studies were at low risk of detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias respectively. Cyclosporin when compared with placebo or no treatment significantly increased the number of children who achieved complete remission. However this was based on only eight children who achieved remission with cyclosporin compared with no children who achieved remission with placebo/no treatment in three small studies (49 children: RR 7.66, 95% CI 1.06 to 55.34). Calcineurin inhibitors significantly increased the number with complete or partial remission compared with IV cyclophosphamide (2 studies, 156 children: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 20%). There was no significant differences in the number who achieved complete remission between tacrolimus versus cyclosporin (1 study, 41 children: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.66), cyclosporin versus mycophenolate mofetil plus dexamethasone (1 study, 138 children: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24), oral cyclophosphamide with prednisone versus prednisone alone (2 studies, 91 children: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87), IV versus oral cyclophosphamide (1 study, 11 children: RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.81 to 12.06), IV cyclophosphamide versus oral cyclophosphamide plus IV dexamethasone (1 study, 49 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.96), and azathioprine with prednisone versus prednisone alone (1 study, 31 children: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.15 to 5.84). One study found no significant differences between three agents (cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide) used in combination with tacrolimus and prednisone. One study found no significant difference in the percentage reduction in proteinuria (31 children: -12; 95% CI -73 to 110) between rituximab with cyclosporin/prednisolone and cyclosporin/prednisolone alone. Two studies reported ACEi significantly reduced proteinuria.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 10:53:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>To date RCTs have demonstrated that calcineurin inhibitors increase the likelihood of complete or partial remission compared with placebo/no treatment or cyclophosphamide. For other regimens assessed, it remains uncertain whether the interventions alter outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is low. Further adequately powered, well designed RCTs are needed to evaluate other regimens for children with idiopathic SRNS. Since SRNS represents a spectrum of diseases, future studies should enrol children from better defined groups of patients with SRNS.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-18 14:43:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-18 14:33:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the glomeruli of the kidney leak protein from the blood into the urine. It results in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. Children with untreated nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of bacterial infection, characteristically resulting in peritonitis, cellulitis or septicaemia, of thromboembolic phenomena, protein calorie malnutrition. Prospective studies of children with newly diagnosed idiopathic nephrotic syndrome identified through Pediatric Surveillance Units in the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand reported incidences of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of 1.12 to 1.9 per 100,000 children aged below 16 years (<LINK REF="REF-El-Bakkali-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Bakkali 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sureshkumar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sureshkumar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In clinical studies childhood nephrotic syndrome is classified into steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS), steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome (0 to 12 months) and nephrotic syndrome secondary to other diseases including Henoch Schönlein nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatitis B nephropathy. Most children respond to corticosteroid therapy. In those children who fail to respond to corticosteroids, kidney biopsy is performed to determine pathology. The majority of children with SRNS have minimal change disease (MCD), mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). FSGS is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in children. FSGS is a heterogeneous disease with some children having FSGS secondary to immunological factors, some children having FSGS secondary to mutations in the genes coding for podocyte proteins including podocin and nephrin and a few older children having FSGS secondary to hyperfiltration (reduced kidney mass, obesity, diabetes mellitus) (<LINK REF="REF-Deegens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deegens 2011</LINK>). A study of 1783 unrelated families found that single gene mutations responsible for SRNS were identified in 29.5% families overall with mutations in 25.3% children aged 1 to 6 years old, 17.8% in children aged 7 to 12 years and 10.8% in adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Sadowski-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadowski 2015</LINK>). Few children with FSGS secondary to genetic mutations respond to immunosuppressive agents and in these children, nephrotic syndrome rarely recurs following kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Ding-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ding 2014</LINK>). Children with SRNS may have corticosteroid resistant disease from initial presentation (Initial resistance) or may develop steroid resistance after one or more responses to corticosteroids (delayed steroid resistance). About one third of children suffer recurrence of nephrotic syndrome following kidney transplantation. Recent data suggest that recurrence of disease post transplant is much more common in children with SRNS and delayed steroid resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Ding-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ding 2014</LINK>). These data are consistent with an immunological cause of SRNS in these children.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-18 14:43:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Oral corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for a child presenting with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. For children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome, about 90% will achieve remission with corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>). Of those who respond, about 95% will have responded after four weeks of daily corticosteroid therapy and 98% will have responded after eight weeks of corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-ISKDC-1981a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISKDC 1981a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children who fail to respond to corticosteroids are treated with immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (cyclosporin, tacrolimus), cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, and the anti CD 20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab. Rates of complete and partial remission with CNI based on observational studies and individual groups in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) vary between 30% and 80% (<LINK REF="STD-Choudhry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Choudhry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1994</LINK>). Remission rates of up to 60% with combinations of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide are reported in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Tune-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tune 1996</LINK>) and of around 50% in individual treatment groups in RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1996</LINK>). Failure to achieve complete or partial remission is associated with progression to ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2006</LINK>). Other non-immunosuppressive agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and fish oil have also been used in SRNS.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-11 17:31:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and monoclonal antibodies may act by suppressing production of plasma factors by T and B cells since immunological mechanisms are believed to be responsible for some cases of SRNS. Some immunosuppressive medications including dexamethasone, the CNI, and rituximab may be effective in nonimmune causes of SRNS by directly targeting podocytes. ACEi and ARB reduce proteinuria and are aimed at reducing progressive glomerulosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Deegens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deegens 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-11 16:38:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There is considerable diversity in the use of these agents with differences in treatment modes, combinations and dosage regimens. Optimal combinations with least toxicity remain to be determined. Despite the use of newer immunosuppressive agents, the response rate to therapy remains relatively low. The aims of the update of this systematic review initially published in 2002 were to identify new RCTs assessing the benefits and harms of interventions used to treat idiopathic SRNS in children and to incorporate them where appropriate in meta-analyses.</P>

<P>The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that were relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by two authors, who discarded studies that were not applicable.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>For this update we have presented the main results of the review in a 'Summary of findings' table/s. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of the available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' table also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011b</LINK>).

<P>For the initial 2004 version of the review, of the 1744 titles and abstracts screened, 10 studies were identified; one study was excluded so nine studies (10 reports) were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bagga-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bagga 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chongviriyaphan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chongviriyaphan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elhence-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elhence 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1970" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ponticelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Ponticelli 1993a</LINK>). An update in 2006 identified four additional studies of which two were included (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinknecht-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinknecht 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yi 2006</LINK>) so the 2006 update included 11 studies (13 reports). A second update in 2010 identified three additional studies and the full publication of one study previously available as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Yi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yi 2006</LINK>). Therefore 14 studies (18 reports) were included in the 2010 update; 494 children entered the studies and 449 were evaluated.</P>
<P>A further search to March 2, 2016 identified 21 new studies, of which five were included (<LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnasco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Magnasco 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2015</LINK>). The 2016 update includes 19 studies (42 reports) comprising 820 children of whom 773 were evaluated (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Although we were not able to obtain separate paediatric data from the authors, we chose to include <LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK> because it was one of the largest studies looking at interventions for SRNS, 93 (67%) of participants were below 18 years of age and subgroup analyses by study authors showed no differences in outcomes between paediatric and adult participants. We also identified three ongoing studies. The first study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of sparsentan (a dual endothelin receptor) in a phase 2 study compared with irbesartan (an ARB) (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01613118" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01613118</LINK>). The second study is evaluating the 12 month relapse free survival in children with SRNS treated with rituximab or tacrolimus (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02382575" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02382575</LINK>). The third study is evaluating ofatumumab compared with placebo in children with steroid- and calcineurin-inhibitor-resistant nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02394106" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02394106</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 10:53:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In this update we have now included 19 studies, enrolling 820 children of which 773 were evaluated.</P>
<P>Three studies examined the efficacy of CNI compared with placebo or supportive treatment. A meta-analysis of three small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ponticelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Ponticelli 1993a</LINK>) showed that cyclosporin increased the number of children with SRNS, who achieved complete or partial remission. However this result was based on only 8/26 children, who achieved remission with cyclosporin compared with 0/23 children who achieved remission with placebo/no treatment. Nevertheless these data support previously published data from a large case series of 65 children with initial non-response to steroids in which 46% of children with MCD (21/45) and 30% with FSGS (6/20) achieved complete remission with cyclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1994</LINK>). There were no data presented in these studies on the effect of cyclosporin on long term kidney function.</P>
<P>Two studies found no statistically significant differences in remission rates or prevention of kidney function deterioration with oral cyclophosphamide compared with prednisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1996</LINK>). In addition children treated with oral CNI were significantly more likely to achieve complete or partial remission compared with IV cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-APN-2008" TYPE="STUDY">APN 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Choudhry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Choudhry 2009</LINK> found no significant differences in efficacy between tacrolimus and cyclosporin though the important cosmetic adverse effects of hirsutism and gum hypertrophy were limited to cyclosporin therapy. <LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK> found no significant differences in efficacy between cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil with dexamethasone in children and young adults with primary FSGS. Among children, who achieved remission with tacrolimus, <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2015</LINK> found that satisfactory remission (complete or partial remission and infrequent relapses) occurred more commonly with tacrolimus than mycophenolate mofetil.</P>
<P>These data suggest that CNI should be used in preference to cyclophosphamide in children with SRNS. Further studies are required to determine the relative efficacies of CNI and mycophenolate mofetil.</P>
<P>In the remaining studies of immunosuppressive agents, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elhence-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elhence 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mantan 2008</LINK>) compared IV with oral cyclophosphamide and found no significant differences in efficacy between treatment groups. Single studies of azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-ISKDC-1970" TYPE="STUDY">ISKDC 1970</LINK>) or tuna fish oil (<LINK REF="STD-Chongviriyaphan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chongviriyaphan 1999</LINK>) showed no evidence of benefit. <LINK REF="STD-Kleinknecht-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinknecht 1980</LINK> found no significant differences between chlorambucil and indomethacin in the number who achieved remission or developed ESKD. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2015</LINK> found no significant differences in efficacy between mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide or leflunomide in children already treated with tacrolimus and prednisone. <LINK REF="STD-Magnasco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Magnasco 2012</LINK> found no significant benefit of rituximab over CNI with prednisone in children with SRNS, who were resistant to corticosteroids and CNI.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bagga-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bagga 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yi 2006</LINK>) found that the ACEi, enalapril and fosinopril reduced proteinuria significantly in children with SRNS. However the studies were too short to provide data on whether ACE inhibition provides long term reduction in proteinuria and protects against deterioration in kidney function.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-18 14:34:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Currently CNI, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil are used to treat SRNS. There are limited data from RCTs to demonstrate the efficacy of CNI compared with placebo and from RCTs to show no significant benefit of cyclophosphamide. However two studies have demonstrated that CNI are more effective than cyclophosphamide with less toxicity. These data support the use of CNI in children with SRNS and suggest that cyclophosphamide should not be used. Although a single study (<LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK>) found no significant difference in efficacy between cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil with dexamethasone, it was underpowered so it could not completely exclude a significant difference between the interventions. Further studies are required to assess the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in SRNS though <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2015</LINK> found that tacrolimus was more effective in maintaining satisfactory remission than mycophenolate mofetil. <LINK REF="STD-Magnasco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Magnasco 2012</LINK> found no benefit of rituximab in children with SRNS. However this was a small study with only three months of follow up in children with SRNS, who were also resistant to CNI. Therefore a role for rituximab in children with SRNS has not been excluded particularly in children who show some response to CNI.</P>
<P>We hypothesised that the different pathologies in SRNS would influence the response to immunosuppressive agents and that children with MCD would be more likely to respond to treatment than children with FSGS as suggested by some non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehrich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrich 2007</LINK>) though others have identified little difference (<LINK REF="REF-Chua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chua 2009</LINK>). While no differences in efficacy in children with MCD or FSGS could be demonstrated for comparisons between cyclosporin and cyclophosphamide or tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, the studies were too small to exclude a difference in treatment responses between pathologies. Observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrich 2007</LINK>) had suggested that the relative efficacies of treatment regimens differed between children with initial compared with delayed steroid resistance. Subgroup analyses in studies which enrolled children with initial and delayed steroid resistance found no differences in efficacy between such patient groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mantan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2015</LINK>). However the subgroups involved small numbers of patients so a difference in efficacy of CNI between children with initial or delayed steroid resistance cannot be completely excluded.</P>
<P>Data from the PodoNet Registry cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Trautmann-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trautmann 2015</LINK>) found that 22% of 1234 children with SRNS had received oral or pulse cyclophosphamide while 44% had received steroid pulses although no RCTs were identified, which examined the benefits or harms of high dose steroids with alkylating agents compared with placebo, prednisone or no specific therapy. Uncontrolled studies of regimens of alkylating agents and high dose steroids have reported complete remission in 32% to 65% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Hari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hari 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tune-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tune 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tune-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tune 1996</LINK>) though adverse events of these regimens are significant. No RCTs comparing a CNI and low or high dose prednisone with placebo, prednisone or no specific treatment were identified. A retrospective analysis of children with non-genetic FSGS found that the cumulative proportion of children achieving complete remission after treatment with IV methylprednisolone, oral cyclosporin and oral prednisone was 84% and significantly higher than the 64% of children, who achieved complete remission with oral cyclosporin and oral prednisone alone (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrich 2007</LINK>). In the PodoNet Registry cohort, a CNI with oral corticosteroids was the most commonly used intervention with 65% of children with SRNS receiving one or more periods of treatment with these medications (<LINK REF="REF-Trautmann-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trautmann 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>No study to date has taken into account the information that a proportion of patients with FSGS have mutations in genes coding for podocin, nephrin and other proteins and are unlikely to respond to therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrich-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrich 2007</LINK>). Two studies included information about genetic studies (<LINK REF="STD-APN-2008" TYPE="STUDY">APN 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choudhry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Choudhry 2009</LINK>) but the data were not used to exclude children from studies. Response to therapy with any medication varies between studies with the number of children achieving complete or partial remission varying between 0% to 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Lombel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombel 2013</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK> found that in the USA 46% of patients responded to cyclosporin while studies from India (<LINK REF="STD-Choudhry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Choudhry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>) found that over 80% responded to CNI. The differences in response to CNI between studies could be related to differences in the incidence of genetic mutations between different racial groups, to differences in the proportions of children with FSGS and MCD and to the inclusion of children with initial and delayed steroid resistance. <LINK REF="STD-FSGS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">FSGS Study 2011</LINK> only enrolled subjects with FSGS and initial steroid resistance whereas the Indian studies (<LINK REF="STD-Choudhry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Choudhry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2012</LINK>) included children with FSGS and MCD and children with initial or delayed steroid resistance. If SRNS with delayed steroid resistance is more likely than initial steroid-resistant disease to have an immunological cause as suggested by the higher incidence of recurrence post transplant in children with delayed steroid resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Ding-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ding 2014</LINK>), then children with delayed steroid resistance may have increased response rates to immunosuppressive agents.</P>
<P>The incidence of reported adverse events during treatment was low but could be underestimated because of small patient numbers, short follow-up periods and incomplete reporting. None of the three studies comparing cyclosporin with placebo/no treatment reported on nephrotoxicity though nephrotoxicity occurs in 9% of treated children (<LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ponticelli-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponticelli 1993b</LINK>). The numbers with persistent or reversible nephrotoxicity did not differ between cyclosporin and tacrolimus. Similar number of children developed or suffered worsening of hypertension during treatments with cyclosporin or IV cyclophosphamide and with cyclosporin or tacrolimus. Episodes of Infection were more common with alkylating agents than with cyclosporin.</P>
<P>No subgroup analyses could be undertaken because of the paucity of data. Also funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) could not be used because of the limited number of studies for each intervention.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-06 10:55:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Studies included in this systematic review were small, often of poor quality and addressed several different therapeutic regimens, which limited the opportunities for meta-analysis. Study quality can affect study results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and combining poor quality studies in meta-analyses can provide erroneous information on the benefits of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Eleven studies were at low risk for selection bias. Four studies were at low risk of performance bias although, since the majority of studies (15 studies) used a laboratory measurement of proteinuria for the primary outcome of remission, there was less risk of detection bias. Eight and 10 studies respectively were considered to be free of attrition or selective outcome bias. It is possible that attrition bias influenced the outcomes in the studies comparing cyclosporin with placebo/no treatment. In three studies 10/59 (17%) randomised patients, included in the meta-analysis comparing cyclosporin with placebo/no treatment, were excluded from analyses after randomisation. Studies with attrition bias and thus no intention-to-treat analysis can exaggerate the efficacy of the experimental treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many analyses there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. However the CI were often very wide, with the limits indicating the possibility of substantial benefit or substantial harm from the intervention(s) compared with the comparator(s). The results in many studies for some outcomes were therefore imprecise indicating that if these interventions were analysed in new studies, the results could change the estimates of benefits and harms considerably. This is reflected in the Summary of Findings Tables. The overall quality of the evidence (GRADE) was considered low for the comparison of cyclosporin with placebo/no treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) because of small numbers of patients and events and because of increased risk of selection and performance bias. In the comparison of CNI with IV cyclophosphamide, the overall quality of the evidence for complete or partial remission was considered low or very low but considered to be moderate or low for adverse effects (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was downgraded because of small numbers of patients and events resulting in imprecision and the high risk of attrition bias in one study. In the comparison of cyclosporin with MMF and IV dexamethasone, the overall quality of the evidence was considered moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). It was downgraded because the number of recruited patients was insufficient to exclude a difference between medications.

<P>This review identified 19 studies of which two were available only as an abstract. Additional information was provided by the authors from two studies. The literature search is likely to identify all relevant published studies including studies only available as abstracts. Since 40% of study reports in the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register have been identified by handsearching of conference proceedings, it remains possible that further studies of therapy for SRNS will be identified as conference proceedings from different congresses are searched.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-18 13:41:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The treatment of SRNS in children has been comprehensively reviewed recently by <LINK REF="REF-Chua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chua 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Colquitt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colquitt 2007</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Colquitt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colquitt 2007</LINK> included nine RCTs (all included in this review), one controlled clinical trial (comparing six months with 18 months of IV methylprednisolone) and one prospective cohort study comparing IV methylprednisolone with IV dexamethasone. They concluded that while the available evidence suggested a beneficial effect of cyclosporin on remission rates and of cyclophosphamide on time to remission, the strength of the conclusions was limited by the poor quality of included studies. <LINK REF="REF-Chua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chua 2009</LINK> assessed observational studies, which evaluated complete or partial remission in 494 children treated with cyclosporin or tacrolimus, 192 treated with oral alkylating agents, 71 treated with IV cyclophosphamide and 204 treated with IV pulse corticosteroid with cyclophosphamide or cyclosporin. Overall these observational studies indicated that one third to a half of patients with SRNS achieve complete remission with cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide and/or IV methylprednisolone. RCTs indicate that patients treated with cyclosporin are significantly more likely to achieve complete or partial remission when compared with placebo or no specific therapy or with IV cyclophosphamide. Based on these studies, the KDIGO guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Lombel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombel 2013</LINK>) recommend that the initial treatment of children with SRNS should be with a CNI for a minimum of six months.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:56:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The update of this systematic review continues to highlight how few studies have addressed the efficacy of interventions for SRNS in children. The studies were generally small and of variable quality. Many studies did not provide data on the duration of remission, on kidney dysfunction including the number progressing to ESKD or on mortality although these are important patient centred outcomes. However based on the included studies, CNI appear to be of benefit for children with SRNS while cyclophosphamide is less effective and more toxic suggesting that the initial treatment of SRNS should be with CNI. ACEi significantly reduce proteinuria in children with SRNS so they should be used in children with SRNS (<LINK REF="REF-Lombel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombel 2013</LINK>).<B>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:57:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Further studies are required to assess therapies in SRNS. In particular further studies of mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab compared with CNI are warranted. These studies should be of sufficient duration to assess complete remission rates, relapse rates, kidney function and adverse events and to assess any differences in response between children with MCD or FSGS and children with initial steroid resistance and those with delayed steroid resistance. In addition studies should attempt to investigate the optimal dosing or blood concentrations of CNI or mycophenolate mofetil required to achieve remission in children with SRNS. Children with genetic mutations resulting in SRNS rarely respond to therapy. Children entering RCTs should be screened for mutations before study entry and those with mutations should be excluded from studies of immunosuppressive agents because of the risks of toxic therapies in such children.</P>
<P>The responses of children with SRNS to current immunosuppressive agents are variable but in many studies fewer than 50% respond to any therapies. Therefore different strategies are needed to treat SRNS. Medications that stabilise the podocyte skeleton (dexamethasone, CNI, rituximab) and antifibrotic drugs (pioglitazone) are being evaluated as treatments for SRNS (<LINK REF="REF-Deegens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deegens 2011</LINK>).</P>
