<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane systematic review aimed to look at evidence comparing use of sedation versus general anaesthesia to help children (up to 18 years of age) undergoing dental treatment. We wanted to see which (if any) approach allowed dental treatment to be carried out safely and effectively. We were also interested in the relative financial cost of each approach.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>At present, children unable to cope with dental care under local anaesthetic may be given general anaesthesia or sedation to help them. This choice is dependent on factors such as patient or dentist preference, the cost of the procedure or local regulations. Some people believe that sedation is better for this, as patients prefer it and it may be cheaper.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>For our original review, we searched the databases until October 2008. For this updated review, we searched the following databases to July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and ISI Web of Science.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we could not identify any randomized controlled trials on this topic. These trials are required for comparison of dental general anaesthesia versus sedation, to quantify differences such as morbidity and cost.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A significant proportion of children have caries requiring restorations or extractions, and some of these children will not accept this treatment under local anaesthetic. Historically this has been managed by the use of a general anaesthetic in children; however, use of sedation may lead to reduced morbidity and cost. The aim of this review was to compare the efficiency of sedation versus general anaesthesia (GA) for provision of dental treatment to children and adolescents younger than 18 years. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2012 and again in 2015.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We will evaluate morbidity and effectiveness of sedation versus GA for provision of dental treatment to patients younger than 18 years. If data become available, we will analyse the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. If data are not available, we will obtain crude estimates of cost.</P>
<P>Morbidity can be defined as 'an undesired result or complication'. For the purposes of this review, 'postoperative morbidity' refers to undesired results or complications such as nausea following a procedure, once the patient had been restored to consciousness and could breathe unaided. 'Intraoperative morbidity' refers to any complications that occur during the procedure that may necessitate action by the anaesthetist or the sedationist, such as respiratory arrest.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE Ovid SP (1950 to July 2015); EMBASE Ovid SP (1974 to July 2015); System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (1980 to October July 2012); Latin American &amp; Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to July 2015); and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1945 to July 2015).</P>
<P>We also carried out handsearching of relevant journals to July 2015. We imposed no language restriction.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We planned to include randomized controlled clinical trials that compared sedative agents versus general anaesthesia in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age undergoing dental treatment. We excluded complex surgical procedures and pseudo-randomized trials.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two review authors assessed titles and abstracts for inclusion in the review. We recorded information relevant to objectives and outcome measures by using a specially designed 'data extraction form'. We will employ the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to interpret findings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In our original review, we identified 16 studies for potential inclusion after searching available databases and screening titles and abstracts. After retrieving full-text studies, we found none to be eligible. We identified no additional studies in the updated search of July 2012. We identified two studies for possible inclusion in the updated search of July 2015; again we found these to be ineligible.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>It is widely recognized that the level of caries in children of industrialized nations has dropped substantially over the past few decades. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of these children still have caries, which often remain untreated. Untreated decay into dentine in primary teeth was found in 28% of five-year-olds and in 39% of eight-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-Child-Dental-Health-Survey-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Child Dental Health Survey 2013</LINK>). Similar patterns of disease are seen in other developed countries. This represents a significant problem because if dentine caries are left untreated, they usually lead to pain and sepsis, which often can be managed only by extraction or extensive restoration of affected teeth.</P>
<P>The obvious alternative is to provide treatment under local anaesthesia; however, some children will not be able to accept this. Barriers to treatment may include dental fear or behaviour management problems. Dental fear and behaviour management problems are closely related phenomena; in one study, 61% of children with dental fear presented with behaviour management problems (<LINK REF="REF-Klingberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingberg 1995</LINK>). Estimates of the prevalence of dental fear are difficult to find; however, one Swedish study reported that 10.5% of children in a population of four- to 11-year-olds had behaviour management problems (<LINK REF="REF-Klingberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingberg 1994</LINK>). Dental fear or anxiety is associated with increased levels of caries (<LINK REF="REF-Julihn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julihn 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methods of managing anxiety and behaviour are required to meet this need. Whilst behavioural techniques that do not involve the use of drugs can play an important part in management of a child's treatment, many children find it difficult to tolerate dental treatment. In these cases, sedation or general anaesthesia could be considered as a method for reducing anxiety and facilitating provision of dental treatment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Sedation or general anaesthesia (GA) is widely used to manage behaviour and to support provision of dental treatment across the world. However, it is unclear whether either technique offers advantages over the other. Both carry risks of mortality (albeit small) and postoperative morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Atan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chicka-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chicka 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2000</LINK>). Finally, both procedures require use of additional facilities, including drugs, equipment and staff; therefore, both lead to additional costs for the service provider and the patient.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>One of these interventions might be superior to the other in terms of cost, safety and patient acceptance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We are conducting this systematic review in an attempt to determine which is the most safe, effective and cost-efficient method of providing dental care for children who cannot accept care under local anaesthetic without additional support.</P>
<P>Therefore, the aim of this review was to compare the efficiency of sedation versus GA for provision of dental treatment to children and adolescents younger than 18 years. Gaining an understanding of the costs involved in providing GA was another objective of this review (costs may be affected by how and where the anaesthetic or sedation is administered).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We will evaluate the morbidity and effectiveness of sedation versus GA for provision of dental treatment to patients younger than 18 years. If data become available, we will analyse the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. If data are not available, we will obtain crude estimates of cost.</P>
<P>Morbidity can be defined as 'an undesired result or complication'. For the purposes of this review, 'postoperative morbidity' refers to undesired results or complications such as nausea following a procedure, once a patient had been restored to consciousness and could breathe unaided. 'Intraoperative morbidity' refers to any complications that occur during the procedure that may necessitate action by the anaesthetist or the sedationist, such as respiratory arrest.</P>

<P>The criteria applied for risk of bias judgements regarding allocation concealment are given below, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: adequate concealment of the allocation (e.g. sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomization).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias: uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (e.g. when the method of concealment is not described or is not described in sufficient detail to allow a definitive judgement).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: inadequate allocation concealment (e.g. investigators knew in advance what the allocated assignment of the next participant would be).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to undertake a summary assessment of risk of bias for the primary outcome (across domains) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Within a study, a summary assessment of low risk of bias will be given when low risk of bias is noted for all key domains, unclear risk of bias when unclear risk of bias is seen for one or more key domains and high risk of bias when high risk of bias is observed for one or more key domains. Across studies, a summary assessment will be rated as having low risk of bias when most information is derived from studies at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias when most information is derived from studies at low or unclear risk of bias, and high risk of bias when the proportion of information derived from studies at high risk of bias is sufficient to affect interpretation of results.</P>
<P>We plan to include in this review all studies meeting the selection criteria regardless of quality.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing general anaesthesia (GA) versus sedation for providing dental care to children. Some publications compared any form of sedation versus GA using methods such as case control studies (<LINK REF="REF-Averley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Averley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jameson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jameson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyratzopoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyratzopoulos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silay-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Silay 2013</LINK>). Comments related to these studies are provided below.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-24 18:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>If treatment with sedation is to be an effective alternative to GA, it needs to allow provision of similar levels of dental treatment and should be suitable for younger children, as they are more likely to require GA. Use of nitrous oxide and oxygen (IHS) was reviewed by Lyratzopoulos and Blain (<LINK REF="REF-Lyratzopoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyratzopoulos 2003</LINK>), who noted that children selected for IHS treatment were non-representative of the population requiring GA treatment, and that IHS was unlikely to ever be suitable for young children requiring extractions of multiple diseased teeth. Intravenous midazolam was reviewed in the case series described by <LINK REF="STD-Silay-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Silay 2013</LINK>. Study authors concluded that IV midazolam sedation was not an alternative to GA when patients had 'multiple dental management issues', that is, when they needed more than just simple dental extractions.</P>
<P>Could other methods of sedation be appropriate? Averley et al (<LINK REF="REF-Averley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Averley 2004</LINK>) demonstrated that sedation with inhaled sevoflurane and intravenous (IV) midazolam can be used to successfully provide dental treatment to a group of children and adolescents who otherwise might need GA. Again, though, investigators made no direct comparisons with GA. In a subsequent paper, this team looked at the cost of this alternative approach compared with the cost of GA (<LINK REF="REF-Jameson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jameson 2007</LINK>) and concluded that GA was 46.6% more expensive than an 'advanced' conscious sedation approach; however, data were not based on direct comparisons. Whilst one episode of dental care under sedation might be cheaper than a similar episode under GA, it is not clear if a similar level of treatment can be delivered under sedation. Dental treatment provided under sedation may require several visits for treatment completion; this is not the case for dental treatment delivered under GA. In addition, sedation may be unsuccessful on some occasions, thereby necessitating subsequent GA.  </P>
<P>So how should an RCT be designed to compare sedation versus GA? The first consideration clearly is the type of sedative technique to be used. This needs to allow provision of extractions and restorations for children and adolescents comparable with those achievable under GA. It is important to note that it also needs to allow placement of restorations that will last. GA facilitates the 'ideal' placement of restorative materials, as the patient will not move throughout the procedure. This may not be the case in a sedated patient.</P>
<P>Outcome variables must be chosen carefully. Mortality and serious morbidity following sedation or GA are rare, and sample sizes required to objectively look at these probably would be too large to allow a study to be run. However, less serious measures of morbidity (such as nausea) are common and occur frequently enough to be used as sensible outcome variables. Patient satisfaction and quality of life are important considerations. Cost is another important outcome for consideration. Sedation may well be cheaper per visit than GA, but how many sedation visits will be required to complete the treatment that will almost certainly be completed in one GA visit? Treatment quality must be assessed. As described above, sedation may not provide the optimal situation for restoration placement. <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 2013</LINK> measures some of these outcomes in adults; in this study, treatment under sedation was preferred by study participants and resulted in reduced postoperative morbidity.</P>
