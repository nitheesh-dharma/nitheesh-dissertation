<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-04 06:40:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Women with breast cancer who have multiple positive lymph nodes when first diagnosed are at high risk of recurrence. Conventional chemotherapy has limited success and is unsafe in high doses as it damages the bone marrow. One treatment considered promising was to give women very high doses of chemotherapy followed by transplantation of stem cells to regenerate their bone marrow. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence, which is current to October 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 14 randomised controlled trials (5600 women) which compared high-dose chemotherapy versus conventional chemotherapy in women with early breast cancer and with a high risk of recurrence. We defined these as women with breast cancer that has spread to multiple local lymph nodes without any evidence of spread beyond local lymph nodes.</P>
<P>All studies reported their source of funding. Eight studies were funded by non-profit organisations, one by a public health insurance company, one by industry sources and four by a combination of non-profit organisations and industry sources. Four of the studies reported that authors had no potential conflict of interest, six reported that one or more of their authors had received some kind of support from pharmaceutical companies, and four did not mention whether any of their authors had any potential conflict of interest.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Using high-dose chemotherapy has little or no effect on increasing survival. Although rates of event-free survival were higher in the high-dose arm over three-year follow-up, this effect was not apparent at longer follow-up. Treatment-related deaths were much more common in the high-dose group. Side-effects were also more common and more severe in the high-dose group. We did not find an effect on the number of women developing second cancers.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of high quality.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-01 22:54:56 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2015), EMBASE (1980 to October 2015), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Search Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov on the 21 October 2015.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-21 10:18:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors selected RCTs, independently extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We combined data using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. Outcomes were survival rates, toxicity and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-02 16:45:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>We included 14 RCTs of 5600 women randomised to receive high-dose chemotherapy and autograft (bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue) versus chemotherapy without autograft for women with early poor prognosis breast cancer. The studies were at low risk of bias in most areas.</P>
<P>There is high-quality evidence that high-dose chemotherapy does not increase the likelihood of overall survival at any stage of follow-up (at three years: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 795 women, I² = 56%; at five years: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04, 9 RCTs, 3948 women, I² = 0%; at six years: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, 1 RCT, 511 women; at eight years: RR1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.43, 1 RCT, 344 women; at 12 years: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.42, 1 RCT, 382 women).</P>
<P>There is high-quality evidence that high-dose chemotherapy improves the likelihood of event-free survival at three years (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 795 women, I² = 56%) but this effect was no longer apparent at longer duration of follow-up (at five years: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.09, 9 RCTs, 3948 women, I² = 14%; at six years RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24, 1 RCT, 511 women; at eight years: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64, 1 RCT, 344 women; at 12 years: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.45, 1 RCT, 382 women).</P>
<P>Treatment-related deaths were much more frequent in the high-dose arm (RR 7.97, 95% CI 3.99 to 15.92, 14 RCTs, 5600 women, I² = 12%, high-quality evidence) and non-fatal morbidity was also more common and more severe in the high-dose group. There was little or no difference between the groups in the incidence of second cancers at four to nine years' median follow-up (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.73, 7 RCTs, 3423 women, I² = 0%, high-quality evidence). Women in the high-dose group reported significantly worse quality-of-life scores immediately after treatment, but there were few statistically significant differences between the groups by one year.</P>
<P>The primary studies were at low risk of bias in most areas, and the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods and rated as high quality for all comparisons.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-01 21:49:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-01 21:49:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women and is the primary cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Its incidence is increasing in most countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2004</LINK>). The lifetime risk of a woman developing breast cancer is about one in eight in the United States and one in nine in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In women with early breast cancer, all detectable cancer is restricted to the breast or local lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2008</LINK>). Women who have multiple positive lymph nodes when they are first diagnosed are at high risk of recurrent disease. Without adjuvant chemotherapy, the median recurrence rate at five years is over 60% for women with four to nine positive nodes and over 70% for women with more than 10 positive nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Nemoto-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemoto 1980</LINK>). Established chemotherapy regimens have a high failure rate, improving the chance of 10-year survival by about 11% for women under 50 and about 3% for older women (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-30 21:03:36 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers from the 1970s onwards described a dose-response relationship in the action of chemotherapy drugs against cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Frei-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frei 1980</LINK>); thus it was observed that in the treatment of breast cancer the percentage of women responding to therapy is positively associated with the dose intensity of the drugs received, dose intensity being a function of both the dose and the timing of the chemotherapy regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hryniuk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hryniuk 1986</LINK>). The technique of autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant (autograft) was considered an exciting development because it addressed the problem of bone-marrow toxicity which had previously limited the dose of chemotherapy drugs that could be safely given. The use of autograft with chemotherapy permitted the administration of doses many times higher than could otherwise be used. Results of animal studies were encouraging, as were non-randomised patient trials which commenced during the 1980s and which achieved prolonged survival times using high-dose chemotherapy and autograft for women with advanced breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peters-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-03 16:18:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from non-randomised studies has been criticised for participant selection bias and other design weaknesses (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 1992</LINK>). The first randomised trials began in 1991. Several randomised controlled trials have now been carried out among women with early poor prognosis breast cancer, which is defined as breast cancer that has spread to multiple local lymph nodes without any evidence of distant metastases (spread). The aim of this review was to consider these studies with respect to the relative effectiveness and safety of the treatments they compare.</P>

<P>For the 2015 review update, two review authors (JM and MA or AL) undertook study selection, and independently screened all articles retrieved by the search. Three review authors (JM, MA or AL and CF) independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>For previous versions of the review, three review authors (CF, RB and JMB), one of whom (RB) is a content expert, had undertaken study selection. CF screened the titles and abstracts of articles found in the search, and discarded studies that were clearly ineligible; however, the aim was to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. CF obtained copies of the full-text articles and made copies for RB in which details of the authors and institutions were struck out and the Results section removed: however, despite this RB was able to recognise the studies since this is such a small field in terms of publications. We sought further information from the authors of the primary studies where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risks of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org">www.cochrane-handbook.org</A>) to assess: selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective reporting); and other bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by recourse to a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table, which was incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity by inspecting the scatter in the data points on the graphs and the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking the I² value (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This measure describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Interpretation of a given degree of heterogeneity will differ according to whether the estimates show the same direction of effect but we planned to interpret the I² measure as follows: 0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was considerable variation among the chemotherapy regimens used. Most of the trials delivered an initial course of chemotherapy at conventional doses to all women. This served as an 'induction' course to women in the high-dose groups, who went on to receive a high-dose myeloablative regimen followed by the infusion of stem cells to 'rescue' the bone marrow. In some cases women in the control arms went on to have additional cycles of conventional-dose chemotherapy and in other cases the conventional treatment was modified in some way to increase the strength or intensity of the dose (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>).

Two gave multiple cycles of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin only (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">GABG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>), and one (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>) used four cycles of doxorubicin alone for the initial chemotherapy. Doses in the control arm varied: see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. During this initial phase of chemotherapy, women randomised to receive the high-dose treatment had a course of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) to stimulate the production of white cells which were then harvested for later transplantation.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The control arm</LI>
</UL>
<P>In five of the trials the women in the control arm had no further chemotherapy after the initial phase mentioned above. In two (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK>) the control arm had a continuation of the initial chemotherapy. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GABG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">GABG 2004</LINK>) they received a standard course of a different chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF). The control arm in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>) were given an "intermediate level" version of the high-dose therapy along with a course of GCSF to stimulate white cell production. In another (<LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>) they had a dose-dense regimen supported by GCSF, comprising two further cycles of the initial chemotherapy followed by three cycles of CMF, all at two-week intervals.</P>
<P>In three trials where the two arms did not have any of their treatment in common, the control arm received two combination therapies in sequence: in the Italian trial (<LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>) the control arm received three cycles of epirubicin followed by six of CMF; in the <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK> trial they received four cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by three cycles of CMF. In <LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK> the control group received sequential dose-dense and dose-escalated chemotherapy consisting of three cycles of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide, with filgrastim support. The study authors noted that this regimen is non-standard.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The experimental arm</LI>
</UL>
<P>In most studies, after the initial chemotherapy described above, the experimental arm went on to receive one or two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. The high-dose therapy for most trials comprised cyclophosphamide with thiotepa or etoposide or carmustine, with or without a platinum-based drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) or mitoxantrone. Doses varied: see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<P>As noted above, three studies differed in design by giving different initial chemotherapy to the experimental arm. In one (<LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>) the experimental arm had a sequence of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, epirubicin and thiotepa with melphalan, all at high doses, and in the second (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>) they had three cycles of high-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide; in the third (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK>) they received four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.</P>
<P>In all cases high-dose therapy was supported by autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation or both, using the cells or marrow harvested during the initial phase of chemotherapy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Radiotherapy</LI>
</UL>
<P>All women in 10 of the trials received a course of loco-regional radiotherapy after chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-pilot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch pilot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-01-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 01 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>), and this was introduced as a protocol change in another study (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">GABG 2004</LINK>). In the Italian trial (<LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>) only women who had had conservative surgery received radiotherapy, and in another (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>) it was mandatory after breast-conserving surgery but recommended for all women. The Japanese trial (<LINK REF="STD-JCOG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">JCOG 2001</LINK>) did not include radiotherapy as part of the protocol.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tamoxifen</LI>

<P>Trial protocols for tamoxifen varied. It was prescribed for all women in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-pilot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch pilot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JCOG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">JCOG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>).

<P>All studies measured overall survival (i.e. survival with or without recurrence), and all specified the number of deaths caused by treatment toxicity.</P>
<P>All studies measured event-free survival (i.e. survival without breast cancer recurrence).

Most of the deaths in this study were caused by acute infection, pulmonary toxicity or renal failure (haemolytic-uraemic syndrome). However there were also three late treatment-related deaths, one due to acute myeloid leukaemia secondary to treatment and two due to pulmonary fibrosis. There were five treatment-related deaths in the high-dose arm in the <LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK> study, four related to infection and one to pulmonary fibrosis (5/307).

<P>Five studies described the adverse effects of conventional-dose chemotherapy (which was given to all women in these studies), and also described the additional toxicity experienced by women who went on to receive high-dose therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-pilot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch pilot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK>). Three studies compared toxicity between the control and high-dose arms (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>). Another study, in which the women in the two arms had no treatment in common (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>), compared the worst toxic effects experienced by the two arms. The German study (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">GABG 2004</LINK>) systematically registered toxicity only in the high-dose arm.</P>
<P>Toxicity was much higher in the high-dose group, notably (as expected) neutropenia, often accompanied by fever and infection. The <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-pilot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch pilot 1998</LINK> study was the only one to report on the length of the hospital inpatient stay for high-dose therapy: 90% of women required up to 18 days in hospital after transplantation to allow their bone marrow to regenerate.</P>
<P>Classic treatment side-effects such as fatigue, vomiting, mucositis and diarrhoea were common with both regimens, although all were more common and more severe with high-dose treatment. Two studies mentioned hair loss, which was universal in the high-dose groups. High-dose therapy was also more likely to induce menopause. Three studies mentioned that about 75% to 80% of women in the high-dose arm and 60% of women in the control arm were postmenopausal after therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-01-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 01 2003</LINK>), while another noted that all women in the high-dose arm became amenorrhoeic (<LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>). All premenopausal participants in <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK> became amenorrhoeic after chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Organ toxicities affected more women in the high-dose arms; these included cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, bladder, skin and neurological complications. Most of these toxicities were not severe and were reversible; one study reported no major organ toxicities in either arm (<LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>). However, some toxicities were fatal, as described above, and in addition there were a number of women who suffered ongoing treatment-related morbidities such as peripheral neuropathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis and radiation-induced pneumonitis; such long-term complications affected women in both groups but were more common in the high-dose group. See <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>Several trials compared the incidence of second primary malignancies in women from the two trial arms at variable durations of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-pilot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch pilot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK>). These included second breast cancers and haematological malignancies as well as other types of cancer. A meta-analysis of these results showed no significant difference between the two arms in the incidence of second cancers at a median of four to nine years of follow-up (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.73, 7 RCTs, 3423 women, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Quality of Life</HEADING>
<P>Women from five of the trials took part in related quality-of-life studies (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-01-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 01 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>) and in addition a subset of women drawn from both Dutch trials participated in a study of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.<BR/>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK> study analysed quality-of-life data relating to 84 women on the high-dose treatment arm and 82 on the standard-dose arm. There was no significant difference between the groups: at six months women in both arms of the trial reported a significant deterioration in quality of life, but at one year both groups reported a quality of life very similar to the pre-treatment baseline. Both groups were significantly less tense and worried at follow-up assessments than they were at baseline. At five years the investigators reported that quality of life associated with high-dose therapy was only transiently lower than that associated with conventional dose therapy. More detailed analysis is planned.</P>
<P>A subset of 210 women from the <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK> trial was enrolled in a companion quality-of-life study, using telephone-based questionnaires. The high-dose group reported significantly worse overall quality of life at three months, but the difference between the groups narrowed until there was minimal difference among survivors at one year. Quality of life improved in both groups over the follow-up time.</P>
<P>Quality of life data were also available from 96 women in the <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK> trial. Again, quality of life scores were worse in the high-dose arm but recovered by three weeks after the second cycle of high-dose therapy. This outcome was not followed up beyond that point.</P>
<P>Women participating in the <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK> trial were sent regular quality-of-life questionnaires which were completed for at least four years by 58 women in the conventional arm and 46 in the high-dose arm. The high-dose arm scored significantly lower on several measures just after chemotherapy, but there was no significant difference between the arms six months later. Scores improved consistently in both arms over time with no significant difference between them. However, at four years more than 20% of women in both groups reported fatigue, sore muscles, decreased sexual interest and sweating as adverse effects of therapy.</P>
<P>A further study in the <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK> trial surveyed 413 women three years after chemotherapy. There was no difference between the two arms in their mean vitality score at one, two or three years, and their scores never fell below those of the reference population. Women in the high-dose arm had a slightly lower haemoglobin level during the three years following chemotherapy, but overall this did not correlate well with reports of fatigue: 81% of women reporting fatigue did not have a low haemoglobin.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-01-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 01 2003</LINK> trialists found that women in the high-dose arm recorded a strong deterioration in quality of life during treatment and that physical functioning was significantly better for women in the control arm. At three months after completion of radiotherapy the differences between the two arms had disappeared. However, at one year follow-up women in the high-dose arm had physical and functional scores below their baseline values, which were significantly lower than the scores of women in the control arm.</P>
<P>The effect of chemotherapy on cognitive functioning was evaluated in a report in which 102 women took part, 34 from the high-dose arm of either one of the Dutch trials, 34 from the standard-dose arm of the same trials, and 34 from a control group of women with stage I breast cancer not treated with chemotherapy. Psychoneurological tests administered at a median of two years after treatment showed cognitive impairment in 32% of the high-dose group, 17% of the standard-dose group and 9% of the control group. The difference between the high-dose group and the control group was statistically significant (P = 0.006) but the difference between the high-dose arm and the standard-dose group was not (P = 0.056). It was observed that the women who reported cognitive problems were not necessarily the same ones who were objectively identified as being cognitively impaired, and that self-reported cognitive problems were more related to anxiety, depression and psychological distress. At four years the tests were repeated with a subset of the original participants and the results suggested that cognitive dysfunction after chemotherapy may be transient; however, there was a high attrition rate of initially cognitively impaired women in the high-dose arm.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Statistical heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We noted moderate or high statistical heterogeneity in two instances: namely, event-free survival and overall survival at three years. In both cases the results of <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK> differed in direction from those of other trials, although the 95% confidence interval overlapped the confidence interval of the summary effect measure. When <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK> was omitted from the meta-analyses, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity. It is unclear why the results of <LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK> were relatively less favourable for the high-dose arm; however, it was the smallest trial in the review, which limits the strength of its findings.</P>

<LI>Chemotherapy regimen:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over half of the treatment-related deaths were in <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>, which noted that deaths occurred more frequently in centres that did fewer than 50 transplants. It was one of only two studies to use carmustine as part of the high-dose regimen. It differed from the other studies in that women in the conventional arm of the study were given their final cycle of chemotherapy at an "intermediate" dose with GCSF (growth factor) support, and has been described as "a comparison between high and intermediate dose" chemotherapy regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1992</LINK>). Excluding <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK> from the analysis did not change the statistical significance of any of the results.<BR/>
<BR/>As noted above, there was considerable variation between the chemotherapy regimens used. We conducted sensitivity analyses omitting firstly studies that used upfront high-dose chemotherapy with no induction cycles for the high dose group (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001</LINK>), and secondly studies where the 'conventional' chemotherapy was modified in some way to increase the strength or intensity of the dose (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MCG 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-NCT00002772" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00002772</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-21 11:47:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These studies tested the hypothesis that women with early poor prognosis breast cancer would benefit from treatment with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow or stem cell support. There was statistically significant evidence of increased event-free survival for women in the high-dose group at three year follow-up, but there was no good evidence of a difference between the groups at other time points. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in overall survival rates at any stage of follow-up and in fact there was evidence of harm, with greater numbers of treatment-related deaths and adverse events occurring in the high-dose arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK> dominates the results with respect to treatment-related deaths: the increased mortality is thought to have occurred because of the pulmonary and hepatic toxicity of carmustine used in this study and the relative inexperience of some transplant centres. However, sensitivity analysis excluding this trial did not negate the statistical significance of the results for this outcome, which continued to favour the group that received conventional chemotherapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-02 00:01:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many researchers have suggested that while most studies have not demonstrated an overall benefit, there may be subgroups that benefit from high-dose therapy. The <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK> study reported improved event-free survival at five years in women with more than 10 positive nodes in the high-dose arm that was of borderline statistical significance by the log-rank test (P = 0.05, hazard ratio for relapse 0.71 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.0)). However, two of the other studies in this review reported survival rates for women with at least 10 nodes at five and six years respectively, and neither showed any statistically significant advantage for the high-dose group (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2003</LINK>). Nor did subgroup analyses of women with 10 or more positive lymph nodes in two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>) find any statistically significant survival benefit for the high-dose group.</P>
<P>Unplanned subgroup analyses in the <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK> study unexpectedly showed a statistically significant benefit in event-free survival for women in the high-dose group with lower expression of the HER2/neu gene, which is associated with cell division (P = 0.002 at five-year follow-up). Younger age and lower histological grade were also associated with more responsiveness to high-dose chemotherapy in this study. Retrospective analysis of data from the German study (<LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK>) found that younger women with large higher-grade tumours benefited most from high-dose treatment in their study, although subgroups were very small. More recently, this group has proposed a specific biomarker (Y-box binding protein YB-1) as a method of identifying women who might benefit from high-dose chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gluz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluz 2009</LINK>). As the authors noted, their subgroup analyses were unplanned (and therefore must be viewed with caution), but may indicate promising areas for investigation. No evidence of a difference between the groups was reported in other subgroup analyses of baseline prognostic factors such as age, tumour size and grade, menopausal status, surgery type and hormone receptor status (<LINK REF="STD-ACCOG-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ACCOG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-2006" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also the question of statistical power. Are these 14 trials of over 5000 women sufficient to answer the question of effectiveness? In order to detect a 10% improvement in event-free survival (estimating that 50% of women with early poor prognosis breast cancer will progress without additional treatment by five years, which would decrease to 40% with treatment), it would be necessary to recruit 407 women to each arm of the study with 95% confidence of detecting a difference with 80% power. Therefore, the total number of women in this systematic review is sufficient to detect a difference by five years, and at least one of the individual studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK>) has the statistical power to detect a 10% difference However, as noted below, five years of follow-up may not be long enough to reach a conclusion about the relative efficacy of treatments.</P>
<P>Is it appropriate to pool the results of these 14 studies? They randomised women with differing prognoses, in particular with respect to their number of positive lymph nodes. There was also variability in the chemotherapy regimens used. However, inspection of the forest plots shows very little heterogeneity except for three-year survival outcomes, which were influenced by the differing findings of the smallest trial in the review (<LINK REF="STD-MDACC-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MDACC 2000</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis excluding studies with lower-risk participants(fewer than 10 nodes) negated the statistically significant benefit shown for high-dose therapy in event-free survival rates at three years. This was probably due to reduced power in the meta-analysis rather than clinical differences in the participants, since there was no statistical heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses allowing for these differences did not change the statistical significance of any other results. Thus it would appear that pooling the results of the studies was appropriate.</P>
<P>Although high-dose chemotherapy with autograft is associated with considerable morbidity and its role in the treatment of breast cancer has not yet been fully defined, it has often been viewed as a worthwhile treatment for women with poor prognosis or advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nieto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto 2000</LINK>). As a result, many women in the USA were treated outside of a clinical trial: data from the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry suggest that in the USA during the 1990s over 40,000 women with breast cancer received this treatment, yet fewer than 1000 were recruited to clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-ABMTR-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABMTR 2002</LINK>). This review underscores the need for randomised controlled trials as the only reliable method of establishing effective treatments for women with breast cancer.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-02 00:03:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the primary studies in this review were at low risk of bias in all but one of the domains assessed. The exception was blinding, which appears unlikely to influence our outcomes of interest. Many of the findings were based on estimated data as study follow-up was not complete in all women, but findings were largely consistent across trials and it appears unlikely that further data will change the overall finding.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was high for all comparisons. There was no serious indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision or evidence of publication bias.</P>
<P>However, the <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2003</LINK> trialists noted that subgroup analysis excluding women with minor protocol violations showed a longer time to recurrence in the high-dose group, and they also commented, as did the <LINK REF="STD-WSG-2005" TYPE="STUDY">WSG 2005</LINK> trialists, on an apparent late divergence in survival rates. Extended follow-up will be important to determine whether such differences persist or increase. The <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Intergp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Intergp 2003</LINK> trialists suggested that additional follow-up of five to 10 years might be required before a definitive conclusion about overall survival could be made.
