<P>Although corticosteroids are effective for treating Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients who respond become sick again when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. TNF alpha is a chemical that causes some of the inflammation of Crohn's disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blocking drugs may provide an alternate treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. This review shows that a single intravenous infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg) may be an effective treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease who no longer respond to corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. There is also some evidence that CDP571, another TNF alpha blocking drug may be effective. There is no evidence to support the use of etanercept, a drug that blocks the action of TNF alpha by binding to receptors. There were no serious side effects associated with TNF blocking drugs, although the follow-up period of the studies reported in this review may have been too short to assess the development of serious side effects.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids, enteral nutrition and immuno-suppressive agents. A number of patients with the disease may also become steroid-dependent leading to increased risk of developing steroid-related adverse effects. Recent studies suggest that TNF-a blocking agents may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of TNF-a blocking agents in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966-June 2003), EMBASE (1984-June 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003) and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomised controlled trials in which patients with active Crohn's disease (defined by a validated Crohn's disease activity index) were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-a blocking agent in the treatment arm , or to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. Outcome measures reported in the primary studies included clinical remission, clinical response and changes in disease activity index. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten studies were identified of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies either differed in the type of TNF-a blocking agent used or in the way outcomes were assessed to such an extent that we considered it inappropriate to combine the data statistically. There is evidence from one randomised controlled trial that suggests that a single intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab, may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There was no difference in response rates among infliximab doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg. The results of two other trials suggested that CDP571, the genetically engineered human TNF monoclonal antibody, may also be effective in reducing disease activity index at 2 weeks after an infusion. We did not find any evidence to support the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence from one randomized controlled trial suggests that a single infusion of infliximab may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Based on this study, we can recommend a dose of 5 mg/kg. There is also some evidence that CDP571 may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. We did not find any evidence that supports the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. The period of follow up for the patients in these studies was probably too short to allow adequate assessment of recently reported serious adverse effects such as tuberculosis and lymphoma.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease is a transmural inflammatory disorder which can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract and which is characterised by chronicity, recurrences and numerous complications. There is no cure for Crohn's disease and treatment regimens are directed toward inducing remission, maintaining remission and addressing complications.</P>
<P>The cause of Crohn's disease is not known. The pathogenesis of the disorder may involve the interaction of three essential co-factors; host susceptibility, enteric microflora, and mucosal immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Shanahan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shanahan 2001</LINK>). Susceptibility loci for the disease have been reported on chromosomes 16, 3, 7, and 12 (<LINK REF="REF-Rampton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampton 1999</LINK>). Claims for initiating roles for several environmental factors such as food constituents, or specific infectious agents have not yet been substantiated. </P>
<P>Whatever the initiating factors in Crohn's disease, excessive activation of mucosal T cells leads to transmural inflammation, which is amplified and perpetuated by increased release of proinflammatory cytokines by the intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bauditz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauditz 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rampton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampton 1999</LINK>). Crohn's disease is associated with type 1 helper T cells (Th1) cytokines, such as interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-12 (<LINK REF="REF-Shanahan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shanahan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>TNF-a is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that can elicit a wide spectrum of organismal and cellular responses such as fever, shock, tissue injury, tumor necrosis, induction of other cytokines and immunoregulatory molecules, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Papadikas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadikas 2000</LINK>). Several studies have shown that TNF-a production is increased in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reimund-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reimund 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Breese-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breese 1994</LINK>). Increased TNF-a concentrations have also been reported in the serum of patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murch 1991</LINK>). In vitro studies show that TNF-a can induce a host of proinflammatory effector events which may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. These include neutrophil accumulation, granuloma formation, upregulation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, procoagulant effects, induction of increased intestinal permeability and also direct cytopathic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bauditz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauditz 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Infliximab, a neutralizing mouse/human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 chimeric anti human tumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody was the first biological response modifier to be used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Infliximab has been shown to neutralize TNF-a effects both in vitro and in vivo by blocking soluble TNF-a and binding to transmembrane TNF-a (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Scallon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scallon 1995</LINK>). A number of studies have demonstrated clinical or endoscopic benefits of infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease refractory to corticosteroids or conventional immunosuppressive drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Baert--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baert 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>). Infliximab has been licensed for the treatment of Crohn's disease in both North America and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2000</LINK>). The genetically engineered human monoclonal antibody to IgG4 anti-TNF-a antibody, CDP571, has also been clinically evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>), but is not yet licensed for use. As TNF-a exerts its effects by binding to two specific transmembrane receptors p55 and p75, recent studies have also investigated the use of a p75-TNF receptor fusion protein, etanercept (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>), and a p-55-TNF receptor fusion protein, onercept (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2003</LINK>) in the treatment of acute Crohn's disease. </P>
<P>TNF-a antibody treatment is expensive with each 5 mg/kg infusion of infliximab costing about £1600 (UK) for a patient weighing 70 kg. The total number of participants in some of the controlled trials has been small with one study having 31 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>). A systematic review is indicated to summarise the current evidence on the use of TNF-a antibody for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The potential use of TNF-a blocking agents for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease and treatment of fistulizing disease are not the subject of the current review and should be subjected to separate systematic reviews.</P>

<P>Similar search strategies, but modified appropriately, and using the above keywords were used to search the other electronic databases listed above.</P>
<P>B. Reference searching<BR/>The references of all identified studies were inspected for more trials. </P>
<P>C. Abstracts of major gastroenterology meetings <BR/>We originally intended to do a manual search of abstracts submitted to major gastroenterology meetings between 1995-2003, but after looking at a few of such abstracts, it was not possible to assess the methodological qualities of these studies. Since there is also some evidence that data from abstracts can be inconsistent from data in the full article (<LINK REF="REF-Pitkin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitkin 1999</LINK>), we decided to exclude data published only in abstract form from further consideration.</P>
<P>D. Personal contacts<BR/>Leaders in the field were contacted to try to identify other studies. </P>
<P>E. Drug companies<BR/>The manufacturers of infliximab and CDP571 were contacted for additional data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Step 1. Using the above search strategy, papers (or abstracts) that appear potentially relevant were identified by the reviewers.</P>
<P>Step 2. The reviewers, after reading the full texts independently assessed the eligibility of all trials identified using an ad hoc eligibility based on the inclusion criteria above.</P>
<P>Step 3. The methodological quality of selected trials was assessed independently by two reviewers using the criteria described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>) and the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect. The categories are defined below:<BR/>A. adequate allocation concealment<BR/>B. allocation concealment unclear<BR/>C. inadequate allocation concealment</P>
<P>The Jadad scale is a validated five point scale which measures a wide range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. This is summarised below:<BR/>a. was the study described as randomised? (yes=1 point, No =0)<BR/>b. was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (yes=1 point, No =0)<BR/>c. was the study described as double blind? (yes=1 point, No =0)<BR/>d. was the double blinding well described and appropriate? (yes=1 point, No =0)<BR/>e. were withdrawals and dropouts described? (yes=1 point, No =0)<BR/> <BR/>Disagreement among reviewers was discussed and agreement reached by consensus.</P>
<P>DATA COLLECTION<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract information on relevant features and results of included studies. Two reviewers separately extracted and recorded data on the predefined checklist. Extracted data included the following items:</P>
<P>a. Characteristics of patients: age, sex, disease distribution, disease duration, disease activity index;<BR/>b. Total number of patients originally assigned to each treatment group (to allow an intention to treat analysis);<BR/>c. Intervention: type of tumour necrosis factor alpha antibody, dose, schedule of treatment, route of administration;<BR/>d. Control: placebo, other drugs;<BR/>e. Concurrent medications;<BR/>f. Outcomes: time of assessment, type of Crohn's disease activity index used, definition of remission, remission rates, and adverse events. </P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<BR/>Studies were first reviewed to assess the statistical validity of combining the results of the various trials. Data were analysed according to the intention to treat principle, using as the denominator, the total number of patients randomised. There was not enough data to allow any subgroup analyses based on age of participants, disease location, type of tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking agent, or the use of concurrent medication.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified ten randomised controlled trials on the use of tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking agents in Crohn's disease. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Present-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1999</LINK>) were excluded because they did not describe the use of TNF-a blocking agents for induction of remission. <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK> were excluded because they only described the use of TNF-a agents for maintenance of remission. <LINK REF="STD-Present-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1999</LINK> was excluded because the study was on the use of infliximab for treatment of fistulas. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK> was excluded as a primary study because it was a subgroup analysis of an earlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>). The findings of <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK> are, however, described. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baldassano-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldassano 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2003</LINK>) were excluded because they did not compare TNF-a blocking agents with either placebo or another treatment but rather compared different doses of infliximab (<LINK REF="STD-Baldassano-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldassano 2003</LINK>), and different doses of recombinant human soluble p55 TNF receptor (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>), and these were included in the review. All the included papers primarily compared TNF-a preparations with placebo for induction of remission in active intestinal Crohn's disease refractory to conventional treatment. In one of the included studies, the TNF-a agent used was the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>); two studies used an engineered human antibody to TNF (CDP51) {<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>} , and the fourth study examined the human soluble TNF receptor :Fc fusion protein (etanercept) {<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>}. Infliximab and CDP571 were administered as single doses of intravenous infusions whilst etanercept was given as a twice weekly subcutaneous infusion. In all the studies, the diagnosis of Crohn's disease had been established by standard clinical, radiologic, endoscopic or histologic criteria. Study participants in all the included studies were adults (aged&gt; 18 years). In all the trials, patient eligibility for inclusion in the trial was based on the conventional Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) which was also used to define remission, clinical response or changes in disease activity. </P>
<P>STUDY ON INFLIXIMAB <BR/>We identified one randomised controlled trial on infliximab (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>). This study compared a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of infliximab with placebo. A subgroup analysis of the same study was subsequently reported by <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>
<BR/>One hundred and eight patients (55 men, 53 women; age range 26-46 years) were recruited from 18 centres in North America and Europe. All patients had active Crohn's disease (CDAI between 220 and 400). They were randomised to receive a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of infliximab (n=83) or placebo (n=25). The doses of infliximab received by the 83 patients in the infliximab group were 5 mg/kg (n=27), 10 mg/kg (n=28) and 20 mg/kg (n=28). Patients who were already receiving aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine or mercaptopurine before the study continued to receive a stable dose during the trial period. Outcome measures were ''clinical response'' defined as a reduction of 70 points or more in the CDAI score at 4 weeks after the infusion, and clinical remission defined as a CDAI less than 150. </P>
<P>In a subgroup analysis of the same study, <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK> reported changes in Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index Score (CDEIS) from baseline after 4 weeks in a 30 patient subset of the cohort (infliximab, n=22; placebo, n=8) who also underwent colonoscopy and ileoscopy before the infusion and 4 weeks after infusion.</P>
<P>STUDIES ON CDP571 <BR/>We identified two randomised controlled trials on the use of CDP571 for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>). Both studies compared a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of CDP571 with placebo in adults. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>
<BR/>Thirty one patients (15 men, 16 women) were recruited from the U.K. All patients had active Crohn's disease (CDAI between 150 and 400). Patients were allowed to enter the study if they received at least a one month stable dose of azathioprine (2 mg/kg or less); a 1 week or more stable dose of mesalazine (&lt;/ 2.4 g); or prednisolone (&lt;10 mg daily and stable for &gt;/ 2 weeks). They were randomised to receive either a single 1-hour intravenous infusion of CDP571 (Celltech Therapeutics, Slough, UK) at a dose of 5 mg/kg (n=21) or placebo (n=10). The primary outcome measure was clinical remission rate defined as a CDAI &lt; 150 at 2 weeks after the infusion. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 169 patients (86 men, 83 women; aged &gt;18 years) with active Crohn's disease (CDAI between 220 and 400) were recruited from 21 centres in the Unites States, Canada and Great Britain. Patients receiving 10-30 mg/day of prednisolone for at least 4 weeks, those receiving 9 mg/day of budesonide for at least 2 weeks, and those receiving stable doses of azathioprine (&gt;/1.5 mg/kg/day) and 6-mercaptopurine (&gt;/ 0.75 mg/kg/day) for at least 4 months, or methotrexate (&gt;/ 15 mg/week) were allowed to enter the study as well as those receiving 5-aminosalicylates provided the dose had been stable for at least 3 months. They were initially randomised to receive a single intravenous infusion of CDP571 (n=111) or placebo (n=58). The doses of CDP571 received by the 111 patients in the CDP571 group were 10 mg/kg (n=54), and 20 mg/kg (n=57). Two patients in the placebo group did not undergo at least one efficacy evaluation after receiving the study medication and were excluded from the analysis. The primary outcome measure was clinical response defined as a decrease in baseline CDAI score of more than or equal to 70 points at week 2. After the two weeks, participants were subsequently given 8 or 12 weekly infusions of either 10 mg/kg CDP571 (for those originally given CDP571 or placebo (for those originally randomised to placebo) and followed up for another 22 weeks. </P>
<P>STUDY ON ETANERCEPT <BR/>One RCT was identified on etanercept (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 43 patients (26 men, 17 women; aged 20-69) with active Crohn's disease as defined by a score of 220 to 450 on the CDAI were randomised to receive either twice weekly etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously (n=23) or placebo (n=20). The patients were recruited from 6 centres in the United States. Patients receiving prednisone or budesonide for at least 4 weeks with a stable dose for at least 2 weeks were allowed into the study. Those receiving stable doses of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for at least 12 weeks, or methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil for at least 8 weeks were also eligible. The main outcome measures were rates of clinical response (defined as decrease in baseline CDAI more or equal to 70 points or a CDAI score less than 150 at week 4), and rates of clinical remission (CDAI score &lt;150 points at week 4). </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In all the 4 included studies, allocation of participants to intervention or placebo was random and allocation concealment was adequate. The methodological quality of each trial was further assessed using the validated five point Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Two studies were given scores of 5 out 5 on the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>); another study scored 4 out of 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>); and the fourth study scored 3 out of 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>). </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We identified 4 randomized placebo-controlled trials on the use of anti TNF-a agents for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The participants of all the included studies were adults (aged &gt;18 years). As described above, the studies used different types of anti TNF-a agents (infliximab in one study, CDP571 in two studies and etanercept in one study). The outcome measures described were different for the two studies on CDP571. In addition, one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>) defined disease activity with a lower CDAI (150 - 400). Thus because of the different types of anti-TNF-a agents used, different disease activity definitions, and the use of different outcome measures, we considered it inappropriate to combine the data statistically. The results of the individual studies are therefore described below. There were insufficient data in the primary studies to allow a subgroup analysis according to disease location, or disease duration.</P>
<P>INFLIXIMAB VERSUS PLACEBO</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>
<BR/>A similar number of patients in each group had been treated with corticosteroids, mercaptopurine, azathioprine and aminosalicylates at baseline. Four weeks after the infusion, 27 of 83 patients in the infliximab group vs 1 of 25 patients in the placebo group were in remission (RR 8.1, 95% Confidence Interval 1.2 - 56.9; NNT 4 (95% CI, 3-9)). Fifty four of 83 patients in the infliximab group vs 4 of 25 in the placebo achieved clinical response (RR 4.1, 95% Confidence Interval 1.6 - 10.1). No dose-response relation was seen at 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a clinical response at 4 weeks were subsequently enrolled in a parallel, open label study and received an infusion of 10 mg/kg of infliximab and were followed for 12 additional weeks. Adverse events reported were for the beginning of the trial to the end of the additional 12 week period for the subsequent open label study. These included headaches, nausea, fatigue, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infections, chest pain, pruritis, and vomiting. The proportions of adverse events in patients receiving a single infusion of infliximab over the whole period was similar in the infliximab and placebo groups. In addition, one patient in the placebo group developed an abdominal abscess whilst one patient in the infliximab group developed salmonella colitis. Of the 29 patients who ended up receiving two doses of infliximab, 2 had a reaction (chest pain, dyspnea, or nausea) that led to the discontinuation of the infusion. These reactions settled spontaneously within minutes of stopping the infusion. </P>
<P>In the subgroup analysis subsequently reported by <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK>, mean CDEIS in the infliximab group statistically significantly decreased from 13.0+/-7.1 to 5.3+/-4.4 (p&lt;0.001). No dose-related effect was observed. No significant change in mean CDEIS (changed from 8.4+/-6.3 to 7.5 +/-5.4) was observed in the placebo group. Changes in CDEIS showed a statistically significant correlation with changes in the CDAI (r=0.56, p=0.002).</P>
<P>CDP571 VERSUS PLACEBO</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>
<BR/>The proportions of participants receiving prednisolone, azathioprine and a combination of azathioprine and prednisolone were similar in the two groups. Six of 21 patients receiving CDP571 achieved remission compared with none of the 10 patients in the placebo group (RR 6.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 105.2). The median CDAI in the CDP571 statistically significantly fell from 263 (IQR 186.5 - 323.5) to 167 (137.5 - 294.0); p=0.0003 at 2 weeks. The change in median CDAI for the placebo group from 253 (240 - 334) to 247 (183 - 256) was not statistically significant. Five of 21 participants in the CDP571 group reported mild adverse reactions such as dizziness, abdominal pain and increased flatus but 4 of the 10 placebo recipients also experienced similar symptoms. Seven patients in the CDP571 developed elevation of CDP571 antibodies, but none of them developed an allergic reaction during the study period. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>
<BR/>Clinical response defined as a decrease in baseline CDAI score of more than or equal to 70 points at week 2 was achieved in 50 of 111 patients in the CDP571 group compared with 15 of 56 in the placebo group (RR 1.7, 95% Confidence Interval 1.0 - 2.7; NNT 6, 95% CI, 4 - 39). Rates of fistula closure between the two groups were not statistically significant (12/24 in the CDP571 group vs 2/13 in the placebo group, p=0.074). At 24 weeks, clinical remission rates for the placebo and CDP571 groups were 4% and 11% respectively (not statistically significant) for those receiving 8 weekly infusions, and 3% and 11% respectively for those receiving 12 weekly infusions (not statistically significant). During the 24-week period, 96 of 111 patients in the CDP571 group developed some adverse reaction compared with 40 of 58 in the placebo group (p=0.008). Most of the adverse events were, however, mild and there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to serious adverse events such as infusion reactions, abscess formation and infections. Antibodies against CDP571 developed in 8 of 111 patients receiving CDP571 compared to none in the placebo group.<BR/> </P>
<P>ETANERCEPT VERSUS PLACEBO</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>
<BR/>The groups were similar with regard to rates of use of concomitant medication such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine and 5-aminosalicylates. The rates of clinical response at Week 4 (the primary outcome measure, defined as a decrease in CDAI score by 70 points or more from baseline) were similar in patients treated with etanercept compared with those treated with placebo (9 of 23 vs 9 of 20; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4 - 1.8). The rates of clinical remission at 4 weeks for the etanercept- and placebo-treated patients were also similar (2 of 23 vs 4 of 20, RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1 - 2.1). There was also no statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to rates of clinical response and clinical remission after 8 weeks. Reported adverse events included headache, injection site reactions, abdominal pain, asthenia, and skin disorders. The proportions of patients who developed these adverse events were similar in the two groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is no known cure for Crohn's disease, and treatment modalities are aimed at inducing remission, preventing relapses and addressing complications. In many patients, Crohn's disease can be refractory to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids, enteral nutrition and immune-modulators (including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate); and some patients may become dependent on corticosteroids on a long-term basis increasing their risk of developing steroid-related adverse effects. In these situations, it is important that other treatment options are considered. Recent reports have suggested that TNF blocking agents may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. In this review, we have summarised the findings of available randomised controlled trials on the subject. The main outcomes reported by all the included studies were related to clinical response or clinical remission as measured by validated instruments. Short term adverse events were reported but the follow-up periods were too short to allow assessment of long term complications of the treatment. </P>
<P>Evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests that infliximab may be effective for induction of remission (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>) or reducing the CDEIS (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1999</LINK>). The genetically engineered human antibody to TNF, CDP571, may also be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>) defined entry criteria for disease activity with a CDAI of 150 to 400, and remission simply as a CDAI of less than 150, which is potentially quite easily achievable, since no change in CDAI was required for remission. The other study evaluating CDP571 (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>), found a significant difference over placebo in clinical response rates at week two. Remission data at 2 or 4 weeks were not provided, and the remission rate at 24 weeks was low and did not significantly differ between groups. The single study on etanercept, showed that a dose of 25 mg twice weekly was not effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. The small sample size of this study, however, raises the possibility of a Type II error. </P>
<P>Reported adverse events in the included studies were usually mild to moderate and in most cases, the incidence of reported adverse events in the treatment and placebo groups were similar. It should however be noted that the studies may not have had large enough sample sizes to allow the detection of any increased risk of adverse events in patients receiving TNF-a blocking agents. Recent case series have described an association between TNF-a blocking agents and serious adverse events such as tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Keane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keane 2001</LINK>) and lymphoma (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). These conditions were not described in the patients of the studies included in this review probably because the follow-up period was too short to allow the development of these effects. </P>
<P>We can conclude from this review that infliximab may be effective for induction of remission in acute Crohn's disease. There is also some evidence that CDP571 may be effective. We found no evidence to suggest that etanercept is effective. In addition to its use for induction of remission in Crohn's disease, infliximab and CDP571 may have the potential for use in the maintenance of remission and treatment of Crohn's fistulae. The efficacy of TNF-a blocking agents in these situations should be investigated in separate systematic reviews. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that infliximab and CDP571 may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Infliximab is currently licensed for use in Crohn's disease, but CDP571 is not. The short term adverse effects observed with these agents were, in most cases, not very different from those observed with placebo, but the sample sizes of the primary studies may not have been adequate enough to detect any increased risk in adverse events in patients receiving TNF-a blocking agents. The follow up periods were also too short to allow adequate assessment of long-term adverse events. We found no evidence to support the use of etanercept for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The need clearly exists for more randomised controlled trials. Future randomised controlled trials should have adequate sample sizes to allow the possible detection of any increased risk of adverse events in patients receiving TNF-a blocking agents. These studies should also be designed in such a way that patients are followed up long term after receiving these medications to allow adequate assessment of long term adverse events. Inclusion of remission rates, as well as clinical response rates, as outcome measures at similar time points in the study design would also be informative. Randomised controlled trials are needed in the paediatric population to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of TNF-blocking agents in this special group.</P>
