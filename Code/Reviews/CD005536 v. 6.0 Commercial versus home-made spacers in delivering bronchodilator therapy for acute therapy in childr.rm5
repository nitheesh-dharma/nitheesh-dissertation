To increase readability, suggestions' are: &lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;1.The data collection and analysis can probably be shortened. I HAVE SHORTENED ABSTRACT&lt;br&gt;2.In the main results, add in how many participants were enrolled and how many completed. NOT DONE&lt;br&gt;Background &lt;br&gt;3.Typo in first para, line 8- 'treatmente' CORRECTED&lt;br&gt;Methods of review: &lt;br&gt;4.Although it won't alter the results, it is arguably important to appreciate that young children (&amp;lt;2-3 years) may not be able to utilise a spacer adequately without a mask. With the commercial spacers, a mask that snuggles well with the mouthpiece is available; this is unlikely to be available with home-made spacers. Similarly home-made spacers which utilises a nose and mouth approach (eg with polystyrene cup) as opposed to a mouth only manoeuvre (eg in a plastic bottle). This should be considered in the sensitivity analysis (ie with/without mask) and associated with this age is also an important factor as one study included young children (aged 1+ years with mean of 4.8 years) as this would influence how well the spacers are used. NO CHANGE&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;5.'Pulmonary functions' should probably be pulmonary function tests CHANGED&lt;br&gt;6.Figures: the directions of the 'favours commercial' and 'favours home-made' are inconsistent. It would be easier if all are in the same direction NOT CHANGED&lt;br&gt;7.From the included tables, more than study have 'clinical scores' (01/04) and thus authors should relook at whether they can combine these. For eg Zar 1999 and 2007 also have change in clinical scores and Panicker 2001 has dyspnea score. NO CHANGE&lt;br&gt;8.The peak flow numbers need to be clarified as Panicker 2001 study included children who are very young ie 1 year old and on the figure there was 30 in each group which is the total number in the study. Peak flows can only reliably be done in older children (aged &amp;gt;5 years). This may be a factor in the heterogeneity found. NO CHANGE AS NO DATA IN THE PAPER.........&lt;br&gt;Reviewers conclusion&lt;br&gt;9.Should probably be framed in the positive ie instead of &amp;#8230;.failed to &amp;#8230;could be 'Review did not find any difference&amp;#8230;. ALTERED&lt;br&gt;10.For the research, arguably age and use of mask with spacers should be considered. AGREED AND ADDED&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3.1&lt;br&gt;CJC edit of revised version Dec 14th&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making changes to this review. I think it reads much better now. The non-randomised trial is excluded and sensible reservations are made about the confidence intervals. I have added labels to the metaview plots to indicate the direction of treatment effects.&lt;br&gt;The remaining difficulty is with the doses and the dose response curve. The dose used is appropriate for children with acute wheeze, so in practice this is the sort of dose needed to test the spacers. I do not agree that the dose is likely to be over the top of the dose response curve and have amended the discussion and conclusions accordingly. I have also added a rider about the Zar 2007 study as this used a face mask for smaller children!&lt;br&gt;If the authors are happy with the revisions we could send this out for Peer Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC edit Oct 29th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;The Protocol for this review is as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Objectives: The aim of this review is to determine the efficacy of the commercially produced spacers versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma attacks.&lt;br&gt;Criteria for considering studies for this review&lt;br&gt;Types of studies: All randomised, controlled clinical trials will be included in the analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;ACTION: The objective is to present the evidence not to pre-judge the type of conclusion. I have altered this to the usual cochrane review objective description. I assume you included RCTs that were open or double-blind double dummy design. I have removed non-randomised trials as I do not think it is appropriate to include these in view of the risk of bias without any randomisation. See changes in red. The non-randomised study can be mentioned in the results. this needs changing in the abstract too.&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: The numbers in 1#1have been changed to admissions, as this is the usual way of recording the data. The confidence interval for this paper is quite wide when relative risks are used. The authors quote the 90% CI for RD as 0.059 and translate this limit as an NNT of 17. You could quote these results and leave the reader to assess whether this is tight enough to use homemade spacers (as this will be a trade off in practice). You will however need to point out the use of a face mask for smaller children and priming the bottle spacer before use.&lt;br&gt; 1#5 needs to be SMD as it is on different scales.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I do not agree with your conclusions from this data. &lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: This needs revising in the light of the methods and results below.&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: The main analysis should be on studies that use repeated treatments as this is the approach used in clinical practice. See the review on the Cochrane Library comparing Holding Chambers and Nebulisers in acute asthma where the primary analysis is based on repeated treatments. I would advise that Chong Panicker and Zar 2007 are the appropriate trials to combine? Obgiazge only gives 2 puffs as a single dose! Singhal and Zar 1999 are also single dose studies. I would not regard these are useful to inform clinical practice.&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Need revision. The data presented do not support equivalence in the way you suggest. It is not reasonable to expect that home-made spacers should be completely equivalent to commercial ones, as the drug delivery is going to be different. What matters are the clinical outcomes after titrated treatment regimens. The trials do not show a significant difference but to claim equivalence I would look for a Relative Risk that has a confidence interval entirely between 0.9 and 1.1. The Zar 2007 study does not have this, but they present helpful absolute confidence interval limits which could be put into the review. Note that this only applies to the particular circumstances of that one trial and cannot be generalised. What was the need for additional treatment in Zar 2007? It seems to me that use of oral corticosteroids coudl be used for this outcome from this study.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: See above. What makes you think the doses are rather high? how do you use MDI and spacer for acute asthma in clinical practice?&lt;br&gt;Reviewer Conclusions: need revision in light of the above.&lt;br&gt;Next action: At present this review is not ready for publication or peer review. Please could the authors have a look at my comments and revise the review?&lt;br&gt;PS the abstract is also well over the 400 word limit.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Notes on 21/04/2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 11, 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby J. Lasserson&lt;br&gt;Review Group Co-ordinator&lt;br&gt;Airways Review Group &lt;br&gt;Cochrane Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RE: &amp;quot;Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute asthma in children&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to respond to Brian Rowe comments and submit a revised version of the systematic review. Our point-by-point responses (R) to his comments (C) are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C1: Need update on the sources of support. Surely there is someone (university/hospital) who should be credited!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R1: We agree. We have added text in the Acknowledgments section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C2: Efficacy vs. effectiveness. You need to be careful with these terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R2: Text revised accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C3: Abstract and overall Conclusion: You keep using the term equivalence and that is inappropriate. These samples are small and the 95% CI are wide, so you cannot say they are &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot;. For example, the results for need for additional treatment are important to examine (RR = 1.02 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.41). These results (which I have changed to RR) imply as much as a 27% reduction or a 41% increase in need for additional treatment. With this level of impression, you cannot say these approaches are &amp;quot;the same&amp;quot; (equivalent). Are you falsely reassured by using the RD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R3: Conventional meta-analysis provides pooled estimates of differences between treatments (with uncertainty reflected in the width of the confidence intervals). But to demonstrate an acceptable level of &amp;quot;equivalence&amp;quot; we need to estimate and interpret the probability of an intervention&amp;#180;s efficacy lying within a &amp;quot;non-inferiority&amp;quot; boundary (Wiens BL. Control Clin Trials 2002; 23:2-14). We have to make a judgment about what level of non-inferiority is acceptable, and agree on a tolerable probability of breaching this threshold. The null hypothesis in an equivalence study is that the smallest difference of clinical importance exists in favour of the control intervention. By rejecting this hypothesis in favour of the alternate hypothesis of no difference in outcomes, one can conclude that the interventions are equivalent. When the study is complete, a confidence interval for the difference between treatments is calculated, and if this value lies entirely within the range selected for clinical importance, then equivalence can be claimed (Jones B, Jarvis P, Lewis JA. BMJ 1996; 313: 36-39).&lt;br&gt;So, to claim equivalence, for each outcome we predefined particular limits of clinical important differences between commercial and home-made spacers or ranges of equivalence for the treatment differences, as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We predefined a range of equivalence for the treatment differences in hospital discharge, need for additional treatment, PEFR and HR measures as a two-sided 95% CI from -5 to +5, and a range of equivalence for the treatment differences in SaO2, and clinical score as an interval from -2 to +2.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#180;s the reason why we used risk differences (RD) instead of relative risks (RR) to calculate pooled estimates for binary outcomes. &lt;br&gt;Please find attached two meta-analyses analyzed to demonstrate equivalence between interventions, and using RD as effect measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C4: Introduction: Replace (Anderson 1989) with a newer reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R4: Reference (Anderson 1989) has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C5: Need references: Antibiotics (ref), inhaled mucolytics (ref), aminophylline (ref), sedation (ref) and antihistamines (ref), have no established role in the treatment of exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R5: We have added references about antibiotics, inhaled mucolytics, aminophylline, sedation and antihistamines in the Introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C6: Need references: The high cost and lack of availability of commercial produced spacers have limited their use in developing countries.(ref)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R6: We have added a reference about this statement in the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C7: Methods: Population: When you state: &amp;quot;..the children under 18 years with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma&amp;quot;, did all studies involve the ED or acute care setting where children could be observed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R7: All included studies involved the ED or acute care setting where children could be observed. One study (Obgaidze 2005) included hospitalized patients. We have added text in the Criteria for considering studies for this review section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C8: What did you do with mixed age (adolescents and young adults) studies? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R8: One study (Samaranayake 1998) included mixed population of patients (pediatric and adult subjects), it wasn`t possible to separate data from pediatric patients and we didn&amp;#180;t get response from authors, so we excluded from our analysis data of this study. This information has been included in the table of excluded studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C9: Interventions: role of systemic corticosteroids?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R9: Only one study (Zar 2007) described and/or analyzed the addition of systemic corticosteroids to the treatment of patients. Oral corticosteroids were prescribed for children who required hospitalization or who required 2 or more bronchodilator treatments. This information has been included in the table of included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C10: Searches - why didn't you use the CAG Asthma and wheez* database?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R10: Elizabeth Arnold helped us in identifying relevant trials, but she had never mentioned anything to me about CAG Asthma and wheez* database. Do you know if her search strategy included this database? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C11: Quality: reference Schultz for the Cochrane quality assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R11: Schulz reference have been added in the text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C12: Statistics: We don't usually report RD as the primary effect measure. RR is the most appropriate measure here and should be reported; RD can be reported and used to calculate NNT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R12: Please see R3 above. We agree with the reviewer that RR is the most commonly reported effect measure in conventional meta-analysis. However, this meta-analysis was analyzed to demonstrate an acceptable level of equivalence between both type of spacers, and we consider RD is the most appropriate effect measure. Alternatively, we could report both effect measures (RD and RR). Please find attached two meta-analyses analyzed to demonstrate equivalence between interventions, and using RD as effect measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C13: Description I'd delete this paragraph: &lt;br&gt;The most frequently encountered problem was that many of the included studies were designed and analyzed as if they were superiority trials, not equivalence studies. The aim in these superiority trials was to rule out equality between spacers by rejecting the null hypothesis that there was no difference between the two devices, and such studies usually require fewer patients than those designed to test equivalence. A common mistake, when a superiority trial fails to reject the null hypothesis of no difference, is to conclude that the two interventions being compared are equivalent (Jones 1996). However, although lack of proof of superiority may be consistent with equivalence, it does not prove that equivalence is present. The null hypothesis in an equivalence trial is that the smallest difference of clinical importance exists in favour of the control intervention. By rejecting this hypothesis in favour of the alternate hypothesis of no difference in outcomes, one can conclude that the interventions are equivalent. When the trial is complete, a confidence interval for the difference between treatments is calculated, and if this value lies entirely within the range selected for clinical importance, then equivalence can be claimed (Jones 1996).&lt;br&gt; R13: We think this paragraph is important to highlight the common mistake to conclude that two interventions being compared are equivalent, when a superiority trial fails to reject the null hypothesis of no difference, and to explain correct method to analyze a study when you want to claim equivalence between two interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C14: I'm concerned you are deleting studies because of skewed data. The use of skewed data is permitted and it can medians can replace means and IQRs can be used to impute SDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R14: We are not deleting studies because of skewed data. Some studies reported some outcomes as medians and interquartile ranges because the outcomes distribution was so skewed, and these outcomes couldn&amp;#180;t be pooled. But none of the studies were excluded entirely for this reason. To the best of my knowledge, when sample sizes are reasonably large and the distribution of the outcome is similar to the normal distribution, the width of the interquartile range will be approximately 1.3 standards deviations, but in other situations, when the outcomes distribution is strong skewed, like our meta-analysis, it is not possible to estimate a standard deviation from an interquartile range. In fact the use of interquartile ranges rather than standard deviations can often be taken as an indicator that the outcome distribution is skewed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C15: When you say there was statistical heterogeneity, you need to state the I2 value.&lt;br&gt; R15: We agree. We have added I2 value when we say there was statistical heterogeneity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C16: The section on the decisions regarding equivalence should be in the methods. They need references, and I don't think you'll find them; so I'd be very careful here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R16: The section on the decisions regarding equivalence was returned to methods section, and we have added references in the text. Please see R3 above.&lt;br&gt;C17: You include hospital discharge here, and there is no plot for hospital discharge/admission. Not sure how this can be included in the equivalence if its only reported by 1 study!&lt;br&gt; R17: We agree. We have added a forest plot for hospital discharge. We conclude that interpretation and applicability of our results needs to be cautious, in part, because of absence of the primary outcome of interest (hospital discharge, available from only one study) and other clinically important outcomes in the majority of included studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;C18: Discussion: Until the issues above are resolved, it's premature to comment on the discussion.&lt;br&gt; R18: We agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C19: Meta-views: You don't have all data entered (even if there is only 1 trial, you need to have it in the meta-view).&lt;br&gt; R19: We agree. We have added a forest plot for hospital discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C20: From the looks of the data presented, I'd suggest you have to use SMD rather than WMD. If you look at Figure for PEFR, the estimates for PEFR range from what look like difference scores (Quetulio), to % predicted (Panicker 2001) to absolute values (Objadze 2005). If so, then a WMD here would be inappropriate. Can you re-check?&lt;br&gt; R20: We agree. We have used SMD rather than WMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C21: I'd like RD to be changed to RR&lt;br&gt; R21: Please see R3 and R12 above. We agree with the reviewer that RR is the most commonly reported effect measure in conventional meta-analysis. However, this meta-analysis was analyzed to demonstrate an acceptable level of equivalence between both type of spacers, and we consider RD is the most appropriate effect measure.

I am happy to allow you to delete this.&lt;br&gt;Stats: relative risk (RR) would be more appropriate than OR here.&lt;br&gt;Validity: I would prefer Cochrane and Jadad criteria. There is empirical evidence for their use, but none for the scheme you propose. If you have a reference, then use it. &lt;br&gt;Subgroups: I think you need to put something in about anti-cholinergics and systemic corticosteroids (assuming, like other reviews, there is variation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;br&gt;Cates 2003 (publisher, year, city not in place) and Robinson 2002 (pages show: 150-3 nt J Epidemiol 2002; 31: 150-153) references are incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise looks good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: *Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children&lt;br&gt;Old title: Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-08-21 16:51:28 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="CVH-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<TITLE>Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-17 13:58:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the response to inhaled beta-2 agonists delivered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) attached to home-made spacers, compared with beta-2 agonists delivered through a MDI attached to commercially produced spacers in children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma. Six randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with 658 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review. Overall, this review fails to identify a difference between these two delivery methods for delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma or lower airways obstruction attacks. However, given the small total sample and wide confidence intervals, equivalence between the treatments cannot be claimed.</P>

<P>Overall, this review did not identify a statistically significant difference between these two methods for delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma or lower airways obstruction attacks. Care should be taken in the interpretation and applicability of our results because of the small number of RCTs along with few events available meeting the criteria for inclusion in the review, absence of the primary outcome of interest and other clinically important outcomes in the majority of included studies. The possible need for a face-mask in younger children using home-made spacers should also be considered in practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-13 15:21:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Asthma is a major cause of childhood morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>) and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2000</LINK>), with acute exacerbations of the disease being a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Akinbami-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinbami 2002</LINK>). The main drugs used in the management of acute asthma are rapid-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Ipratropium bromide (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2000</LINK>), inhaled glucocorticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>), and intravenous magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000</LINK>) may also confer benefit in acute asthma. Antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2001</LINK>), inhaled mucolytics (<LINK REF="REF-Sethi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethi 1998</LINK>), aminophylline (<LINK REF="REF-Mitra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 2005</LINK>), sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Sethi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethi 1998</LINK>) and antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Ganse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Ganse 1997</LINK>), have no established role in the treatment of exacerbations. Although rapid-acting inhaled beta 2-agonists are generally administered by nebulization, equivalent (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2005</LINK>) or even greater bronchodilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Rodr_x00ed_guez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodríguez 2004</LINK>), with a more rapid onset, fewer side effects, and less time spent in the ED can be achieved using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer.</P>
<P>Effective use of MDI requires synchronization of inhalation with actuation of the device. Since synchronization is difficult in children, spacer devices are used to overcome this poor co-ordination problem. Spacers have further advantages in that they improve efficacy (increase lung deposition and decrease oropharyngeal deposition) and reduce side effects from inhaled drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Amirav-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amirav 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Singhal 2001</LINK>). For this reason, inhaled therapy using an MDI with attached spacer has been increasingly recognized as the optimal method for delivering rapid acting beta 2-agonists for acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma. A wide variety of commercially produced spacers are available; these differ in shape, size, material out of which they are constructed, and the presence of valves (<LINK REF="STD-Zar-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 2002a</LINK>). The high cost and lack of availability of commercial produced spacers have limited their use in developing countries (<LINK REF="STD-Zar-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>As an alternative, rapid acting beta 2-agonists via MDI have been delivered attached to home-made spacers for treating children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Zar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Singhal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zar-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 2002a</LINK>). A wide variety of home-made spacers have been developed, including plastic cold-drink bottles, plastic mineral water bottles, polystyrene cups, plastic zip-up bags, and paper spacers. In spite of the wide use of these home-made spacers in developing countries, there are only a few studies comparing their use for delivery of rapid acting beta 2-agonists via MDI versus the same bronchodilator therapy with commercially produced spacers for treating acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma in children under 18 years of age.</P>
<P>Although several studies have concluded that rapid acting beta 2-agonists via MDI given attached to home-made spacers produce similar bronchodilation to the same bronchodilator therapy delivered with commercially produced spacers for treating acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma in children (<LINK REF="STD-Panicker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Panicker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Singhal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quetulio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Quetulio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obgaidze-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Obgaidze 2005</LINK>), some of these studies were not powered sufficiently to detect differences between the two devices. We therefore aimed to review the literature to determine if the existing evidence allows concluding that the bronchodilatory response to beta 2-agonists, delivered through metered-dose inhaler (MDI) attached to home-made spacers, is equivalent to the bronchodilatory response to beta 2-agonists delivered through MDI attached to commercially produced spacers, in children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-12-15 11:07:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original version of this review potentially relevant trials relevant trials were identified through searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE (From 1966 to August 2009), EMBASE (From 1974 to August 2009), CINHAL (From 1982 to August 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - Issue 3/2009, and LILACS (From 1982 to August 2009). The full strategies are in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. Controlled trials were identified by using the Cochrane highly sensitive search filter (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>). A search of the Cochrane Airways Group Register was also conducted with the following search strategy:</P>
<P>(spacer* or MDI or bronchodilat* or nebuli* or vapori* or aerosol* or inhal* or "holding chamber" or holding-chamber) and (bottle* or home-made* or "home made" or homemade or alternative* or improvi* or cup or plastic or paper or polystyrene)</P>
<P>For the latest update of this review (2010), the Airways Register has been searched up to August 2010.The Airways Group Register is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.</P>
<P>We included citations in any language. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials identified, contacted the authors of included trials and known experts in the field, and approached pharmaceutical companies that manufacture inhalation spacers to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 13:33:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">I. Trial selection</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (CRM, MPS) scanned the abstracts and titles of articles retrieved by the electronic and handsearches for eligibility, according to the inclusion criteria above. One of the review authors retrieved full copies of all those deemed potentially eligible for closer examination. Two review authors determined whether or not they met eligibility criteria; if necessary we sought advice from other authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">II. Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We developed our data abstraction forms a priori to capture specific items of data needed for this review. We pilot-tested the data extraction form with a sample of three included studies to ensure clarity, completeness and ease of use. We extracted data on study design, details on participants (including age, gender, number in each group), description of the interventions (including process), and description of outcomes, including timing of assessment, and adverse effects. Two review authors (CRM, MPS) independently extracted data from trials to the specially designed form, one review author (CRM) then entered into RevMan, and this was checked by a second using the double data entry facility. If data were not reported in abstractable form, we contacted one of the authors of the included study for additional information. For binary outcome measures we calculated a pooled estimate of the relative risk (RR) of the treatment effect for each outcome. For continuous outcomes, we recorded either mean change from baseline for each group or mean values after intervention, and their respective standard deviations or standard errors, and calculated mean differences. If standard deviations or standard errors were missing, we tried to extract them from other relevant information reported in the paper (P-values, confidence intervals, etc). If the authors could not be contacted or if the information was no longer available, this was reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">III. Trial quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (CRM, MPS) independently assessed the methodological quality using two methods. Firstly, all included trials were scored using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment, using the following principles (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>):<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment</P>
<P>Secondly, the methodological quality of the eligible RCTs was also assessed with a modified version of a 5-point scoring instrument, proposed by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), and summarized as follows:<BR/>1. Was the trial described as randomized (1 = yes; 0 = no)?;<BR/>2. Was the trial described as double-blind (1 = yes; 0 = no)?;<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1 = yes; 0 = no)?;<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1 = yes;0 = no);<BR/>5. Was the method of blinding well described and appropriate (1 = yes; 0 = no)?;<BR/>6. One point was deducted if methods for randomization or blinding were inappropriate.</P>
<P>The modification of the original Jadad scoring instrument consisted of giving one additional point for each of the two items of (1) description and appropriateness of the method of generating the sequence of randomization and (2) description and appropriateness of the method of double blinding, as opposed to the original Jadad scale, which would only award one point even if both items were fulfilled.</P>
<P>Inter-rater reliability was measured by using simple agreement and kappa weighted statistics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">IV. Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) was used to compile and analyze the data. For binary outcomes, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) (for variables measured using the same scale), or the standardised mean differences (SMD) (for variables measured using different scales) and 95% CI. We measured heterogeneity among trials using I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), heterogeneity test Q and by comparing the fixed-effect model (where only within-study variation is considered to influence the uncertainty of the weighted mean results) and random-effects model results (in which both within-study and between-study variations are included in the assessment of the uncertainty of the overall mean results). If statistical heterogeneity was not found, a fixed-effect model was used with 95% confidence interval (CI). If significant heterogeneity was detected, we devoted further research to identify possible causes of heterogeneity for the following characteristics: methodological quality of included studies, severity of asthma attack at presentation, age, presence of valves in commercially produced spacers, material of home-made spacer, and dose of bronchodilator. We explored the impact of these characteristics on heterogeneity and the effectiveness of the intervention by means of subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>In the sensitivity analysis we evaluated the impact of the study quality by separating studies according to low risk of bias (characteristic = "adequate") or medium/high risk of bias (characteristic = "unclear/inadequate") for allocation concealment. We also performed sensitivity analysis with respect to the modified version of the Jadad scale.</P>
<P>We intended to assess publication bias with funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

In this study the proportion of admitted patients was identical in the home-made and commercial spacer groups (15% in each group), so no significant differences were demonstrated between the two spacers in terms of this outcome (RR 1.0, CI 95% 0.63 to 1.59, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-13 15:35:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review constitutes an effort to incorporate the best evidence available up to August 2010 on the role of home-made spacers compared to commercial spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma or lower airway obstruction attacks. Overall, this review fails to identify a difference between these two delivery methods for delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma or lower airways obstruction attacks. When comparing home-made spacers and commercial spacers, no significant differences were demonstrated between the two delivery methods in terms of hospital admission, change in SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, clinical score, change in PEFR, and need for additional treatment. Moreover, sensitivity analysis did not show any significant influences of quality of methods in the efficacy of the commercially produced spacers compared to home-made devices in delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma.</P>
<P>In our meta-analysis we also looked at adverse effects but these were difficult to analyse because there was insufficient information to be pooled. The only one of these measurements that could be pooled was change in HR. When comparing home-made spacers and commercial spacers, no significant differences were demonstrated between groups in terms of this outcome.</P>
<P>These are very relevant findings since acute exacerbations of asthma account for the largest part of direct health costs for asthma in most countries, and the fact that inhaled therapy using a MDI with attached spacer has been increasingly recognized as the optimal method for delivering rapid acting beta 2-agonists for acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma, and that high cost and lack of availability of commercially produced spacers have limited their use in developing countries.</P>
<P>The following outcome measures did not show any heterogeneity when data from different trials were combined: change in SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, change in HR, and need for additional treatment. Statistical heterogeneity was found among trials pooled for change in PEFR (X<SUP>2 </SUP>= 2.99, df = 1, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66.6%, P = 0.08). The statistical heterogeneity for this outcome is difficult to explain due to the limited number of trials reporting this outcome in a way that could be pooled (only two trials). No significant differences were demonstrated between the two spacers in terms of this outcome based on a random effects model (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.80). However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of this statistical heterogeneity among trials, and because there are very few studies, and very few events for this outcome.</P>
<P>Interpretation and applicability of our results needs to be cautious for several reasons: (1) The small number of RCTs along with few events available meeting the criteria for inclusion in the review, (2) absence of the primary outcome of interest (hospital admission, available from only one study) and other clinically important outcomes in the majority of included studies, (3) only limited analysis of outcomes such as change in SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, change in clinical score, and change in PEFR was possible due to data being presented as medians, and (4) the careful preparation and use of delivery devices in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 2007</LINK> used a facemask with the home-made spacer in younger children and took measures to reduce static in both spacers and bottles). Valved commercial spacers contain a one-way, low resistance valve that allows the aerosol to remain within the device until the patient's inhalation effort opens the valve. The theoretical advantages of these valved holding spacers compared to non-valved devices consist in that the former improve coordination with inspiratory flow, and eliminate the cold-Freon effect (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2005</LINK>). Moreover, if the child exhales through non-valved spacers, whether home-made or not, any remaining drug which would have been inhaled on the second inspiration may be lost. However, it's important to take into account that it also has been described advantages of the non-valved spacers over valved holding chambers: the former devices may increase pulmonary aerosol deposition, especially in young children or those with airway obstruction (since overcoming the resistance of the valve on inspiration may be difficult for such patients), and may also minimize the amount of dead space in the spacer (<LINK REF="STD-Zar-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Zar 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>A possible weakness of this review is the inaccessibility of data on outcomes known to have been measured (but unreported), and data not presented in a form that can be combined in the meta-analysis. This may be a confounding factor in the results and thus the conclusions. However, outcomes that could not be entirely pooled owing to skewness of the data and lack of report of mean and standard deviation in some studies (change in SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, change in clinical score, and change in PEFR), were not significantly different between the two spacer devices in these studies.</P>
<P>In summary, this review has demonstrated that all of the analyzed outcomes were not significantly different when home-made spacers were compared with commercial devices in delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma. However, further studies are needed in order to support or to refute the use of home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy to these children. These additional studies should include assessment of clinically important outcomes such as rate of hospitalization or rate of ICU admission, and should be designed and adequately powered to test equivalence (null hypothesis that one device is superior to the other), and also should be designed to compare the two spacers, using lower doses of bronchodilators. Additionally, cost-effectiveness analysis and patient preferences are important considerations that require still further assessment, and must be considered in these additional studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Overall, this review did not identify a difference between these two delivery methods for delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute asthma or lower airways obstruction attacks. However, because of the small number of RCTs along with few events available meeting the criteria for inclusion in the review, absence of the primary outcome of interest and other clinically important outcomes in the majority of included studies, we consider that the results of this review should be interpreted with caution and need confirmation through further, larger trials. In the meanwhile, selection of the spacer device for an individual patient should begin with a commercial spacer with home-made spacers being used if commercial device is not available. The possible need for a face-mask in younger children using home-made spacers should be considered. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies are needed before we can confidently draw conclusions about the efficacy of home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy to children with acute exacerbations of wheezing or asthma. These additional studies should include assessment of clinically important outcomes such as rate of hospitalization or rate of ICU admission, and should be designed and adequately powered to test equivalence (null hypothesis that one device is superior to the other), in order to evaluate whether the theoretical advantages of commercial spacers over non-valved devices (including home-made devices) are so important as to influence the bronchodilator response in evaluating clinically important outcomes. The use of a mask with home-made spacers in small children also needs further clarification. Additionally, cost-effectiveness and patient preferences are important considerations that require further assessment, and should be considered in these additional studies. </P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Beta-agonist: fenoterol hydrobromide. Home-made spacers: sealed 500 ml plastic cold-drink bottle, unsealed 500 ml plastic cold-drink bottle, and 200 ml polystyrene cup. Dosage: 4 puffs (400 µg) for children who weighed 25 kg or less, and 6 puffs (600 µg) for children who weighed more than 25 kg, given at a rate of 1 puff every 10 seconds. Co-interventions: fenoterol 1000 µg in 2 ml normal saline via a jet nebuliser, and oxygen at a flow rate of 5 L per min in children who after bronchodilator treatment had PEFR &lt; 70% of the predicted value. <BR/>Beta-agonist: fenoterol hydrobromide. Commercial spacer: Aerochamber 145 ml. Dosage: 4 puffs (400 µg) for children who weighed 25 kg or less, and 6 puffs (600 µg) for children who weighed more than 25 kg, given at a rate of 1 puff every 10 seconds. <BR/>Co-interventions: fenoterol 1000 µg in 2 ml normal saline via a jet nebuliser, and oxygen at a flow rate of 5 L per min in children who after bronchodilator treatment had PEFR &lt; 70% of the predicted value.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Design: Parallel group study. Randomisation: computer-generated. Blinding: single blind. Excluded: described. Withdrawals: none. Baseline characteristics: comparable. Power calculation: 198 children were required in each group to demonstrate that hospitalisation with bottle spacer was not more than 10% higher, 80% power and a one-tailed significance level of 0.05. Modified Jadad score: 3</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Setting: South Africa. Red Cross Children´s Hospital. 400 children (200 in each group) aged 2 months to 5 years. Inclusion criteria: children with history of cough or difficulty breathing within the prior 5 days and clinical signs of acute lower airways obstruction (expiratory wheeze on auscultation or hyperinflation of the chest). Exclusion criteria: use of bronchodilator within the preceding 4 hours, known underlying cardiac or chronic pulmonary disease (other than asthma), presence of stridor or daily treatment with oral corticosteroids for more than 2 days prior.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Beta-agonist: salbutamol (albuterol). Home-made spacer: modified 500 ml plastic bottle. Dosage: 5 puffs (500 µg) given at a rate of 1 puff every 10 seconds, and given until three times at 15 minute intervals. Co-interventions: oral corticosteroids were prescribed for children who required hospitalisation or who required 2 or more bronchodilator treatments. If additional treatments were required after third inhalation, patients were nebulised (5 mg salbutamol in 2.5 mls normal saline) using a jet nebuliser. Anti-cholinergic agents were not used. <BR/>Beta-agonist: salbutamol (albuterol). Commercial spacer: Aerochamber 150 ml. Dosage: 5 puffs (500 µg) given at a rate of 1 puff every 10 seconds, and given until three times at 15 minute intervals. Co-interventions: oral corticosteroids were prescribed for children with recurrent wheeze who required hospitalisation or who required 2 or more bronchodilator treatments. If additional treatments were required after third inhalation, patients were nebulised (5 mg salbutamol in 2.5 ml normal saline) using a jet nebuliser. Anti-cholinergic agents were not used.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome: hospitalization. Secondary outcomes: change in clinical score, oximetry, number of bronchodilator treatments required prior to discharge (if not hospitalised), and need for systemic corticosteroids.</P>
