<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation). Bronchodilators (reliever inhalers to open up the lungs and airways) can be used for the spasms, and corticosteroids for the swelling. However, many people who are discharged from the emergency department following treatment for an asthma attacks have a relapse within 10 days. The review of six trials involving 374 people found that a short course of corticosteroids after discharge reduces the chances of a relapse, and lessens the need for using reliever inhalers without major adverse effects. The benefit lasts for about three weeks.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department (ED) visits annually. Between 12 to 16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to locate unpublished studies. The most recent search was run in October 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing two types of corticosteroids (oral, intra-muscular, or inhaled) with placebo for outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations in adults or children. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials involving 374 people were included. One study used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. The review was split into two reviews and although the latest search yielded no additional placebo controlled trials an additional IM study was included.<BR/>
<BR/>Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (Relative risk (RR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 0.74). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.89) and there were fewer subsequent hospitalizations (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (mean difference (MD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI -0.47 to 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.44) in the first 7 to 10 days, while rarely reported, showed no significant differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. From these results, as few as ten patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an asthma exacerbation significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care, hospitalizations and use of short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular and oral corticosteroids are both effective.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:15:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Asthma is a common emergency department (ED) presentation in many parts of the world. In both the pediatric and adult populations, asthma is responsible for approximately 10 to 15/1000 ED visits (<LINK REF="REF-Bates-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1990</LINK>). Approximately 10 to 20% of patients presenting to the ED will require admission to the hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2002</LINK>). Moreover, of patients discharged from North American EDs after initial treatment, between 12 to 16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emerman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerman 1999</LINK>). Finally, acute care for exacerbations may be received in an ED, clinic, or office setting. The distinguishing feature of the acute presentation is that patients require assessment and additional therapeutic interventions due to an exacerbation of their airways disease.</P>
<P>The outcomes of these assessments depend on the treatments which are prescribed in the acute care setting and upon discharge. Research indicates that many asthmatics maintain a poor quality of life (QoL) for weeks following exacerbations and are particularly prone to repeat exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>). Clearly, the acute exacerbation of asthma is an important clinical and patient problem.</P>
<P>The approach to asthmatic exacerbations is based on pathophysiologic considerations including treatment of acute bronchospasm and airway oedema. Treatment guidelines exist in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAEP_x002f_CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAEP/CTS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>); however, treatment approaches vary widely. This may be due in part to the rapidly changing management of the disease and the inability of guidelines to influence front-line health care workers (<LINK REF="REF-Cabana-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabana 1999</LINK>). Most importantly, there remains significant debate about the use, dosage, route and length of corticosteroid (or glucocorticoid) treatment of the asthmatic in the in- and out-patient setting. This study is a systematic overview of all randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid treatment following diagnosis, treatment and discharge from the acute care setting. Our aim was to determine if there is clear evidence that treatment of asthmatic exacerbations with corticosteroids is beneficial.</P>
<P>Prior to the original review, only two previous overviews have been published dealing with corticosteroid treatment in asthmatic exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>); however, both these studies contained methodological weaknesses that mandate a re-examination of the literature and a more focused systematic review of this intervention. Since that time, a variety of other narrative and systematic reviews on this topic have been published.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effect of any form of corticosteroids (intramuscular (IM), oral, inhaled) on relapse rate, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), quality of life (QoL), etc., for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (that is, usually the ED) following the assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies including patients presenting to an ED or other acute care setting were considered for inclusion in the overview. Studies recruiting pediatric or adult participants or both were reviewed, and this designation formed one of the proposed subgroup analyses.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Patients randomized to receive either corticosteroids (oral, IM, or inhaled) or placebo following discharge from the acute care setting. Studies comparing two types of corticosteroids were also included. Finally, those patients who were randomized to receive an intramuscular corticosteroid injection prior to discharge or IM plus oral steroids were included. Obviously, asthmatic patients received additional regimens, such as beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, anti-cholinergics, theophylline compounds, anti-histamines, etc. Data for these co-interventions were recorded from studies or requested from authors.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:18:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, two review authors (BR, CS) independently reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. From the full text, using specific criteria, two review authors (CS, FD) independently selected trials for inclusion in this review . Agreement was measured using simple agreement and kappa statistics. Disagreement was resolved by consensus or third party adjudication (BHR).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:18:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>One of the review authors (BR) extracted data for the trials and entered this into the Cochrane Collaboration software program (Review Manager). We contacted primary study authors to verify the data and provide additional clarification and information for the review. Unfortunately, most authors could not access their original data source to perform supplemental analyses without some additional resource allocation. In these cases, expansions of graphic reproductions and estimations were used. Data were checked for reliability with the primary author, or by a second extractor (JB).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:18:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors (BR, CS) independently assessed the quality of included trials using two methods. First, using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment, trials were scored and entered using the following principles:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Unclear concealment<BR/>Grade C: Obviously not adequate concealment .<BR/>Inter-rater reliability was measured by using simple agreement, kappa, and weighted kappa statistics. Disagreement was resolved by a third party adjudication (JB).</P>
<P>Second, each study was assessed for validity using a 0 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and summarized as follows:<BR/>1) Was the study described as randomized (1 = yes;0 = no)?;<BR/>2) Was the study described as double-blind (1 = yes;0 = no)?;<BR/>3) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1 = yes;0 = no)?;<BR/>4) Was the method of randomization well described and appropriate (1 = yes;0 = no);?;<BR/>5) Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate (1 = yes;0 = no)?;<BR/>6) Deduct 1 point if methods for randomization or blinding were inappropriate. Inter-rater reliability was measured by using simple agreement, kappa, and weighted kappa statistics.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:18:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We combined all trials using Review Manager. Subgroup comparisons are identified in the Comparisons section. For dichotomous variables, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); a fixed-effect model was used. For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trials results as mean and pooled using mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% CIs using a random-effects model.</P>

<P>Generally, the evidence for intervention with corticosteroids in asthma originates in older literature; however, for this review most studies were produced in the past 15 years. Since the previous overviews (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>) two additional studies have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNamara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 1993</LINK>), and one additional study has been identified (<LINK REF="STD-Deshpande-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Deshpande 1986</LINK>). Five of the seven studies were conducted in North America. Following a split in the review in 2007, the Hoffman paper (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 1988</LINK>) was removed and we inserted in a new study comparing IM versus oral corticosteroid.</P>
<P>It is important to note that all participants included in these studies were released or "discharged" from the acute care setting, and were not admitted to hospital. The severity of the asthmatic exacerbation could not easily be determined from these studies. In general, significant reductions in the mean pulmonary functions at presentation were demonstrated. Participants generally required less than 80% predicted PEFR or FEV-1 to be eligible for inclusion in the trials. Mean pretreatment PEFRs were reported as: 158 to 169 L/min (<LINK REF="STD-Fiel-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fiel 1983</LINK>), 193 to 198 (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 1993</LINK>), and 200 to 210 L/min (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1993a</LINK>). Chapman reported a mean pretreatment FEV-1 of 46% predicted.</P>
<P>Different co-interventions were provided in each study, including theophylline, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, and anticholinergics; however, none of the studies specifically provided inhaled steroid agents to their patients at discharge; use of inhaled steroids prior to the exacerbation was variable (range: 0 to 20%). The use of theophyllines has declined over the span of the studies, and these observations will be discussed in the Implications section. The duration of the oral steroid intervention also varied from 3 to 10 days.</P>
<P>A variety of outcome measures were reported with "relapse to additional care" being the most common. The definition of a relapse varied slightly, but generally included an unscheduled presentation to receive additional assessment and treatment. Scores from a variety of symptom scales were occasionally used to describe outcomes. Due to the different scores used, no consistent outcome analysis was possible. In addition, a number of pulmonary function results were employed (including PEFR, FEV-1, FVC, % predicted PEFR, % predicted FEV-1); however, consistent reporting was not found and this again limited the possible analyses. Finally, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and side-effects were occasionally reported.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:25:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Overall, the methodological quality was rated as high. Many of the studies were double-blind, placebo controlled, demonstrated an appreciation of the need for concealment of allocation, and reported a sufficient number of outcomes (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using the Jadad method, five studies were rated as "strong" (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deshpande-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Deshpande 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiel-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fiel 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1983</LINK>), and one was rated as "weak" (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 1993</LINK>). Using the Cochrane methodology, three were rated as having blinded allocation, three were rated as having unclear allocation blinding, and one was rated as having non-blinded allocation.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Results from this meta-analysis are reported by outcome rather than time of follow-up assessment. The main results are reported as overall effects of oral and IM versus placebo; however, more studies used oral than IM steroids as an intervention.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Relapse to Additional Care</HEADING>
<P>Significantly fewer participants relapsed to require additional care at 7 to 10 days (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) after an exacerbation when corticosteroids were used. In addition, fewer hospitalizations occurred in those participants receiving systemic corticosteroids (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95). No significant heterogeneity was found in these results (both I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Relapse data were only reported in one study at 21 days, and steroids demonstrated a persistent benefit (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.89).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oral versus IM Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>The combined results for all corticosteroid treatment options (oral/IM) failed to identify heterogeneity. Oral corticosteroids provided a similar reduction in relapses when compared to placebo (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.94). While IM corticosteroids appeared efficacious, due to small numbers the confidence intervals were wide (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.09). Overall, no significant difference between IM corticosteroids and oral agents was found when assessment was made within the first 7 to 10 days.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist Use</HEADING>
<P>Patients receiving any form of corticosteroids reported less need for beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists at 7 to 10 days of follow-up (MD -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). This finding was provided in only two studies and no significant heterogeneity was identified in this result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Side Effects</HEADING>
<P>Total side effects were reported as being "rare" in most studies, but only two trials gave sufficient information to be included in this analysis. The pooled estimate revealed similar rates of side effects in both groups (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.74); however, significant heterogeneity was identified (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75.5%). An insufficient number of studies were available to provide meaningful sensitivity or sub-group comparisons, or firm conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pulmonary Function Testing</HEADING>
<P>Pulmonary functions were rarely reported; two studies reported results at seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1993b</LINK>). No significant differences between the treatment groups were demonstrated at two to three days (SMD 0.48; 95% CI -1.2 to 2.2) or 7 to 10 days (SMD 0.09; 95% CI -0.46 to 0.63) of follow up. Insufficient studies reported pulmonary functions and provided meaningful sub-group comparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>A variety of symptom scores were reported. It appeared that symptoms improved in those studies that reported this information. For example, no study reported worsening symptoms in the steroid group. Cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing were all significantly reduced in the corticosteroid treatment group; however due to poor reporting and lack of standardization, no meaningful comparisons could be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT)</HEADING>
<P>Given these results, applying the RR to a placebo group baseline relapse risk of 17%, and using Visual Rx (www.nntonline.net) only ten patients (95% CI 8 to 23) would require treatment with corticosteroids to prevent one relapse to additional care in the first 7 to 10 days after outpatient care for an exacerbation,<I> see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. Using similar methods only 11 patients (95% CI 9 to 143) would require treatment with corticosteroids to prevent one relapse to hospitalization after outpatient care for an exacerbation <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity/Subgroup Analyses</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses on the results based on quality scores eliminated one paper (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 1993</LINK>); following this, the 7 to 10 day relapse results were unchanged (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.96). Further subgroup analyses (<I>see </I>&#8242;Methods&#8242;) could not be performed due to small study numbers or missing data.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 11:21:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This meta-analysis summarises all of the current evidence regarding the treatment of patients with asthma exacerbations using systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo. Using comprehensive search strategies and methods to avoid selection bias, this review highlights the importance of providing corticosteroid treatment to patients treated as outpatients following an asthma exacerbation. The results indicate that all patients requiring assessment for an exacerbation appear to warrant consideration for this form of therapy. Most studies restricted enrolment to patients with pulmonary functions of less than 80% predicted, suggesting at least a moderate exacerbation. Corticosteroid therapy not only reduced relapses to additional care, it also reduced subsequent admissions to hospital and use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Conversely, there appeared to be no significant difference with respect to pulmonary functions and side effects between treating with corticosteroids and placebo. Both of these conclusions, however, are based on data from a limited number of studies, thus these conclusions should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
<P>The difference between treating with corticosteroids compared to placebo is pronounced by 7 to 10 days follow up; as few as nine patients require treatment to prevent one relapse to additional care. In addition, the choice of therapy does not appear to affect these conclusions. Providing either oral or intramuscular agents appears to be equally beneficial; patient preference, compliance considerations and costs should all be weighed in the treatment decision. Caution is advised when interpreting the results of the different routes due to the indirect comparisons included in this review and the limited data available. Another Cochrane review will formally summarize the IM versus oral corticosteroid data in more detail.</P>
<P>These recommendations are in keeping with those provided by the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP; <LINK REF="REF-CAEP_x002f_CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAEP/CTS 1999</LINK>), National Asthma Education Prevention Plan (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>) and the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). All recommend systemic corticosteroids for patients with an exacerbation of asthma.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Methodological limitations</HEADING>
<P>Due to the small number of trials included in this meta-analysis and the overall small number of patients upon which these results are based, no firm conclusions regarding subgroups by severity or age can be made. The overall findings seem to apply to all patients. In addition, the small samples preclude an accurate assessment of side effects associated with the corticosteroid treatment.</P>
<P>There is a possibility of publication bias or study selection bias in this meta-analysis. For example, by missing unpublished negative trials we may be over estimating the effect of corticosteroid treatment. However, a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant studies was conducted, using a systematic strategy to avoid bias. This was followed by attempts to contact corresponding and first authors. No unpublished or negative trials were uncovered; however, we recognize they may exist. The review has been updated with additional searches and no new data pertaining to this research question have emerged.</P>
<P>Several other methodological issues limit the applicability of the results of this review. First, most studies were conducted in an emergency setting, and patient presentations may be less severe in ambulatory care, office or clinic settings than those studied. Consequently, these results need confirmation in the community setting. Second, baseline severity was variable and poorly documented. Thus, subgroup comparisons were not possible on the severity of the exacerbation presentation. We agree with others (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 1991</LINK>), however, who suggest patients included in these studies often had less severe exacerbations than patients with exacerbations who were not enrolled.</P>
<P>The definition of relapse, while variable, appears an effective measure of asthma outcome. Better standardization of this outcome would however improve study comparability. Evaluation of pulmonary function data was complicated by a lack of standardised reporting and changing analyses within the reports. For example, PFT analyses often changed from comparisons of treatment vs control at the start of the study, to comparisons between relapse and non-relapse groups in the publication. This precluded more formal evaluation of the effects of the interventions based on PFTs and also the effects of the intervention on PFTs at follow-up.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review of randomized controlled trials confirms evidence from earlier meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>) and strongly supports the use of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids for treatment of outpatients released from the acute care setting with an exacerbation of asthma. Several recommendations can be made.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Patients who present for assessment and treatment with an exacerbation of asthma are likely to benefit from either oral or intramuscular corticosteroid treatment at release to prevent relapse to additional care and reduce beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use.</LI>
<LI>In this review, oral steroids were provided for a 7 to 10 day period, usually as a tapering dose. Small sample sizes prevented an examination of the relative effectiveness of various regimens and no definitive recommendation concerning dose or dosing protocol emerged from this review. </LI>
<LI>Insufficient data are available to determine the relative advantage of the route of corticosteroid delivery (IM or PO) on outcomes. The place of IM treatment in asthma therapy may be best reserved for those patients with questionable compliance, inability to afford the price of oral prescription medications, or those who are otherwise unreliable (cognitive impairment, intoxication, etc);</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Despite the strength of the findings from this review, several questions regarding treatment of asthmatic exacerbations with corticosteroids remain unanswered. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A systematic review of studies examining the benefit of adding inhaled corticosteroids to the out-patient management of patients with an asthma exacerbation has been completed, which suggests that inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial when added to systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>). Inhaled corticosteroids and combined agents including long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are increasingly employed; the role of systemic corticosteroids in addition to these agents would be an important area for future research.</LI>
<LI>Patients with mild exacerbations may not require oral corticosteroids, and potentially may be released from the acute care setting on inhaled steroids and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist therapy; however, the definition of what constitutes a "mild" exacerbation is unclear at this time. </LI>
<LI>Further detailed evaluation of predictors of relapse under the current recommendations is required. For example, many studies are unclear as to the predictors of relapse, since they did not include corticosteroid use as criteria for release following assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2002</LINK>). The severity of asthma at presentation, and other potential confounders (such as co-interventions), may impact calculations of the number needed to treat (i.e., less severe: may increase number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB); more severe: may decrease NNTB).</LI>
<LI>Future research on asthmatic exacerbations must concentrate on well defined outcomes which may lead to more informative overviews in the future. More specifically, complete reporting of PFT data in a systematic fashion would assist in further work. Finally, better description of the methodology would be also be beneficial.</LI>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcome was relapse; however, it was not specifically defined. Participants (with assistance from their parents if necessary) were asked to record the PEFR in the morning and evening before treatment with bronchodilators, until the follow-up on day 4. Participants were allowed to continue any other previously prescribed treatment, and were asked to document the frequency. Symptom scores were calculated at presentation as well as day 4.</P>
