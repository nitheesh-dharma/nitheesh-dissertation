<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-29 22:18:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Ureteral stones (kidney stones that move down the ureter) frequently lead to renal colic, causing pain, and if left untreated, can block the urinary tract (obstructive uropathy). Both ureteroscopy (an examination by a doctor to see inside the urinary tract) and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL, a procedure that uses high-energy shockwave to break up stones into small particles that are passed out of the body in urine) achieve high success rates in managing ureteric stone disease. We analysed reports from seven randomised controlled trials of 1205 patients and found that ureteroscopy provided a better stone-free rate after treatment, but patients had to stay in hospital longer, and there was a higher risk of complications. We found that there were many variations among the seven studies in their design, duration, and data collected which made comparison and evaluation challenging. We recommend that further evaluation and research is conducted to ensure that new and improved treatments and studies are considered to inform clinical practice.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-28 08:36:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Ureteral stones frequently cause renal colic, and if left untreated, can lead to obstructive uropathy. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy, with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common interventions used to treat ureteral stones. ESWL treatment is less invasive than ureteroscopy, but has some limitations such as a high retreatment rate, and is not available in all centres. Recent advances in ureteroscopy have increased success rates and reduced complication rates.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-17 09:11:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>To examine evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the outcomes of ESWL or ureteroscopy in the treatment of ureteric calculi.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-08-18 16:45:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings, all without language restriction.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-08-22 14:30:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>RCTs that compared ESWL with ureteroscopic retrieval of ureteric stones were included in this review. Study participants were adults with ureteric stones requiring intervention. Published and unpublished sources were considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-08-18 16:45:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Three authors independently assessed study quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-05 10:54:08 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Seven RCTs (1205 patients) were included in the review. Stone-free rates were lower in patients who underwent ESWL (7 studies, 1205 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96) but re-treatment rates were lower in ureteroscopy patients (6 studies, 1049 participants: RR 6.18, 95% CI 3.68 to 10.38. ESWL-treated patients had less need for auxiliary treatment (5 studies, 751 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74; fewer complications (7 studies, 1205 participants: RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.88); and shorter length of hospital stay (2 studies, 198 participants: MD -2.55 days, 95% CI -3.24 to -1.86).</P>
<P>Three studies adequately described the randomisation sequence, three studies were unclear on how they randomised, while one study had a high risk of selection bias. All the studies had an unclear risk of performance bias and detection bias, while all had a low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias, or other sources of bias identified.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-01 15:11:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-22 14:30:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Nephrolithiasis is a common disease with a peak incidence around the third to fourth decade of life (<LINK REF="STD-Ramello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramello 2000</LINK>). The lifetime risk of urolithiasis in the general population is 13% in men and 7% in women (<LINK REF="STD-Argyropoulos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Argyropoulos 2010</LINK>), and prevalence is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Pearle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearle 2005</LINK>). Known risk factors that can contribute to the development of ureteric stones include socioeconomic status, environmental factors, genetic predisposition and certain metabolic disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Coe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coe 1992</LINK>). History of previous ureteric stone disease increases the probability of a second stone forming within five to seven years to approximately 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Stamatelou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamatelou 2003</LINK>). The most common symptom of ureteric stones is pain, often in the form of colic, which is caused by irritation of submucosal nerve fibres triggered by movement of stones which results in spasm, dilatation, peristalsis and obstruction. Ureteric stones are usually formed in the renal collecting system and progress downward into the ureter. Stones tend to lodge at three narrowings in the ureter: the pelvi-ureteric junction, over the iliac vessels, and at the ureteric meatus. The accepted management of ureteric stones ranges from observation (watchful waiting with or without expulsive treatment using different drugs) to surgical exposure of ureter and stone removal (ureterolithotomy). Various factors such as stone size, symptom severity, degree of obstruction, kidney function, stone location and urinary tract infection status influence the choice of intervention. Although recent reports address the beneficial effects of medical management, especially use of alpha adrenergic blockers in enhancing clearance of stones in the distal ureters (<LINK REF="REF-Dellabella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellabella 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupeli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupeli 2004</LINK>), this review is limited to ureteroscopic and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) management of ureteric stones.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-01 15:11:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The emergence of increasingly effective and minimally invasive techniques such as ESWL and ureteroscopy have contributed to the gradual disappearance of open surgical procedures to treat ureteric stones. The choice of ESWL or ureteroscopy for ureteric stone management is one of the most commonly debated controversies in endourology, which may be partly attributable to parallel technology advancement in both fields. Success rates following ureteroscopic management using different ureteroscopes and intracorporeal devices have been reported at between 86% and 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>). Miniaturisation of instruments has decreased rates of serious complications such as ureteric perforation and stricture formation. Uteroscopic procedures for ureteric stone management report occurrence rates of between 2% and 4% for ureteric perforation and 0% to 2% for stricture (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>). Success rates for ESWL have been reported in the range of 80% to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-el_x002d_Faqih-1988" TYPE="STUDY">el-Faqih 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>). Some attractive attributes of ESWL treatment are its non-invasive nature, higher levels of patient acceptance, lack of need for general anaesthetic, and provision of treatment in outpatient facilities. These are countered by proponents of ureteroscopy who cite immediacy of stone-free status, wider availability of equipment and lower cost, especially for lower ureteric stones, as advantageous aspects.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-22 14:30:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The European Association of Urology/American Urological Association (EAU/AUA) <I>2007 Guideline for the Management of Ureteral Calculi</I> indicates that both ESWL and ureteroscopy are considered to be reasonable options for all stones that require intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Preminger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preminger 2007</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Preminger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preminger 2007</LINK> report accepts that the nature of the evidence available from a review of the literature was poor quality and recommended further research. Most included studies were retrospective and had wide variations in reported incidence of outcome, and significant variability in reported treatment data. The recommendations of the EAU/AUA panel were based on the large number of retrospective, and few prospective, clinical series available. <LINK REF="REF-Preminger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preminger 2007</LINK> commented that little evidence could be derived about the benefits and harms of various treatments of ureteric stones if non-randomised clinical case series were excluded from the review. Two randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verze-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Verze 2010</LINK>) reported since the publication of the <I>2007 Guideline</I> prompted our decision to conduct a systematic review to address the question of whether superiority could be established between ESWL and ureteroscopy.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-18 16:51:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>It remains uncertain if one mode of treatment is better than the other and which stones are best suited to a particular treatment. The considerable variability in the use of ESWL and ureteroscopy, even within a single healthcare system such as the National Health Service (UK), reflects this uncertainty. It is therefore important to determine if either treatment has important clinical benefits in the management of ureteric stones.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stone-free rate</HEADING>
<P>All included studies reported stone-free rates achieved, but time points for measurement differed. Stone-free status was measured at three months (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verze-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Verze 2010</LINK>); 43 days (<LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>); 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK>); and 2 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>). The measurement time point was unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Achievement of stone-free status favoured ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (7 studies, 1205 participants): RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; P = 0.11; I² = 87%). There was marked heterogeneity in lithotriptor devices used and their power settings among ESWL-treated patients. Both the stone-free rates and lithotriptor devices used varied in studies of ESWL-treated patients. No significant difference in stone-free rates was reported for both interventions at three months in a study that used an unmodified HM3 lithotriptor (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>). However, this study was closed prematurely because no significant differences were found in stone-free rates at the interim analysis point. The sizes of ureteroscopes, protocols for retaining ureteric stents, and sources of intracorporeal lithotripsy used in the reported studies also varied.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Retreatment rate</HEADING>
<P>Retreatment was defined as a subsequent intervention for the condition using the same therapeutic technique as the initial treatment. Data from one study were excluded from the meta-analysis because re-treatment was reported as ratios rather than rates (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>). ESWL-treated patients had higher re-treatment rates compared with ureteroscopically-treated patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> (6 studies, 1049 participants): RR 6.18, 95% CI 3.68 to 10.38; P &lt; 0.00001; I² = 0%). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>) reported that re-treatment was not provided for patients in the HM3 lithotriptor subgroup. The authors attributed this outcome to the higher power and larger focal zone provided by this device, compared with other lithotriptors. The re-treatment ratio reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>) was higher in ESWL-treated patients (1.5 versus 1.1) for whom a mobile Dornier HM4 lithotriptor was used.</P>

Results from a meta-analysis of five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verze-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Verze 2010</LINK>). indicated that ureteroscopically-treated patients needed more auxiliary procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> (5 studies, 751 participants): RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74; P = 0.003; I² = 74%) than those who underwent ESWL. Although most patients required stents following ureteroscopy, this was conducted routinely in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>), and selectively in others (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verze-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Verze 2010</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis conducted following removal of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>) from the meta-analyses attained homogeneity (I² = 0%), with no effect on overall significance (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> (4 studies, 671 participants): RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>The definition of auxiliary procedures in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>) included flushing of ureters, Dormia basket extraction and administration of frusemide. According to American Urological Association guidelines, these would be considered as routine procedures for ureteroscopy.

The complication rate was higher among patients who underwent ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> (7 studies, 1205 participants): RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.88; P = 0.01; I² = 49%) but many of these were either minor (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verze-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Verze 2010</LINK>) or unrelated to the procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>) reported a higher rate of minor complications (no intervention required) in patients who underwent electrohydraulic intracorporeal lithotripsy fragmentation of stones during ureteroscopy.</P>
<P>Major complications, including ureteral strictures, were reported for both interventions in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK>). However, because this study included patients with kidney failure and ureteric obstruction, strictures could not be ascribed to procedure-related causes or to long-standing obstruction caused by ureteric stones. This study also reported that patients experienced higher levels of pain during ESWL treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rates of urinary tract infections were reported to be higher in patients who underwent ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Postprocedural symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Postprocedural symptoms outcomes were not reported widely. Flank pain, dysuria and haematuria were reported on a scale from 0 to 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>), and a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 was used to report pain (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>). A slightly higher rate of symptoms were reported among patients who underwent ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> (2 studies, 106 participants): MD -1.64, 95% CI -3.94 to 0.67; P = 0.16). This was unexpected because most ureteroscopy patients (91%) had postprocedural stenting. Higher pain scores were reported from patients undergoing ureteroscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>). The need for analgesia was addressed in one study that reported a higher requirement for pain relief in ESWL-treated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> (1 study, 64 participants): RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.94). The significant heterogeneity found was due to the way the two studies measured these symptoms. The different scales used in <LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK> led to a large discrepancy between the two results resulting in the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The numbers of patients who presented to emergency departments, or needed to be readmitted, or both, was reported and showed that ESWL patients were significantly more likely to present for pain, bleeding or infection (<LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> (1 study, 200 participants): RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.84).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy quotient (EQ)</HEADING>
<P>Efficiency quotients (EQ) for ureteroscopy and ESWL were calculated and compared but results varied: one study favoured ESWL (0.50 for ESWL and 0.38 for ureteroscopy; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>); another favoured ureteroscopy (0.79 for ureteroscopy and 0.43 for ESWL in stones more than 1 cm diameter; 0.88 for ureteroscopy and 0.7 for ESWL in stones less than 1 cm diameter; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>), and a third determined no difference (0.61 for ESWL and 0.63 for ureteroscopy; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>). The EQ takes into account the stone-free rate, the need for re-treatment and auxiliary procedures. The study favouring ESWL applied a broad definition of auxiliary procedures to include flushing of ureters and use of Dormia basket. If these procedures are considered to be routine for ureteroscopic extraction of stones, the EQ for ureteroscopy becomes 0.66 (favouring ureteroscopy).</P>

<P>Ureteroscopic fragmentation and retrieval of stones was found to have a higher stone-free rate, but a greater likelihood of complications, and longer hospital stays.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 15:20:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The observation that stone-free rates were higher with ureteroscopy was unsurprising, given the advantages of direct visualisation, combined with retrieval of stones using baskets and forceps or after intracorporeal lithotripsy fragmentation that can be achieved for most patients within a single setting. Although further large well designed studies are required to address these issues, there is limited evidence to suggest that introduction of holmium:YAG lasers and advent of small calibre ureteroscopes has enhanced ureteroscopy success rates and lowered complication rates (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>). Although stone size has been reported to influence outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>), no statistically significant difference was found in stone size with either ESWL or ureteroscopy among studies included in this review (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Three studies reported efficiency quotients (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>) favouring ureteroscopy in one (efficiency quotient redefined taking out the routine procedural components as a part of ureteroscopy) (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>). In this study stenting was extended for lower ureteric stones (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>). There is an increasing trend to avoid stents in clinical practice as stents have been shown to cause distressful lower urinary tract symptoms and impair quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Joshi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the studies used validated questionnaires to assess lower urinary symptoms following stenting or patient satisfaction and this area needs further research. Surprisingly, one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>) reported higher patient satisfaction in the ureteroscopy group despite that most patients were stented following the procedure. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK> reported no significant differences in patients' satisfaction for either intervention derived from a self-administered questionnaire.</P>
<P>With one exception (<LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK>), there were no reports of ureteric stricture following either intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2002</LINK> included patients with kidney failure caused by obstructing stones and reported no differences in stricture rates between ESWL and ureteroscopy at the four week follow-up.</P>
<P>Success rates for ESWL treatment have been reported to be machine-dependant in clinical practice (<LINK REF="STD-Graber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Graber 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>). Various reports comparing ESWL machines have shown a consistently high stone-free rate and low re-treatment rate with the HM3 lithotriptor (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Portis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portis 2003</LINK>). Included studies that compared ureteroscopic stone retrieval with ESWL treatment using the HM3 device reported no differences in stone-free rates (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK> also reported higher levels of patient satisfaction rates associated with ESWL treatment.</P>
<P>Further research is required in this area to compare different lithotripsy devices with ureteroscopic management of stones. However, economical feasibility generally precludes any single centre from having more than one machine at a time. Further research is also required to assess the results of ESWL treatment in the following areas:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Stone factors: </I>Stone size is a significant factor affecting the stone-free state (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>) following any intervention for treatment of ureteric stones. Preoperative assessment of stone size is vital to decision making in the treatment of ureteric stones. In clinical practice, this is often estimated using plain x-ray of kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB). However, a recent study by (<LINK REF="REF-Nadler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadler 2004</LINK>) has reported CT scan with coronal reconstruction as an alternate and better method to predict stone size. Further research with software reconstruction of CT images is required to address this issue. Stone composition is another factor which influences fragmentation during ESWL treatment. A conventional x-ray KUB can accurately predict stone composition in 39% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Ramakumar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakumar 1999</LINK>). Recent case series (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pareek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareek 2005</LINK>) have reported CT scan Houndsfield units (HU) as a better predictor of stone composition and potential fragmentation during ESWL treatment. This area needs to be explored in future studies.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Patient factors</I>: Body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 has been found to be an independent factor in predicting failure of ESWL treatment in ureteric stones (<LINK REF="REF-Delakas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delakas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pareek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareek 2005</LINK>). None of the studies in this review reported on this important predictor of outcome.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Shock wave technologies: </I>There have been attempts to improve shock wave lithotripsy device designs to maximise stone fragmentation and minimise pain, by reducing the focal point size. However, these designs have higher re-treatment rates owing to the difficulty of keeping the stone in the smaller focal zone. Thus, a larger focal zone might maximise erosive and cavitation forces acting on the stone's surface and increase the stone fragmentation rate. Treatment strategies such as improving per shock efficiency of stone fragmentation with decreasing shock frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2005</LINK>) and synchronous twin-pulse techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Sheir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheir 2005</LINK>), although promising in preliminary reports on stones located within the kidney, need further studies in light of the lack of evidence on the effect on ureteric stones.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Drugs enhancing clearance of ureteric stones following ESWL treatment: </I>Non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kupeli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupeli 2004</LINK>) have reported that tamsulosin enhances clearance of ureteric stones following ESWL treatment. Further large RCTs are required to confirm these data.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Quality of life was not measured in any included studies. Lower patient satisfaction rates were reported following ESWL treatment citing fear and anxiety over residual segments as reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>). However, they did not mention the quantification method applied to assess these two factors.</P>
<P>Economic evaluation reported in three studies showed ESWL treatment to be more cost effective in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pearle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pearle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2009</LINK>) and ureteroscopy in the third (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>). However, two different ESWL devices were used in these three studies and no quality of life data, using stent specific questionnaires, were reported, hence it is difficult to make recommendations. A recent cost-effective study showed that the cost of ESWL was almost GBP 1500 and GBP 2200 for ureteroscopy in patients with ureteric stones, however ureteroscopy of stones larger than 10 mm diameter in the lower ureter cost GBP 500 less than ESWL (<LINK REF="STD-Argyropoulos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Argyropoulos 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-01 14:52:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We identified a number of limitations relating to data available from the included studies:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The studies that enrolled the largest numbers of participants included patients with lower ureteric stones, which have a high rate of spontaneous passage following conservative treatment. With the exception of two studies (two weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Hendrikx-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrikx 1999</LINK>; three weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Peschel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peschel 1999</LINK>), there was no indication about whether periods of conservative treatment were considered before randomisation. This is clearly not a reflection of common clinical practice, particularly in patients with non-obstructing asymptomatic distal ureteric stones. The reported clinical effectiveness of drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Kupeli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kupeli 2000</LINK>) in enhancing clearance of lower ureteric stones was not considered in any studies included in this review.</LI>
<LI>Practice continued to evolve over the period of these studies and so results from different procedures or devices may not be the same; for example the frequent use of holmium:YAG laser for intracorporeal lithotripsy, selective use of postprocedural stents especially following uncomplicated ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones, miniaturisation of ureteroscopic instruments, growing experience with flexible ureteroscopes and new baskets may have reduced the complication rate and need for auxiliary procedures.</LI>
<LI>None of the included studies reported on clinical or radiographic predictors of stone fragmentation in ESWL treatment. Defining these predictors of SWL failure could minimise unnecessary treatment, patient discomfort and cost.</LI>
<LI>We could not consider subgroups of patients on all analyses in the current meta-analysis. There is potential for within and between study heterogeneity related to the type of intracorporeal devices used, types of stones in a particular anatomical area and their correlation to fragmentation when ESWL treatment was used.</LI>
<LI>Analysis of other events such as urinary tract infection and use of antibiotics, were not completed because they were not commonly or consistently reported in studies.</LI>

<P>These issues may limit the generalisation of our review, but nonetheless, an up-to-date appraisal of available data is presented.</P>

<P>Based on current evidence, ureteroscopic retrieval of ureteric calculi increases stone-free rate, but is associated with more complications and longer hospital stays. A change in clinical practice cannot be recommended based on the marked heterogeneity of evidence we identified associated with variances in study design, stones' location, types of ureteroscope, intracorporeal lithotripsy devices, policy variations in stenting after ureteroscopy, and time to follow-up. The burden of stones on the patient, the urologist's experience and availability of resources and appropriate technologies remain the principal criteria to inform treatment choice for the management of ureteric stones. Current clinical practice continues to be based on evidence derived from a number of case series referred to in the AUA recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Preminger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preminger 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-22 14:29:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>There is a need to re-evaluate treatment regimens as techniques, technologies and experience in the management of ureteric stone disease grows and increases. Large, multicentre, well designed RCTs and high quality reporting are required to make comparisons among essential parameters such as ureteroscopes, ESWL devices, intracorporeal lithotripsy resources, and measurement of health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Future studies should ensure that standardised definitions of stone-free state, auxiliary procedures, complications, concealed treatment allocation and blinded outcome assessment are applied. Research is also required to accurately measure stone burden, predict stone fragmentation and assess the design of lithotripsy devices.</P>

<LI>Francis X Keeley: My clinical practice involves the use of both ESWL and ureteroscopy for stones. I have given lectures and received honoraria for teaching both for operating techniques and didactic educational material on kidney stones, upper tract tumors, PUJ obstruction and kidney cancer. I do not believe that any of the above affects my views on the need for a trial on the subject of ureteric stones, the assessment of the literature, nor how the trial should be run.</LI>
