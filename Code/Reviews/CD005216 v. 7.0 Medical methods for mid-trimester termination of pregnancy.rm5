<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-20 08:18:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many medical methods for planned termination of pregnancy in the second trimester of pregnancy (abortion after three months). We did a search of the scientific literature to find out which is the best method. We identified 38 studies and came to the conclusion that misoprostol is the drug of choice for medical pregnancy termination, preferably in combination with mifepristone which facilitates the effectiveness of misoprostol. Misoprostol works best when it is administered into the vagina. Women who had previously given birth could take misoprostol by mouth (under the tongue). Irrespective of the medication used for second trimester termination there is a considerable risk of surgical intervention because of vaginal bleeding or incomplete abortion.</P>

<P>With the improvement of ultrasound technology, the likelihood of detection of major fetal structural anomalies in mid-pregnancy has increased considerably.

<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining medical regimens for termination of pregnancy of a singleton living fetus between 12-28 weeks' gestation were analysed. The outcome measures were the induction to abortion interval, abortion rate within 24 hours, need for surgical evacuation, blood loss, uterine rupture, pain, and side-effects.Trials including &gt;20% fetal death, multiple pregnancies, previous uterine scars and regimens which involved cervical preparation were excluded.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:02:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourty RCTs were included, addressing various agents for pregnancy termination and methods of administration. When used alone, misoprostol was an effective inductive agent, though it appeared to be more effective in combination with mifepristone. However, the evidence from RCTs is limited.</P>
<P>Misoprostol was preferably administered vaginally, although among multiparous women sublingual administration appeared equally effective. A range of doses of vaginally administered misoprostol has been used. No randomised trials comparing doses of misoprostol were identified; however low doses of misoprostol appear to be associated with fewer side-effects while moderate doses appear to be more efficient in completing abortion. Four RCTs showed that the induction to abortion interval with 3-hourly vaginal administration of prostaglandins is shorter than 6-hourly administration without an increase in side-effects.</P>
<P>Many studies reported the need for surgical evacuation. Indications for surgical evacuation include retained products of the placenta and heavy vaginal bleeding. Fewer women required surgical evacuation when misoprostol was administrated vaginally compared with women receiving intra-amniotical PGF<SUB>2a</SUB>. Mild, self-limiting diarrhoea was more common among women who received misoprostol compared to other agents.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-06 13:49:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical abortion in the second trimester using the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol appeared to have the highest efficacy and shortest abortion time interval. Where mifepristone is not available, misoprostol alone is a reasonable alternative. The optimal route for administering misoprostol is vaginally, preferably using tablets at 3-hourly intervals. Apart from pain, the side-effects of vaginal misoprostol are usually mild and self limiting. Conclusions from this review are limited by the gestational age ranges and variable medical regimens, including dosing, administrative routes and intervals of medication, of the included trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-20 12:21:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the wide-scale introduction of prenatal screening programmes the issue of second trimester abortion has become increasingly relevant, in particular for women whose pregnancies are complicated by a serious fetal anomaly (<LINK REF="REF-Asch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 2008</LINK>). Additionally, there are many reasons other than fetal anomalies for which women seek abortion in the midtrimester (<LINK REF="REF-Drey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingham 2008</LINK>). Second trimester abortion for fetal structural anomalies may have advantages over surgical abortion as it is operator independent and the intact fetus may be preferable for feto-pathological examination (<LINK REF="REF-Akgun-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akgun 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaksen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaksen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaksen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaksen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaasen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaasen 2006</LINK>). Medical abortion, however, also has several limitations including the need for the hospitalisation, the need for surgical removal of (the retained products of) the placenta when indicated, and the emotional impact of the process of labor and delivery on women who choose to end a pregnancy.</P>
<P>Medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy is considered successful if complete expulsion of the conceptus occurs without the need for surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Christin_x002d_Maitre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christin-Maitre 2000</LINK>). Beyond the first trimester, definitions differ but generally consider expulsion of the fetus separate from management of the placenta.</P>
<P>Several regimens for second trimester abortion have been published. Most of these are based on misoprostol or gemeprost, which are synthetic prostaglandin E<SUB>1 </SUB>analogues (PGE<SUB>1</SUB>), and used alone or misoprostol combined with mifepristone. Comparison of medical methods with surgical evacuation for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy is the subject of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Lohr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lohr 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Agents used for medical abortion</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Prostaglandins</HEADING>
<P>Prostaglandins and their analogues are widely used for medical termination of pregnancy. Prostaglandins are produced by almost every tissue in the body and play a major role in human reproduction and in many other vital processes. To date, nine groups (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) and three types (PG1, PG2, PG3) of prostaglandins have been identified. Prostaglandins of the F and E series are the most important prostaglandins involved in pregnancy, labor, delivery and puerperium. PG receptors are always present in myometrial tissue.</P>
<P>Misoprostol (PGE<SUB>1</SUB>) is increasingly used for second trimester termination of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 2005</LINK>). Misoprostol is marketed for use in the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease, and it is registered for obstetric indications, including abortion, in a few countries. It is inexpensive, stable at room temperature and it is rapidly absorbed by vaginal, sublingual, buccal and oral routes (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zieman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zieman 1997</LINK>). Moreover, misoprostol is reportedly associated with few, relatively minor side-effects. Serious complications such as uterine rupture are rare.</P>
<P>Gemeprost (PGE<SUB>1</SUB>) is formulated as a vaginal suppository which requires refrigeration, and is not as widely available as misoprostol. Like other prostaglandins, it induces uterine contractions and cervical softening.</P>
<P>Dinoprost (PGF<SUB>2&#945;</SUB>) and dinoprostone (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>) are natural prostaglandins which induce uterine activity and are available for intravenous, intra-amniotic and extra-amniotic use.</P>
<P>Carboprost (15 methyl PGF<SUB>2&#945;</SUB>) can be given by intramuscular or intra-amniotic injection and its methyl ester can be given as vaginal suppository. Carboprost and its methyl ester are both effective in inducing uterine contractions.</P>
<P>Sulprostone (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>) is used intravenously. The intramuscular preparation of sulprostone is no longer available because it was associated with cardiovascular complications, such as acute myocardial infarction and hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Ulmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulmann 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Uterotonic agents other than prostaglandins</HEADING>
<P>Mifepristone, also known as RU 486 or RU 38486, is a 19-norsteroid that specifically blocks the receptors for progesterone and glucosteroids. It is used as pretreatment 24 to 48 hours prior to the induction of first trimester abortion with a prostaglandin analogue. It sensitizes the myometrium of the uterus to prostaglandin (<LINK REF="REF-Belanger-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belanger 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swahn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swahn 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oxytocin is released physiologically by the posterior pituitary and stimulates uterine contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocin increases with gestational age.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Injection techniques</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Intra-amniotic instillation</HEADING>
<P>Several chemical solutions for intra-amniotic injection techniques have been used, including formalin, glucose, hypertonic saline, urea and PGF<SUB>2&#945;</SUB>. When using hypertonic saline, a spinal needle is passed through the abdominal wall into the amniotic cavity. A variable amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is removed and replaced by 150 to 250 ml of 20% saline chloride solution that will induce abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-and-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman and Gemzell-Danielsson 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Extra-amniotic instillation</HEADING>
<P>Instead of passing a spinal needle directly into the amniotic sac, effective irritants, such as ethacridine lactate or PGF<SUB>2&#945;</SUB>, can be introduced through the cervix into the extra-amniotic space, that is, the space between the uterine wall and the fetal membranes. Ethacridine lactate is an organic compound based on acridine. Its primary use is as an antiseptic in solutions of 0.1%. When used as an agent for second trimester abortion, it is thought to stimulate endogenous prostaglandin production and subsequent uterine contractions. Up to 150 ml of 0.1% ethacridine is instilled into the extra-amniotic space using a Foley catheter. Oxytocin intravenous administration is often used concomitantly to expedite fetal expulsion (<LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-and-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman and Gemzell-Danielsson 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of the problem or issue</HEADING>
<P>Second trimester abortions constitute 10% to 15% of all induced abortions worldwide but are responsible for two-thirds of major abortion-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Drey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1998</LINK>). Medical methods for second trimester induced abortion have improved considerably during the last decades in terms of efficacy and safety; however, a variety of regimens remain in use.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-20 12:18:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of improved ultrasound technology, the prenatal detection of fetal structural anomalies during the second trimester of pregnancy has improved substantially. For this reason, the demand for medical methods to terminate pregnancy during the second trimester has also increased (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1998</LINK>). Additionally, there are a number of other reasons why women seek abortion in the mid-trimester. There are many medical regimens for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy. This review aims to identify the most effective medical regimens for mid-trimester abortion with the fewest side-effects.</P>

<P>The main outcome measures were the induction to abortion interval and the number of complete abortions within 24 hours. The primary endpoint for the abortion interval is expulsion of the fetus. The secondary endpoint for the abortion interval is the expulsion of the placenta. In addition, other secondary outcome measures included the need for surgical evacuation (non-emergency procedure, emergency procedure, or not specified, including manual removal of the placenta), blood loss (measured, need for blood transfusion or clinically relevant drop in haemoglobin), uterine rupture, pain resulting from the procedure (reported by the women or measured by use of analgesics), nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> includes whether a surgical intervention was performed routinely in the study.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential confounding</HEADING>
<P>The sensitivity of the myometrium for uterotonic drugs increases with gestational age. Hence, the longer the gestation, the less uterotonic drugs are needed. Apart from gestational age, parity could also be viewed as a potential confounder as multiparous women appear to have a shorter time interval to abortion. Differential treatment effects could theoretically be ascribed by differences in gestational age or parity.

<P>A form was designed to facilitate the process of data extraction which was performed by two of the reviewers independently. There were no discrepancies between the reviewers in either decision of inclusion/exclusion of studies or in data extraction.</P>
<P>Trials were not excluded based on an arbitrary cut-off limit regarding losses to follow up. Subgroup analyses were planned for early and late second trimester abortions as the performance of methods may differ with gestational age.</P>
<P>Trials describing the use of quinine were excluded. Trials including more than 20% fetal death at the onset of treatment (unless separate analysis was available), multiple pregnancies, women with uterine scars (if reportedly included in the trial) and regimens which included cervical preparation prior to the abortion procedure were excluded.</P>

In total, 306 women were eligible for analysis. The largest trial in this analysis was conducted by Ngai, comparing the oral use of 400 &#956;g and the vaginal use of 200 &#956;g of misoprostol, both combined with 200 mg mifepristone administered orally 36 to 48 hours in advance. In addition to this comparison, both groups received either vaginal or oral placebo tablets. Ho 1997 conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing the use of 200 &#956;g of misoprostol orally combined with a vaginal placebo to the vaginal use of 200 &#956;g misoprostol combined with an oral placebo, each arm combined with 200 mg mifepristone. The vaginal use of 200 &#956;g misoprostol was superior (MD 13.00, 95% CI 2.77 to 23.23) to the oral use of 200 &#956;g misoprostol (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

In regards to the induction-to-abortion interval, El Refaey 1995 did not provide a standard deviation in addition to estimates which precluded the inclusion of these data in the meta-analysis. The mean induction to abortion interval was 6.0 hrs (95% CI 5.0 to 7.2) and 6.7 hrs (95% CI 5.8 to 7.6) for the oral and the vaginal groups respectively (not significant). No significant difference was found between the oral and vaginal use of misoprostol in terms of induction-to-abortion interval.

No difference was found between the vaginal or the sublingual use of misoprostol for the induction to abortion interval in one smaller study (<LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>). Von Hertzen was not included in this analyses, because no mean (SD) was provided. However, authors did provide median (range). In the vaginal group, the induction to abortion interval was longer (median 12.3, range 3.2 to 48.0) than the sublingual group (median 12.0, range 4.1 to 61.8). However, this difference was not significant. The abortion rate after 24 hours with vaginal use was superior to the sublingual use (<LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>) (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.83). However, the significant heterogeneity for the analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>) (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%) must be noted despite use of identical regimens precludes confidence in these combined estimates. The heterogeneity between these data could potentially be explained by the difference in included numbers of multigravidas between both trials; Tang included 36% to 39%, while Bhattacharjee included 80% of women studied. Because of the possibility that among nulliparous women, vaginal misoprostol is associated with higher rates of complete abortion within 24 hours, the analysis were separated. Vaginal misoprostol is associated with significantly higher rates of complete abortion within 24 hours among nulliparous women (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.54), while among multiparous women, there is no difference between vaginal or sublingual administration (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.47). Von Hertzen conducted a stratified analysis by parity because there was a highly significant interaction of treatment by parity. When success rates at 24 h were analysed according to parity, vaginal administration was clearly superior to sublingual administration in nulliparous women (87.3% versus 68.5%) but the difference between treatments was not present among parous women: 84.7% (vaginal) versus 88.5% (sublingual).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-20 12:15:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Second trimester medical abortion regimens have evolved greatly over the past 20 years with increasing availability of prostaglandin analogues and anti-progesterone agents such as mifepristone. Older regimens such as instillation of hypertonic saline or prostaglandin F<SUB>2&#945;</SUB> although effective in provoking abortion, were associated with higher rates of serious adverse events than are modern methods (<LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-and-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman and Gemzell-Danielsson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomised comparisons included in this review demonstrate that misoprostol is the prostaglandin analogue of choice: it is as effective or more effective than other studied prostaglandins and has the preferable characteristics of heat stability and multiple administrative routes. However, in settings where prostaglandins are not available for second trimester medical abortion, extra-amniotic instillation of ethacridine lactate may be an alternative (Comparisons 23, 24) (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2010</LINK>). However, limited information is available percentage of women needing a surgical intervention for incomplete abortion and the safety outcomes of ethacridine lactate, given the small number of subjects studied. When using extra-amniotic instillation of drugs, the catheter tends to be expelled as the cervix dilates, before the abortion process is self-sustaining. For this reason, supplementary infusions of oxytocin are commonly used (Kelekci 2006; WHO technical report series) which also increases the associated costs. Furthermore, intra-amniotic injection of drugs is potentially dangerous as accidental injection into maternal tissue or placenta can result in local tissue damage or harmful absorption into the maternal circulation (WHO technical report series). For this reason, the drugs should only be given by skilled operators. Intra-amniotic injection of drugs may also induce infection into the amniotic cavity (WHO technical report series).</P>
<P>Misoprostol when used alone is an effective inductive agent; however, it appears more efficient when combined with mifepristone, although the evidence from randomised trials is limited. In fact, there is only one relatively small randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Kapp-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kapp 2007</LINK>) comparing the effect of misoprostol + mifepristone with misoprostol only (Comparison 2). This study demonstrated that the addition of mifepristone in second trimester abortion reduces the induction to abortion interval from 18 hours (95% CI 1 to 22) to 10 hours (95% CI 8 to12), while the occurrence of side-effects in both groups was similar. Indirect evidence, however, suggests a beneficial effect of adding mifepristone to prostaglandin tablets or gel since the induction-to-abortion interval is generally shorter in regimens using mifepristone + prostaglandins (Comparisons 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7) than those using prostaglandins alone (Comparisons 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19). Additionally, mifepristone is known to potentiate the uterine effect of misoprostol and is superior to misoprostol alone in first trimester abortion.</P>
<P>Misoprostol may be administered by different routes, the oral route being the least effective (Comparisons 3, 4 and 5). For regimens using misoprostol, vaginal dosing appears to be the most efficient when compared to both oral and sublingual regimens. Among multiparous women undergoing medical abortion with misoprostol alone, sublingual administration appears equally effective as vaginal administration. No study of second trimester medical abortion has compared vaginal with buccal administration of misoprostol.</P>
<P>The optimal dose of vaginally administered misoprostol is difficult to ascertain since there are no randomised studies comparing various dosing schemes for vaginal administration. Four randomised clinical trials showed that the induction to abortion interval with 3-hourly vaginal administration of prostaglandins was significantly shorter than 6-hourly administration without significant increase in side-effects (Comparisons 15 and 16).</P>
<P>There is insufficient data to make any gestational, age-specific recommendations on the dosage and regimen for abortion. Since the uterus becomes more sensitive to prostaglandins with increasing gestational age, reducing the dosage or frequency of administration should be considered at later gestational ages (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2007</LINK>). The age range considered in this review includes 12 through 28 weeks of gestation. Overall, from the design of the included studies, there is no indication for confounding by gestational age. </P>
<P>Other considerations for second trimester medical abortion regimens which could not be addressed in this review include the effect on the abortion process of the use of pre-procedure feticide to avoid the occurrence of a fetus with signs of life at abortion, and therapeutic strategies for women who have not aborted after 24 hours of treatment.</P>
<P>There are considerable differences in practices regarding the management of the placenta following the expulsion of the fetus. We considered surgical evacuation any procedure where an instrument was introduced into the uterine cavity. Indications for surgical evacuation include the removal of retained products of the placenta and heavy vaginal bleeding, where reported. Fewer women required surgical evacuation when misoprostol was administrated vaginally when compared to women having mid-trimester abortion by intra-amniotic instillation of PGF<SUB>2&#945; </SUB>(OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87) (Comparison 9). Apart from the latter finding, there were no statistically significant differences in reported frequencies of surgical removal of the placenta among women undergoing misoprostol-induced abortions when compared to other regimens.</P>
<P>Diarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction that has been reported consistently with misoprostol, but it is usually mild and self limiting. Nausea and vomiting may also occur and generally resolves in two to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2007</LINK>). Uterine rupture is a rare but serious complication of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy, especially in women with a previous uterine scar (<LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2009</LINK>). Uterine rupture is uncommon and did not occur during any of the included trials; thus, its relative risk with differing medical regimens are not informed by this review. </P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-20 12:11:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-six randomised controlled trials were included in the review. The included studies addressed the various agents for pregnancy termination and methods of administration which were grouped into 28 comparisons. When used alone, misoprostol is an effective inductive agent, though it appears to be more effective in combination with mifepristone.</P>
<P>Misoprostol is preferably administered vaginally, although among multiparous women sublingual administration appears equally effective. The optimal dose of vaginally administered misoprostol could not be determined, as no randomised studies could be identified. Low doses of misoprostol are associated with fewer side-effects, while moderate doses are more efficient in completing abortion. Four randomised controlled trials showed that the induction to abortion interval with 3-hourly vaginal administration of prostaglandins is significantly shorter than 6-hourly administration without a significant increase in side-effects.</P>
<P>Many studies reported the need for surgical evacuation in a considerable number of women undergoing mid-trimester termination. Indications for surgical evacuation include the removal of retained products of the placenta and heavy vaginal bleeding. Fewer women required surgical evacuation when misoprostol was administrated vaginally when compared with those having intra-amniotic instillation of PGF<SUB>2a</SUB>. Apart from the latter finding, there were no statistically significant differences in reported frequencies of surgical removal of the placenta among women undergoing misoprostol-induced abortions when compared to other regimens. Diarrhoea was more common among women having misoprostol when compared to other agents. However, diarrhoea is reportedly mild and self limiting.</P>

<P>The results of this review suggest that the most efficient regimen for medical abortion in the second trimester is the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol. If mifepristone is not available, misoprostol alone is a reasonable alternative. The available data suggest that vaginal administration is the most efficient route of administration, and 3-hourly intervals of administration are more effective than 6-hourly intervals. Meta-analysis of the various randomised controlled trials on misoprostol was hampered by the heterogeneity in medical regimens used among the included trials. Included studies indicate that adverse effects of misoprostol are usually mild and dose dependant. Apart from pain resulting from uterine contractions, diarrhoea is the most common side-effect that has been reported consistently with misoprostol. There are considerable differences in practices regarding the management of the placenta following the expulsion of the fetus.</P>

<P>This review highlights the importance of developing a standardised medical method for women requesting mid-trimester abortion. Further research is needed to evaluate the gestational-age-specific dosage of misoprostol for mid-trimester abortion. In addition, more data are needed to guide medical and/or surgical strategies for women with a uterine scar resulting from prior hysterotomy (see <LINK REF="REF-Berghella-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghella 2009</LINK>) and for those who failed to abort within 24 hours or five doses of misoprostol. Finally, more research is needed to evaluate the additional value, optimal dose and timing of mifepristone when used in combination with misoprostol.</P>
