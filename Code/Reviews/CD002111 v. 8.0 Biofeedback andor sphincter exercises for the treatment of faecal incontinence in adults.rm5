<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-11 12:06:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leaking stool) can be a very embarrassing and socially restricting problem. There are many possible causes, including childbirth damage to the muscles which control bowel movements. Exercises to strengthen these muscles and 'biofeedback', where equipment is used to show people how to use the muscles properly, are often recommended. There was some evidence from trials suggesting that these treatments are helpful. If patients who have tried and failed other simpler treatments, such as changing their diet or using medications, are selected then biofeedback using computer equipment or rectal balloon is more beneficial than exercises alone. Exercises and electrical stimulation used in the anus may be more helpful than vaginal exercises for women with faecal incontinence after childbirth. About half of the 21 trials were at low risk of bias. They compared different combinations of treatments and different outcome measures, making comparison between them difficult. However, a small number of the larger recent trials provide better evidence.</P>

<P>The combined data of two trials showed that the number of people failing to achieve full continence was significantly lower when electrical stimulation was added to biofeedback compared against biofeedback alone (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78).</P>

<P>The limited number of identified trials together with methodological weaknesses of many do not allow a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence. We found some evidence that biofeedback and electrical stimulation may enhance the outcome of treatment compared to electrical stimulation alone or exercises alone. Exercises appear to be less effective than an implanted sacral nerve stimulator. While there is a suggestion that some elements of biofeedback therapy and sphincter exercises may have a therapeutic effect, this is not certain. Larger well-designed trials are needed to enable safe conclusions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Faecal incontinence has been variously defined. An international consensus meeting has recommended: "Faecal incontinence is the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool that is a social or hygienic problem" (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Faecal incontinence is a common healthcare problem, affecting 5% to 10% of community-dwelling adults (Macmillan 2004; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 2009</LINK>), with 1% to 2% experiencing significant impact on daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2002</LINK>). It becomes more common with advancing age and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2002</LINK>). It is a symptom which is particularly embarrassing and socially unacceptable, and many sufferers do not seek professional help (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1996</LINK>). Faecal incontinence has a major negative impact on physical and psychological health and lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-Boreham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boreham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotterill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotterill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2007</LINK>), with severe social restrictions in many instances (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Faecal incontinence has many possible causes, including (among others) obstetric or other trauma, or a congenital abnormality of one or both of the anal sphincters or the pelvic floor muscles; loose stool or intestinal hurry; neurological disease or injury causing sensory or motor impairment to the continence mechanism; local anorectal pathology; rectal loading and subsequent 'overflow' leakage in frail or immobile individuals; and physical or mental disabilities affecting toilet habits. For many people, a combination of structural, physiological and psycho-social factors (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuteja-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuteja 2004</LINK>) combine to cause faecal incontinence.</P>
<P>It is generally recognised that symptoms may be of urgency with urge faecal incontinence, usually consequent upon external striated voluntary sphincter weakness or disruption, or loose stool or intestinal hurry; or of passive soiling in the absence of an urge to defecate, secondary to smooth muscle internal anal sphincter dysfunction, local pathology or incomplete evacuation. Recent advances in investigation techniques (notably ano-rectal physiology studies and endo-anal ultrasound) allow more accurate characterisation of the underlying cause for each patient. However, for many conditions the treatment options are limited, relying mainly on surgery and constipating drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention and how it might work</HEADING>
<P>Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a well-established therapy for the treatment of urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2010</LINK>), but has been less commonly reported for faecal incontinence. The external anal sphincter is continuous with the puborectalis muscle and, as a striated muscle, is theoretically amenable to the same re-educative and training techniques. The role of the ano-rectal angle, maintained by the pubo-rectalis muscle, is controversial but is believed to be important in faecal continence. It is not established whether pelvic floor muscle training can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by patients, and the two will be considered together for the purposes of this review, with the use of vaginal or anal palpation, teaching, or biofeedback made explicit. The purpose of the exercises is stated variously as enhancing the strength, speed, or endurance of voluntary anal sphincter contraction. Some have also suggested that there could be an effect on resting closure pressure of the anus. Reported exercise regimens for faecal incontinence vary widely in terms of the type, number and intensity of exercises taught (for example maximal squeeze and how long to attempt to hold it; submaximal endurance squeeze; fast twitch squeezes), how many per day and in what pattern, and in length of time the exercises are suggested to be performed for. Some have reported a single regimen for all patients (for example 10 squeezes of 5 seconds each five times per day); others have individualised the exercise programme, depending on the initial muscle strength and endurance, on the principle of improving muscle performance by 'overload' (aiming to exercise at a level just above current ability). There is no consensus among professionals on the best exercise regimen for faecal incontinence.</P>
<P>Biofeedback uses equipment to record or amplify and then feed back to the patient activities of the body. Originally based on the principles of operant conditioning (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1974</LINK>), it is a very commonly reported clinical treatment for faecal incontinence in the colorectal and gastroenterology literature. Reviews of large numbers of case series, in the era before randomised controlled trials became the accepted method for evaluating the efficacy of treatment, have concluded that biofeedback is an effective treatment for the majority of people with faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Heymen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymen 2001</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2001</LINK>). Many different therapies have been used with people with faecal incontinence under the label of 'biofeedback'. Early studies concentrated on operant conditioning to enhance what was presumed to be a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to the reflex inhibition of the internal anal sphincter when the rectum filled (recto-anal inhibitory reflex). It has subsequently been suggested that this external sphincter reaction is in fact not a reflex but a voluntary response (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1981</LINK>). Other studies have focused on teaching the patient to discriminate progressively smaller volumes of distension of a rectal balloon, and to respond appropriately (by contracting the external sphincter) and as promptly as possible, abolishing any delay in sensation or reaction to it. Some have disregarded these elements and focused entirely on improving the strength or endurance of external anal sphincter contraction.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Three main modalities have been described</HEADING>
<P>1. Rectal sensitivity training. A rectal balloon is gradually distended with air or water and the patient is asked to report the first sensation of rectal filling. Once this threshold volume is determined, repeated re-inflations of the balloon are performed with the objective being to teach the patient to feel the distension at progressively lower volumes. The rationale is that some patients are found to have high threshold volumes and if the patient detects stool arriving sooner there is more possibility to either find a toilet or use an anal squeeze, or both. Conversely, the same technique can also be used to teach the patient to tolerate progressively larger volumes, in those with urgency and a hypersensitive rectum.</P>
<P>2. Strength training. Biofeedback techniques have been used to demonstrate to the patient anal sphincter pressures or activity, thereby enabling teaching of anal sphincter exercises and giving feedback on performance and progress. This can be achieved by using electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or anal ultrasound. The patient is encouraged by seeing or hearing the signal to enhance squeeze strength and endurance. There is no consensus on an optimum exercise regimen for use at home between sessions, nor on the number of squeezes, the frequency of exercises or treatment duration, with different authors describing very different programmes.</P>
<P>3. Co-ordination training. Some authors have described a three-balloon system for biofeedback for faecal incontinence. One distension balloon is situated in the rectum, the second and third smaller pressure-recording balloons are situated in the upper and lower anal canal. Rectal distension triggers the rectal-anal inhibitory reflex. This momentary anal relaxation is a point of vulnerability for people with faecal incontinence and incontinence can occur at this time. By distending the rectal balloon and showing the patient this consequent pressure drop, the aim is to teach the patient to counteract this by a voluntary anal squeeze that is hard enough and for long enough for resting pressure to return to its baseline level.</P>
<P>The three methods are not mutually exclusive, and many protocols combine two or three elements together. There has been considerable variation in protocols, such as the number or frequency of sessions, intensity and duration of exercises and instructions for practice at home. Some studies have included other elements, such as patient teaching, diet and fluid advice and titration of medication, although many fail to mention these other elements or give details. Some have used additional surface electrode electrical stimulation of the anal sphincter muscles, which is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hosker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosker 2007</LINK>). There is widespread agreement on the crucial role of patient motivation and the patient-therapist interaction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>There are numerous case series reporting on biofeedback for faecal incontinence, nearly all of which have reported positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Heymen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2001</LINK>). Only one published study has reported negative results (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tets-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tets 1996</LINK>). It would be easy to conclude from case series that biofeedback or exercises are an effective intervention. However, it is known that there is a publication bias in favour of publishing positive results and that there is an effect of intervention per se, especially in many functional gastrointestinal disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>). Delivering a programme of biofeedback or anal sphincter exercises, or both, inevitably involves a complex combination of patient-therapist interaction, patient education and formal or informal advice on a range of related issues. Randomised controlled trials provide the best evidence of the efficacy of health care interventions. More complex interventions are likely to involve more clinic attendances for the patients and more costs. Patients who fail to respond to conservative treatments are often referred for costly surgical treatments such as sacral nerve stimulation. If they have not tried the most effective available conservative interventions, they may undergo surgery unnecessarily or alternatively decide to live with distressing symptoms which might have responded to the best available treatment.</P>
<P>The aim of the present review is to systematically search for and combine evidence from all relevant randomised controlled trials on the effects of biofeedback or sphincter exercises, or both, for the treatment of faecal incontinence in order to provide the best evidence currently available on which to base recommendations for clinical practice and for future research.</P>

Relevant trials were identified from the Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which is described under the Incontinence Group's <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">module</A> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. The register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. The date of the most recent search of the register was 24 January 2012.</P>
<P>The trials in the Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register are also contained in CENTRAL. The Incontinence Group Trials Register was searched using the Group's own keyword system. The search terms used were:</P>
<P>({design.rct* or design.cct*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({TOPIC.FAECAL.INCON* or TOPIC.FAECAL.NEUROGENIC*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({INTVENT.PHYS.PFMT* or INTVENT.PHYS.BIOFEED* or INTVENT.PHYS.SphincterExercise* or INTVENT.PHYS.exercise*})<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 12, ISI ResearchSoft).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials selection</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (CN, JC) examined all the citations and abstracts derived from the electronic search strategy. Reports of potentially relevant trials were retrieved in full. Both review authors independently applied the selection criteria to trials reports. They were not blind to the names of trials' authors, institutions or journals. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias of identified trials was assessed independently by the two review authors using the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). This takes into account the quality of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, the description of dropouts and withdrawals, whether data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and whether therapists, participants or outcome assessors were blind to the treatments provided.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Where the method of allocation concealment was not clearly reported the authors were contacted, if possible, for clarification.</P>
<P>Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Studies were excluded if they not meet the pre-specified inclusion criteria. The list of excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion are summarised in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data extraction from the included studies was undertaken independently by the review authors. Only published data have been used for the purposes of this review. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). Any difference of opinion was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Missing information was sought from trialists, if necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>Data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan) software.</P>
<P>For each trial, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes using a fixed-effect model. Continuous variables were processed using mean and standard deviation values. Where the results were reported in terms of the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM), the standard deviation (SD) was calculated using the standard statistical equation: SD = SEM x square root (sample size). Differences between groups were presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) with accompanying 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>All outcomes were reported in terms of unfavourable events. This implied that risk ratios less than one or a WMD less than zero indicated a reduction in unfavourable events (that is a beneficial treatment effect). Therefore, the benefits of the experimental treatment were all displayed on the same side of the line of no effect.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 1985</LINK>) allocated alternate patients to exercises or a control group.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies prospectively randomised patients to one of two (<LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Healy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Healy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilnyckyj-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ilnyckyj 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahony-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahony 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markwell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Markwell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naimy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Naimy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tjandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tjandra 2008</LINK>), three (<LINK REF="STD-Hinninghofen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hinninghofen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>) or four groups (<LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Latimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Latimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 1990</LINK>) which attempted to evaluate different components of biofeedback therapy had a complex design. One trial (Latimer 1984) reported the results of single case experiments employed with eight incontinent patients randomly allocated to different components of biofeedback (A, B, C or D). The single case designs were A B A C A D A or A C A B A D A. For each patient, results of the pre-treatment phase were compared to those of the last follow-up. Results at the end of each treatment phase were either not reported or provided in a form unsuitable for statistical analyses, rendering the interpretation of trial findings difficult. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 1990</LINK>), which investigated some of the factors thought to be responsible for the improvement of patients undergoing biofeedback therapy, was a 'two-phase randomised trial'. Patients were initially randomised to one of two groups for sensory retraining (phase II); before and after treatment results were reported for both intervention groups. At the end of phase I all patients were again randomly assigned to one of two groups for either strength or coordination training. After a month they were crossed over. Results of the cross-over phases were not clearly reported. Only results of the final assessment were given for phase II.</P>
<P>One trial randomised patients to two groups using a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-McHugh-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McHugh 1986</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Each of the trials, except two (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2011</LINK>), were carried out in a single hospital centre; these were in a variety of countries. Schwandner 2010 was a multi centre trial which involved eight centres in Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In all studies where information on gender was reported, the majority of participants were female. Most studies enrolled patients with mixed aetiologies. Four studies included women with obstetric trauma only (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahony-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahony 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naimy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Naimy 2007</LINK>). One study included older patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 1985</LINK>). One study included only patients undergoing surgical anal sphincter repair (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>). Some investigators only included patients who had failed previous dietary and medication interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2009</LINK>). In some studies patients with specific diagnoses such as rectal prolapse were excluded, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (see table 'Characteristics of included studies' for details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria in each study).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>One study used a dual-balloon system with visual or auditory feedback of anal pressure. Patients were encouraged to contract the anal sphincter in response to rectal distension. Exercises during the session (one hour per week for six weeks, commenced three months following anal sphincter repair surgery) and home practice included maximal, submaximal and fast-twitch contractions practised at least twice daily. The control group had no therapist contact, biofeedback or exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>). Another study compared rectal balloon therapy with PFMT against PFMT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two other studies included a no biofeedback or exercises group. In one of these studies the control group received one-to-one time and advice (Norton 2003); in the other study the control group received no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 1985</LINK>). Three studies included a no-biofeedback exercise group which involved exercises taught digitally (<LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>) or verbally (<LINK REF="STD-Ilnyckyj-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ilnyckyj 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heyman 2009 compared manometric biofeedback and pelvic floor exercises against exercises alone.</P>
<P>Bartlett compared a standard clinical protocol (sustained submaximal anal and pelvic floor exercises versus an alternative group (rapid squeeze plus sustained submaximal exercises) with biofeedback in both arms of the study. There were five outpatient sessions over eight weeks. The first four sessions were weekly; participants then practised techniques for four weeks before returning for their final session (<LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Markwell (<LINK REF="STD-Markwell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Markwell 2006</LINK>) compared dietary modification, stool bulking agents, specific pelvic floor muscle action using abdominal muscles and defecation training compared with dietary modification, stool bulking agents and conventional pelvic floor exercises.</P>
<P>Tjandra (<LINK REF="STD-Tjandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tjandra 2008</LINK>) compared optimum medical therapy, including pelvic floor exercises, bulking agents, dietary management of fluid and fibres, with a team of physiotherapists and dietitians. Attendance varied with need, usually monthly for six months then two-monthly. This group was compared against two phase sacral nerve stimulation: peripheral nerve evaluation for at least seven days; patients with a 50% reduction or more in incontinence episodes were surgically implanted with a permanent sacral nerve stimulator.</P>
<P>Two studies compared biofeedback and exercises against biofeedback, exercises and electrical stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahony-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahony 2004</LINK>). The Fynes study (<LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>) randomised women with post-natal faecal incontinence to either vaginal pressure non-computer biofeedback (Peritron) with a nurse (weekly 30 minute sessions for 12 weeks) with fast and slow twitch exercises, or to computer-assisted anal probe EMG biofeedback (fast and slow twitch exercises) with a physiotherapist plus anal electrical stimulation at 20 Hz and 50 Hz. The Mahoney study (<LINK REF="STD-Mahony-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahony 2004</LINK>) likewise recruited women with post-natal incontinence, randomised to have anal EMG biofeedback to perform fast and slow twitch contractions (10 minutes), with or without additional anal electrical stimulation at 35 Hz (20 minutes) at weekly sessions for 12 weeks. The Mahony study randomised women to intra-anal EMG biofeedback with or without anal electrical stimulation.</P>
<P>Schwandner 2010 (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2010</LINK>) compared "Triple target training" where amplitude-modulated middle-frequency electrical stimulation was combined with electromyography biofeedback and compared against electromyography biofeedback carried out at home daily for 20 minutes for a duration of nine months.</P>
<P>Schwandner 2011 (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2011</LINK>) compared "Triple target training" where amplitude-modulated middle-frequency electrical stimulation was combined with electromyography biofeedback and compared against low frequency electrostimulation.</P>
<P>Healy (<LINK REF="STD-Healy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Healy 2006</LINK>) compared endo-anal pudendal nerve stimulation daily at home against attending a physiotherapy department for endo-anal electrical stimulation under supervision. They alternated biofeedback and electrical stimulation using augmented biofeedback.</P>
<P>Hinninghofen (<LINK REF="STD-Hinninghofen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hinninghofen 2003</LINK>) included three different groups, sphincter training compared with electrical stimulation, sphincter training with biofeedback and pelvic floor training without support; the intervention lasted three months.</P>
<P>Naimy (<LINK REF="STD-Naimy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Naimy 2007</LINK>) compared biofeedback with electrical stimulation. Biofeedback consisted of Neuro Trac ETS: using an Anuform anal probe. Quick 3 second squeeze; 10 second squeeze; squeeze for as long as it kept 50% of 3 second amplitude. Each squeeze was repeated five times with equal rest time between. The initial session was for 30 minutes with a 30 minute follow-up session one week later; then daily 30 minute sessions at home for eight weeks. Electrical stimulation consisted of Neuro Trac ETS: 30 or 40 Hz at alternate sessions; pulse width 200 µsec; upper limit 80 mAmp using Anuform anal probe. Patients turned up the stimulation to the maximum voltage which caused no discomfort: 3 seconds on then 3 seconds rest for 20 minutes twice daily at home. The initial session was 30 minutes with a 30 minute follow-up session one week later. Both interventions were carried out two times daily for eight weeks.</P>
<P>Four studies compared different methods of delivering biofeedback (<LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHugh-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McHugh 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>). Heymen randomised patients to one of four groups:<BR/>1. anal EMG biofeedback plus home exercise;<BR/>2. anal EMG biofeedback plus rectal balloon distension sensory training to perceive lower rectal volumes and hold larger rectal volumes;<BR/>3. anal EMG biofeedback plus home exercise using a home biofeedback machine;<BR/>4. anal EMG biofeedback plus rectal balloon distension sensory training plus home exercise using a home biofeedback machine.</P>
<P>Norton (<LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>) randomised patients to one of four groups (all monthly 45 to 60 minute sessions for up to six sessions):<BR/>1. education, advice, urge resistance training, medication titration, diet and fluid adjustment (no biofeedback or exercise);<BR/>2. as 1, plus anal sphincter exercises taught by digital examination and a leaflet, with instruction to practise maximal, submaximal and fast-twitch exercises 10 times daily at home;<BR/>3. as 2. plus computer-assisted anal sphincter pressure biofeedback at each session;<BR/>4. as 3. plus a home anal EMG biofeedback machine for home practice.</P>
<P>Solomon (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>) randomised patients to exercises taught digitally, via anal ultrasound biofeedback or via anal manometry biofeedback (five 30 
minute sessions over four months).</P>
<P>One study compared clinic biofeedback with a home biofeedback device (<LINK REF="STD-McHugh-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McHugh 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The design of the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Latimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Latimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 1990</LINK>), which attempted to evaluate different components of biofeedback therapy, have been described above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Trials included a variety of outcome measures, many of which have not been validated.</P>
<P>Five trials reported patient evaluation of the outcome as a primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naimy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Naimy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eight studies used a patient-completed diary. One study took no episodes of faecal incontinence in a one week diary at the end of treatment as a 'complete response' (<LINK REF="STD-Ilnyckyj-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ilnyckyj 2005</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-11 13:34:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some studies have suggested that there is no difference between different conservative interventions and that adding exercises or biofeedback, or both, does not enhance the outcomes of conservative management (<LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>). However, subsequent studies have used a step-wise protocol, trying the simpler interventions first and then only recruiting those who fail to respond to simpler measures such as diet and education (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2009</LINK>). These later studies have found a difference between exercise alone and exercise with the addition of rectal balloon (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>) or EMG biofeedback (<LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2009</LINK>) in favour of adding biofeedback.</P>
<P>There was not enough evidence to say whether different methods of providing feedback made a difference (<LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2003</LINK>) because the trials were small.</P>
<P>Addition of electrical stimulation to biofeedback and exercises may also enhance results (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2010</LINK>). A single trial in this review suggests that anal biofeedback is superior to vaginal, and that electrical stimulation might enhance the results of exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>). However, the trial focused on the use of electrical stimulation as an adjunct to biofeedback and compared two very different types of interventions (vaginal pelvic floor manometric pressure biofeedback and home exercise with anal EMG biofeedback and home exercises in combination with anal electrical stimulation) and did not single out just the effects of electrical stimulation or biofeedback. Moreover, it is difficult to know how much of this improvement is a consequence of the natural history of faecal incontinence following childbirth as a no-treatment group was not included.</P>
<P>In one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tjandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tjandra 2008</LINK>) showed that sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management which consisted of biofeedback and PFMT.</P>
<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2011</LINK>) showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.65).</P>
<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Heymen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heymen 2009</LINK>) comparing manometric biofeedback and pelvic floor exercises with exercises alone showed a statistically significant result for number of people failing to achieve full continence favouring biofeedback (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94).</P>
<P>It appears also that training to enhance rectal discrimination of sensation may be helpful in reducing faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 1990</LINK>). It may be that adding this technique to the more commonly available pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) would enhance results, but this cannot be a strong recommendation in view of the small numbers and lack of follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Bols-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bols 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:28:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was a wide variation among trial reports in terms of characteristics of participants, characteristics of interventions, choice of outcome measures, duration of treatment and length of follow-up. Most of the trials were small and probably of insufficient power to detect any differences between intervention groups. The outcome measures used were often insufficiently reported to enable further statistical analyses. Length of follow-up was not clearly reported or was inadequate in many of the trials. The way in which data were reported in many of the trials (by not reporting measures of variance) made a quantitative synthesis of results (meta-analysis) impossible.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-08 12:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials are thought to provide sound evidence on the effects of healthcare interventions mainly because they can eliminate selection bias. Methodological weaknesses in some studies included in this review are likely to have compromised this assumption. About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-06-07 14:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It should be noted that pressure and EMG measurements may not be comparable between different studies because of equipment and technique variations. Within-study changes should be more reliable. There are no direct 'objective' measures of faecal incontinence. Changes in anorectal physiology measurements are proxy outcome measures and need not mean changes in the patient's symptoms, which should be seen as the primary end-point.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-11 13:36:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are over 60 uncontrolled trial reports in the literature on the use of biofeedback for the management of faecal incontinence in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2009</LINK>). Some authors maintain that biofeedback is the treatment of choice for faecal incontinence on the basis of the findings of these observational studies. The results of this review show that there is some evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the effectiveness of biofeedback therapy for the management of people with faecal incontinence. All studies reviewed showed improved symptoms in all groups, and some difference between groups are reported in the latest studies in favour of adding biofeedback or electrical stimulation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:33:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no evidence that one method of biofeedback or exercises gives any benefit over any other method, but biofeedback or electrical stimulation may offer an advantage over exercises alone if patients have previously failed to respond to other conservative managements. Addition of biofeedback to surgical sphincter repair does not appear to improve the outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2004</LINK>). On the whole, it is not possible to draw strong conclusions for practice from the data analysed in this review. In particular, there is not enough evidence on which to select patients suitable for anal sphincter exercises or biofeedback, or both; nor to know which modality of biofeedback or exercises is optimal. Reducing the threshold of discrimination of rectal sensation does seem to be clinically useful (<LINK REF="STD-Miner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miner 1990</LINK>). Electrical stimulation or anal biofeedback, or both, may be superior to vaginal biofeedback in women with symptoms after childbirth (<LINK REF="STD-Fynes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fynes 1999</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tjandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tjandra 2008</LINK>) included in this review found sacral nerve stimulation to be superior to exercises. However, based on the available evidence these conclusions can only be tentative. No study reported any adverse events or deterioration in symptoms, and it seems unlikely that these treatments may cause any harm.</P>
<P>Treatment options for faecal incontinence have not yet been investigated by means of well-designed trials. A Cochrane review of surgery for faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>) failed to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of different surgical interventions mainly because of the dearth of controlled clinical trials concerning the most common operations (for example anterior overlapping anal sphincter repair). Another Cochrane review on drug treatments failed to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy of current pharmacological interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 2002</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:35:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes, validated outcome measures and long-term follow-up. In particular, studies should assess the effectiveness of different components of the package of care often called 'biofeedback', including exercises, feedback on sphincter function, rectal sensitivity training and co-ordination training, as well as lifestyle advice that is often given to patients during the course of consultation (e.g. dietary advice, use of medication, bowel habit information). Comparisons of intensive versus less intensive exercise regimens would be useful, as would measurement of compliance with exercises and advice. Little attention seems to have been given to the patient's perspective on outcome in the published studies, and there is no information on what patients view as a good or satisfactory outcome of treatment for faecal incontinence. Economic analyses should also be incorporated into future trials.</P>
<P>There is a need for trials comparing exercises or biofeedback, or both, to other treatments such as medication, dietary manipulation or surgery. In all future studies there is a need to characterise the participants in detail so that judgements can be made on which treatments are of benefit to which diagnostic categories.</P>
