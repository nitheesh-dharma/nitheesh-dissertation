I have run spell check and made some minor copy edits. The natural frequency sentence in the abstract was not quite correct and I have re-written it (see highlighted text). This is not number needed to treat (which is 51 with 95% CI 24 to infinity), it is number suffering an exacerbation for 100 treated with LABA and ICS versus higher dose ICS. I have added a smiley face plot as Figure 5 to make this clearer too.

Final senterce of conclusion in abstract therefore deleted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - did the new studies change the results or conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiating inhaled steroids at a higher dose - what were the high and low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this fixed dose Rx? (Were any SMART studies considered for example?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Synthesis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Studies designed to test equivalence in treatment efficacy require a different analytical approach to that used for trials in which the hypothesis under test is that one treatment has greater efficacy than its comparator. This is because small trials may favour the conclusion that there was no difference between treatments since the confidence intervals for the two treatments will be wide and, therefore, more likely to include the line of no difference between the two treatments. The limits of treatment equivalence were set &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; at +/- 0.10, on either side of the no-difference line for our primary outcome, the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. The null hypothesis tested whether the confidence interval for the difference between the two treatments included one of these limits.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what you are trying to say in this paragraph (but I also see that it was in the review already)? Can we discuss please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of included studies is very useful, interesting to see how much diversity there is between study participants and the actual treatments administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEV1 is tricky for subgroup work; adults and children will be different. For Comparison 2 Cuchalin was 52 weeks and SAM40034 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;In symptomatic steroid-naive asthmatic patients, the combination of long acting &amp;#223;2-agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids &lt;b&gt;has not been shown to significantly&lt;/b&gt; reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids as compared to using a similar dose of ICS alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the above sentence as the data does not rule out a difference, as you rightly point out in the next section!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-02-23 11:28:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-02-23 11:41:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;PS the units of effect measures need checking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-02-23 11:42:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt; on the Forest plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-02-23 11:41:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;.

Could you look at these please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARCHIE IS SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THIS - THE FIELDS THAT ARE OFTEN MISSING RELATE TO CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS WHEN PAGE NUMBERS ARE NOT GIVEN (ONLY ABSTRACT OR POSTER NUMBERS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies ; fine I have added a line to GOAL to clarify that one third of patients were in stratum one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Toby could you change the graph labels so they are all ICS + LABA. the new ones are LABA + ICS. thanks.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis- fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;I have added &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; in a few places and removed the final sentence, (There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend use of combination therapy rather than ICS alone as a first-line treatment. ) We should be reporting the findings of the studies and not recommending how users interpret the results (in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were there really 4486 patients contributing to the anaylsis. I do not see this number in the forest plots? In particular exacerbations are based on very small numbers. How many of the GOAL patients are in this figure - 3k or 1k?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1K - STRATUM 1 DATA ONLY IN THE REVIEW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Very small numbers of patients contribute to the primary outcome. I would suggest adding the GOAL data somewhere as GIV using the P value of 0.009 even though it includes admissions as well. Otherwise the results on 1098 patients are not shown!!!!! Otherwise the results read very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL - The P value relates to annualised rates of exacerbations and NOT those of first phase. I have added this as a caveat to the estimate but not entered the data. GOAL was looking at stepping up ics dose and as such does not styrctly adhere to the design of the review question. I have asked Eric Bateman for the data. I would not hold your breath though even if we do get the numbers it will be a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have altered the PEF subgroup sentence (changes in red): &amp;quot;The change in PEF was significantly greater in patients with lower baseline lung function (FEV1&amp;lt;80%; 28.36 L/min vs FEV1&amp;gt;=80%: 16.69 L/min: group difference=11.7L, p=0.048), however this result could be influenced by regression to the mean.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Please add GOAL data as a combined exacerbation outcome. I also think this needs to be noted in the abstract!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion I have added the following in red: &amp;quot;It should however be noted that the steroid-naive stratum of the GOAL study (including 1098 patients) did demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the combined outcome of exacerbations leading to oral steroids, visit to the emergency department or admission to hospital.&amp;quot; I would regard the primary outcome findings as mixed rather than negative and this paragraph might need fine tuning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL Fine tuned a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed the following &amp;quot;suggesting that the intervention may be less effective than initially estimated.&amp;quot; in relation to the updated change in FEV1 as I suspect both figures are within the original CI????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &amp;quot;How can we reconcile the beneficial effect of the addition of LABA on lung function, symptoms and use of rescue &amp;#223;2-agonists with the apparent absence of protection against exacerbations or withdrawals due to poor asthma control?&amp;quot; I do not agree with the premise of absence of protection so I suggest this is reworded. Put in red but not changed.&lt;br&gt;2.***The differential conclusion of the benefit of combination therapy may very well depend on the choice of outcomes, that is, those directly related to their effect on smooth muscle versus airway inflammation.*** As above&lt;br&gt;3.***In this review, all three trials contributing data to the main outcome delivered combination therapy in two separate inhalers (BUT THE GOAL STUDY DID NOT).*** As above but I do not think you can conclude that GOAL reduced exacerbations because the two drugs were in one inhaler and the the other studies used separate inhalers for a host differences.&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Please respond to comments above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. TJL changed: The lack of evaluable evidence for our primary outcome means that we are unable to assess whether the beneficial effect of the addition of LABA on lung function, symptoms and use of rescue &amp;#223;2-agonists is related to improvements in asthma control as measured by the frequency of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospitalisations. The outcome that is likely to give an approximation of the suucess of these treatments in controlling asthma is withdrawals from the studies due to poor asthma control or exacerbations. Even in this outcome with data from 12 trials, the frequency of this occuring was low, and may contribute to a lack of effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. TJL changed :***The differential conclusion of the benefit of combination therapy may very well depend on the choice of outcomes and/or the availability of data. The benefit of adding a bronchodilator can be demonstrated over short periods of time when measuring lung function outcomes, but may require larger studies of longer duration when the outcome of interest relates to airway inflammation.***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. TJL added line: '...although data from all phases of the GOAL (stratum 1) study did favour a combined preparation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for practice&lt;br&gt;***In symptomatic steroid-naive asthmatics with mild or moderate airway obstruction, there is no evidence that initiating anti-inflammatory therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists leads to greater prevention of exacerbations than inhaled corticosteroids alone.***THIS IS NO LONGER LIKELY WITH GOAL DATA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL changed to: 'In symptomatic steroid-naive asthmatics with mild or moderate airway obstruction, the avialable evidence does not support initiating anti-inflammatory therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists over inhaled corticosteroids alone in order to prevent exacerbations requiring oral steroids. Data from one large trial favoured a combined preparation of these than inhaled corticosteroids alone'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend use of combination therapy rather than ICS as a first line treatment for persistent asthma.&amp;quot; I have removed this (see comment on abstract).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Exacerbations and the GOAL results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: I have changed Beta to greek B throughout for consistency.&lt;br&gt;ACTION:&lt;br&gt;Next action ; back to Toby.&lt;br&gt;===========================================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;85 references (19 studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution: great&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Very clear but I did not understand &amp;quot; number of inhalation&lt;br&gt;devices to deliver combination therapy&amp;quot; - I have altered this to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE DISCUSSED THIS POINT- WHETHER SINGLE/MULTIPLE; SEPARATE/ COMBINATION;&lt;br&gt;ONE/TWO WOULD BE THE CLEAREST WAY OF DESCRIBING THIS AND IN THE DECIDED TO&lt;br&gt;GO WITH ' ONE OR TWO DEVICES TO DELIVER COMBINATION THERAPY&amp;quot;.***fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did you arrive at the definition of steroid naive &amp;quot;who had not received&lt;br&gt;inhaled corticosteroids in the month preceding enrolment.&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol&lt;br&gt;indicates that the patients had to be on ICS for a month before. I&lt;br&gt;understand why this was changed but I think this needs to be explained. I&lt;br&gt;would assume steroid naive to mean never been on ICS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE DEFINED STEROID NA&amp;#207;VE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE META-ANALYSIS AS ONE MONTH&lt;br&gt;OR GREATER- WE FELT THIS WOULD BE AN ADEQUATE WASH OUT PERIOD IF THE&lt;br&gt;PATIENTS HAD BEEN ON PRIOR ICS SO THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY STEROID NAIVE-(&lt;br&gt;THIS IS ALL DOCUMENTED IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF DESCIPTION OF STUDIES)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROTOCOL CLARIFIED TO SAY THAT INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS TO OF MORE THAN ONE&lt;br&gt;MONTH DURATION***/ok but the protocol needs alteration as the part currently in red is not correct (it implies never had inhaled steroids).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We aim to examine whether any observed benefit may be influenced by&lt;br&gt;factors&lt;br&gt;such as severity of baseline airway obstruction, age, dose of inhaled&lt;br&gt;corticosteroids, number of inhalation devices to deliver combination&lt;br&gt;therapy, long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonist preparation, and trial duration.&amp;quot; I am not&lt;br&gt;convinced that it is realistic to expect to carry out such a wide range of&lt;br&gt;sub-group analyses! Should this sentence be moved down to the methods&lt;br&gt;section???&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WERE NOT SURE WE AGREE HERE. WE ARE PLANNING TO UPDATE THE REVIEW WHEN WE&lt;br&gt;OBTAIN THE AWAITED STUDIES.** ok, but I am stil troubled by this because 1. There is only a small effect to look at 2. Multiple comparisons all interfere with each other and are confounded. 3. The more you have the more there is chance of spurious results. Much caution is needed in this and at present the expectations of getting something useful from this are outweighed by the risk of misleading answers (in my view).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;References: Pearlman 1999(1000) has no citation. Please add this. Also the&lt;br&gt;first excluded study has lots of citations but no study ID - please add.&lt;br&gt;Additional refs: ERS 1999 has no authors and Nelson 1995 has no journal&lt;br&gt;details - please add.&lt;br&gt;ALL DONE- THANKS FOR PICKING THIS UP!**great&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most of the studies awaiting assessment can be excluded on the&lt;br&gt;basis&lt;br&gt;that a different ICS is used in the two arms. It would be helpful if this&lt;br&gt;could be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THESE STUDIES AWAITING ASSESSMENT THE SAME DOSE OF ICS IS USED IN THE&lt;br&gt;CONTROL AND INTERVENTION GROUPS** I am very concerned about this. Could you go through the table of included studies and enter the name and dose of ICS in ALL the studies (already there for most of them). I really do not think you can answer this question reliably when there is a DIFFERENT ICS in each arm such as the first included study. This is the only one in the review that I can see at present and I do not think it should be there. Confounding by type of ICS is a threat that is best removed from the review, ESPECIALLY is you wish to carry out the sort of subgroups by baseline severity, ICS dose etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in view of the current hype over the GOAL study could&lt;br&gt;this go in under studies awaiting assessment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH REFERENCES BEING DELETED FROM REVIEW. GOAL ALONG&lt;br&gt;WITH 3 OTHER STUDIES AWAITING ASSESSMENT WERE DELETED BEFORE YOU GOT&lt;br&gt;REVIEW. RE-ENTERED. **fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Excellent. (THANKS!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: I have turned off the totals for single study outcomes and&lt;br&gt;reversed the graph labels for change in symptom score as negative is better&lt;br&gt;for this outcome if high symptom scores are bad (please check this outcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKED AND AGREE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1#11 and 13 and 16). I am not sure if the data for 1#14 should be entered&lt;br&gt;as&lt;br&gt;negative numbers - was this a % reduction in nights with no awakenings?&lt;br&gt;HERE IN % NIGHTS WITH NO AWAKENINGS AN INCREASE IS BETTER SO I LEFT THE&lt;br&gt;DATA LABELS AS THEY WERE FOR THIS ONE.**OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please amend data/title/labels?

The final sentence is too subjective in my view. You could&lt;br&gt;change it to reflect your conclusions as to whether the current evidence is&lt;br&gt;sufficient to overide the present advice (which you may feel it is not!)&lt;br&gt;PLEASE REWRITE THIS.&lt;br&gt;WE REWROTE THIS AS ** fine. I have added a couple of words in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fine. RevMan no longer calculates using MetaView but RevMan&lt;br&gt;Analyses so I have altered this. Di Franco does not seem to have a placebo&lt;br&gt;group so EITHER this study must be removed or you should change the&lt;br&gt;inclusion criteria in objectives that specifies placebo must be used. The&lt;br&gt;protocol does not specify either way as far as I can see.&lt;br&gt;ACTION NEEDED!&lt;br&gt;WELL SPOTED! WE CHANGED TYPES OF STUDIES TO STATE THAT WE ACCEPTED&lt;br&gt;CONTROLLED STUDIES WITH OR WITHOUT PLACEBO** I am happy with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sensible handling of dropouts when they are high and also low inclusion&lt;br&gt;from&lt;br&gt;run-in period in Nelson.&lt;br&gt;NOT SURE WHAT ADJUSTMENT YOU SUGGEST HERE. PERHAPS YOU COULD CLARIFY?**none needed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fine. I have changed to CHI as i am not sure the greek letters&lt;br&gt;publish properly yet.&lt;br&gt;NOTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;The non-superiority of the combination therapy (inhaled&lt;br&gt;corticosteroids and long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists) over inhaled corticosteroids&lt;br&gt;alone is also suggested by similar rate of withdrawals due to poor asthma&lt;br&gt;control.&amp;quot; I do not think this suggests non-superiority in view of the wide&lt;br&gt;confidence interval which exceeds the 0.1 threshold set by your methods.&lt;br&gt;Please withdraw or re-write this! In fact none of the confidence intervals&lt;br&gt;exclude this margin so the conclusion of this review must be that we DO NOT&lt;br&gt;KNOW. Same applies to the sentences in red below in discussion and&lt;br&gt;reviewers&lt;br&gt;conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;At present, it doesn't appear that the severity of airway obstruction at&lt;br&gt;baseline influences the magnitude of effect of combination therapy as&lt;br&gt;compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone for any of the outcome&lt;br&gt;variables.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In symptomatic steroid-naive asthmatics with mild or moderate airway&lt;br&gt;obstruction, there is little evidence that initiating anti-inflammatory&lt;br&gt;therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting&lt;br&gt;&amp;#223;2-agonists leads to superior asthma control than inhaled corticosteroids&lt;br&gt;alone; it is not associated with a reduction in the risk of exacerbations&lt;br&gt;or&lt;br&gt;withdrawals due to poor asthma control.&amp;quot; Confidence interval too wide to&lt;br&gt;rule out this possibility!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE HAVE RE-WORDED THESE SECTIONS ** OK but I have removed the slight trend in disfavour as I regard this as misleading with such a huge confidence interval. The point estimate is completely unreliable. I have also made another small highlight in red (10% of which RCTs do you mean?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues: The Abstracts from J Allergy Clin Immun March 2004&lt;br&gt;include several references to GOAL.

My main worry relates to different ICS in each arm. I would not have accepted a protocol that suggested doing this. Please discuss with FD on her return from hols and get back to me! The conclusions are also heavily influenced by the choice of primary outcome in this review. Why would a clinician wish to start with combined Rx in selected patients?

O&amp;#8217;byrne is final usage NOT change from baseline. This is the biggest trial and should carry most of the weight so we need to get this right. Can you get hold of the change data from the authors? It is not a good idea to combine change and absolute data due to publication bias and for statistical reasons.&lt;br&gt;Also I think you have misclassified Chuchalin as the PEF is lower than Nelson so FEV1 cannot be over 80% predicted. This throws quite a different light on the heterogeneity between subgroups for mild and severe patients and might explain why o&amp;#8217;byrne (milder patients) does not fit with the other data!&lt;br&gt;Please also check the SD for night time Chuchalin scores as it does not accord with the others from Table 2 in that paper.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;FD replied:&lt;br&gt;Dear Muireann,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see my comments in the text below preceded by **.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIDN&amp;#8217;T FIND ANY ** IN THE TEXT OF THE REVIEW.&lt;br&gt;ONLY RED CHANGE IS IN SYNOPSIS IS FINE WITH ME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main worryrelates to different ICS in each arm.

Can you get hold&lt;br&gt;of the change data from the authors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE DID, THE DATA INCLUDED WAS OBTAINED FROM O&amp;#8217;BYRNE AND IS CHANGE FROM BASELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;not a good idea to combine change and absolute data due to publication bias and&lt;br&gt;for statistical reasons.&lt;br&gt;WE DIDN&amp;#8217;T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also I think you have misclassified Chuchalin as the PEF is lower than Nelson so&lt;br&gt;FEV1 cannot be over 80% predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRUE &amp;#8211; WE WILL MOVE CHUCHALIN TO &amp;lt;80^% PREDICTED LIKE NELSON IN EACH OF THE 53&lt;br&gt;OUTCOMES TO WHICH IT APPLIES AND CORRECT ANY VALUES IN THE TEXT IF APPLICABLE&lt;br&gt;WITH CHANGES IN RED. GIVE US A FEW DAYS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This throws quite a different light on the heterogeneity between subgroups for&lt;br&gt;mild and severe patients and might explain why o'byrne (milder patients) does&lt;br&gt;not fit with the other data!&lt;br&gt;YES, BUT THERE IS ONLY HETEROGENEITY IN OUTCOME 16 (CHANGE IN #PUFFS/24 HOURS)&lt;br&gt;ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS MISCLASSIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also check the SD for night time Chuchalin scores as it does not accord&lt;br&gt;with the others from Table 2 in that paper.&lt;br&gt;I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO OUTCOME 13 . THE VALUE PRESENTED IN TABLE 2&lt;br&gt;REPRESENT +/-95 %CI SO we NEED TO DIVIDE THE value BY 1.96 (to get SEM) then&lt;br&gt;multiply by square root of n to get SD;.

This does&lt;br&gt;no affect results&lt;br&gt;reported in text. However, there are now insufficient numbers of studies in&lt;br&gt;each group to examine whether the magnitude of improvement in FEV1 was affected&lt;br&gt;by baseline severity so this is mentioned in results section.&lt;br&gt;2.As regards studies in section 'studies awaiting assessment' we only have&lt;br&gt;kept studies where the dose if ICS is the same in both placebo and LABA treated&lt;br&gt;groups. We did not have different types of ICS as exclusion criteria as long as&lt;br&gt;the dose equivalence was the same in each group. This leaves 10 studies in&lt;br&gt;awaiting assessment. I clarified this in the section 'Criteria for considering&lt;br&gt;studies'&lt;br&gt;3.In relation to numbers of subgroup analyses proposed in methodology. These&lt;br&gt;were proposed a priori analyses. As subgroup analyses, they are given less&lt;br&gt;weight than the overall analyses but may eventually provide useful information&lt;br&gt;to better characterise patient and treatment characteristics that influence the&lt;br&gt;magnitude of response to either treatment. The small number of trials&lt;br&gt;contributing data to each subgroup were insufficient to allow firm conclusion&lt;br&gt;with the currently available evidence. In fact, we were unable to&lt;br&gt;do any subgroup analysis on the primary outcome.&lt;br&gt;4. Correction made to methodology to confirm that steroid na&amp;#239;ve meant never had&lt;br&gt;ICS or had not received ICS in the preceding 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muireann&lt;br&gt;_************************* End of pasted section*************************************______________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;cjc Edit 14/10/2004&lt;br&gt;I am concerned this version did not include the note that I added above ******************, why is this? Are we all using the same version here? Also Francine assured me in her email that the trials all compared the SAME ICS at the same dose in both arms (which I think it the best approach) but Muireann has added text in red to say that it is acceptable to have different ICS at equivalent dose in the two arms. As a result the trials included has gone up to 18 but only 8 (not 9 as stated in the abstract) contribute data.&lt;br&gt;This is messy and needs untangling please. I would strongly advise that we go with Francine's approach and do NOT include studies with different ICS. This means adjusting the included, excluded and studies awaiting assessment to reflect this.&lt;br&gt;Could you do this (checking that we are all using the most up to date version please)&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;HI Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re: final version. I carefully reviewed the version you edited in July 8 which&lt;br&gt;we only received in sept 04.(see next email) there was no additional string of&lt;br&gt;comments in notes in the version we received. However we did received the&lt;br&gt;comments in the text form which we responded as requested. It seems like you&lt;br&gt;didn't add it to the version you sent us or you send the wrong version.&lt;br&gt;however, the modifications in the text seemed to match your questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re: ICS. the protocol accepted by Peter Gibson did not exclude different types&lt;br&gt;of ICS if the dose-equivalent. We therefore did not excluded them. I don't&lt;br&gt;think the type of drug really matters if it is equivalent in dose. If you are&lt;br&gt;really worried, we could do a sensitivity analysis for the next update &amp;#8211;&lt;br&gt;useless here with only 1 trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re: SD. I rechecked all of chuchalin data. The only mistake was in the outcome&lt;br&gt;13 &amp;#8211; SD changed to 0.59 and 0.6 respectively. Since there is only one study in&lt;br&gt;outcome 13, this change has no impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re: synopsis. The sentence was changed &amp;#8220;This review analysed randomised&lt;br&gt;controlled trials in whom children and adults with asthma had little previous&lt;br&gt;exposure, or had not received, inhaled corticosteroids for one month or more.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;This accurately reflects the description of studies, including Chuchalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I removed all other red sections, highlighted in sept to show changes. The only&lt;br&gt;new change(red highlight) is in synopsis. (naiveoct2204)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trust this answers your final questions. do you think it will make it for the&lt;br&gt;nov deadline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;br&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;21 Oct 2004&lt;br&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;br&gt;There is no protocol that I can find on the library so I cannot check what was originally agreed (where is the protocol)? It is my view that by including different steroids in each arm you are confounding the comparison as we do not know exact dose equivalences. For the sake of the one study that does this in the review at present I am not convinced that this is sensible and I am puzzled because you previously responded that you were NOT doing this in an email above in caps. If you are determined to proceed with this it will certainly need to be assessed as a sensitivity analysis in future updates and this should be included in the methods please.&lt;br&gt;The synopsis is ambiguous with the extra bit on &amp;quot;previous little exposure&amp;quot;. The inclusion was no inhaled steroids for a month so this is what the synopsis should say and I have changed this.&lt;br&gt;The main remaining problem is that the links to studies are messed up since someone has added changes as free text in black (some of the (400) for Cuchlain for example and b after Nelson. ( I have put some of these in red but the whole document needs the links checking. This is pretty difficult to make any sense of. Also it would be more consistent to use the dose in all the references to included trials or ONLY the Pearlman study ID as there are two doses in this study.&lt;br&gt;Nelson 2003 b is an ongoing study and O'Byrne 2001 is an excluded study yet these links seem to have been used for included studies. This cannot go forward like this.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for checking the Cuchlain SDs.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Addition of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled steroids as first line therapy for persistent asthma in steroid-naive adults&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Final version received from FD. 21 Oct&lt;br&gt;Toby has done a great job with the study ids and links.&lt;br&gt;Changes to methods (sensitivity sentence) and new names convention agreed and changed back to black text. I have removed Cuchlain from 1#16 where it was in both subgroups by mistake and this leaves all the heterogeneity between Obyrne and the other trials. I have mentioned this in red in the text. Francine I know you already checked the Obyrne SDs but they still look small to me. Also the lower CI is 0.88 not 1.88.&lt;br&gt;This can now go out for Peer Review as soon as Francine clears these alterations..&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;Francine do you want to add your potential conflicts of interest later (as per the last review?)&lt;br&gt;PLEASE MAKE SURE WE ALL WORK FROM THIS VERSION&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Final changes accepted and Toby will send for Peer Review. cjc Oct 22&lt;br&gt;16 Dec 2004&lt;br&gt;Peer Review comments:&lt;br&gt;1.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:39:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In patients with asthma who require daily anti-inflammatory therapy, there is insufficient evidence to support initiating therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting ß2-agonist (LABA) rather than with inhaled corticosteroids alone. Most consensus statements recommend the addition of LABA as second line therapy, only in asthmatic individuals who remain insufficiently controlled on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids. Yet, many physicians initiate combination therapy in patients with asthma, without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids alone. The purpose of this review was to compare the benefit and safety profile of initiating treatment with the combination of ICS and LABA as compared to a (1) similar and (2) higher dose of ICS alone in asthmatic patients who had not received ICS previously. This review identified 28 randomised controlled trials. The combination of ICS and LABA did not reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids but improved lung function, symptoms and minimally reduced the use of rescue ß2-agonists as compared to a similar dose of ICS alone. Initiating ICS at a higher dose than that used with LABA in the control group significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations and study withdrawals over that observed with the combination of LABA and a lower dose of ICS; there is insufficient evidence to comment on the impact on lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß2-agonists. The current evidence does not support use of combination therapy with LABA and ICS as first line treatment in adults and children with asthma, without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>

<P>Each author assessed studies independently for risk of bias and extracted data. We obtained confirmation from the trialists when possible.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-06-25 09:07:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Twenty-eight study comparisons drawn from 27 trials (22 adult; five paediatric) met the review entry criteria (8050 participants). Baseline data from the studies indicated that trial populations had moderate or mild airway obstruction (FEV1&#8805;65% predicted), and that they were symptomatic prior to randomisation. In comparison 1, the combination of ICS and LABA was not associated with a significantly lower risk of patients with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.47) or requiring hospital admissions (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.65) compared to a similar dose of ICS alone. The combination of LABA and ICS led to a significantly greater improvement from baseline in FEV1<SUB> </SUB>(0.12 L/sec; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.17), in symptoms (SMD -0.26; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14) and in rescue ß2-agonist use (-0.41 puffs/day; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.09) compared with a similar dose of ICS alone. There was no significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.09), any adverse events (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09), study withdrawals (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11), or withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.41).</P>
<P>In comparison 2, the combination of LABA and ICS was associated with a higher risk of patients requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1 to 1.53) and study withdrawal (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59) than a higher dose of ICS alone. For every 100 patients treated over 43 weeks, nine patients using a higher dose ICS compared to 11 (95% CI 9 to 14) on LABA and ICS suffered one or more exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids. There was a high level of statistical heterogeneity for FEV1 and morning peak flow. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events. Due to insufficient data we could not aggregate results for hospital admission, symptoms and other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In steroid-naive patients with mild to moderate airway obstruction, the combination of ICS and LABA does not significantly reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over that achieved with a similar dose of ICS alone. However, it significantly improves lung function, reduces symptoms and marginally decreases rescue ß2-agonist use. Initiation of a higher dose of ICS is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids, and of withdrawals, than combination therapy. Although children appeared to respond similarly to adults, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding combination therapy in steroid-naive children, given the small number of children contributing data.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The cornerstone of asthma management is the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to alleviate the inflammatory reaction that characterises asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008b</LINK>). Short-acting ß2-agonists are the primary agents in the management of acute asthma symptoms. This class of medication provides rapid onset bronchodilation by interaction with specific ß2-adrenergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2003</LINK>). Long-acting ß2-agonists (LABA), such as formoterol and salmeterol, were initially used in persistent asthmatics with severe nocturnal symptoms. Because of their lipophilicity, these agents achieve sustained bronchodilation for up to 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>). Since bronchodilation with these agents is long-lasting, they are of potential use in managing the symptoms of asthma.</P>
<P>The use of salmeterol in combination with inhaled corticosteroids has been found to be superior to an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroids for improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Shrewsbury-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrewsbury 2000</LINK>). However, a subsequent larger systematic review found an absence of a statistically significant group difference in the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, while significantly greater improvements in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß2-agonists were documented with combination therapy than with higher ICS dose. Interestingly, a subgroup analysis suggested the superiority of a higher dose of ICS over combination therapy in patients with prolonged (&gt; six months) therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). However, monotherapy with long-acting ß2-agonists alone had been associated with significant adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current national and international guidelines for asthma recommend long-acting ß2-agonists as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in patients who are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids alone (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>). More specifically, guidelines recommend the initiation of therapy with low or moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids alone in patients with mild or moderate persistent asthma, respectively. The addition of long-acting ß2-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids is generally recommended once a trial of inhaled corticosteroids alone has been insufficient to achieve adequate asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>). In fact, some national consensus statements have formally advised against the use of long-acting ß2-agonists without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite current guideline recommendations, data from observational studies indicate that the introduction of a long-acting ß2-agonist in mild asthma is still common in adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Sazonov_x002d_Kocevar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazonov-Kocevar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockl 2008</LINK>). Perhaps because of the perception of greater efficacy of combination therapy, there is an increasing tendency for practitioners to initiate a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting ß2-agonists in patients with mild or moderate airway obstruction, without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids alone. The recent development of single inhalers delivering both an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting ß2-agonist may have further facilitated this practice.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The objective of this review was to examine the safety and efficacy of initiating a combination of long-acting ß2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids compared to a similar dose or a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids alone, in steroid-naive children and adults with persistent asthma.</P>
<P>More specifically, we wished to compare the impact of both treatment options on asthma control measured as exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (main outcome), asthma symptoms, lung function, quality of life, withdrawals from the study, inflammatory mediator levels and adverse health events. We aimed to examine whether any observed benefit may be influenced by factors such as severity of baseline airway obstruction, age, dose of inhaled corticosteroids, use of one or two devices to deliver combination therapy, the long-acting ß2-agonist preparation used and trial duration.</P>

<P>Most trials reported changes in lung function, albeit using various parameters, use of rescue ß2-agonists, cause-specific and all-cause withdrawals and overall adverse health events. Improvement in symptoms was reported in different ways (symptom score, percent symptom-free days, percent days with symptoms, percent night awakenings) using many parameters (average value, final value at endpoint, percent change, change in percent values) so aggregation could only be done on a few variables. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grutters-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Grutters 1999</LINK>) reported the impact of treatment on inflammatory markers, serum eosinophils, eosinophilic cationic protein, platelet-activating factor and total IgE.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In symptomatic steroid-naive asthmatic patients, the combination of long acting ß2-agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids does not significantly reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids as compared to using a similar dose of ICS alone; however combination therapy improves lung function, symptoms and, marginally, the use of rescue ß2-agonists. Of the few specific adverse events recorded in the trials, significant group differences were only documented for tremor, which was more than four-fold more frequent with combination therapy than with ICS alone. Initiation of ICS at a slightly higher dose (by 200 to 300 mcg/day) was more effective than the combination of LABA and ICS at a lower dose reducing by 25% the risk of patients experiencing exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids and study withdrawals. Combination therapy achieved a higher evening PEF than a higher dose ICS, with no significant difference in improvement from baseline in FEV1 or morning PEF. Given the small number of children contributing data, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding combination therapy in steroid-naive children although no age group differences are apparent.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 1: LABA + ICS versus same dose ICS</HEADING>
<P>When comparing ICS alone with the combination of LABA with a similar dose of ICS, the available data did not show a statistically significant group difference between these strategies for the main outcome, namely patients with one or more exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids; however, the confidence interval exceeds our predefined limits of equivalence and thus we could not exclude clinically meaningful superiority of either strategy. Subgroup analyses did not detect differences in the magnitude of effect associated with the severity of baseline airway obstruction, the choice of LABA, the dose of ICS, or the duration of treatment. Our findings contrast with that of the steroid-naive stratum of <LINK REF="STD-GOAL" TYPE="STUDY">GOAL</LINK> (1098 patients). The GOAL data could not be included in this review because of the inability to obtain data pertaining only to rescue oral steroids. Using a composite definition of exacerbations including hospital admission, emergency visits and oral steroid, the GOAL study identified a small, but significant reduction in the<I> overall rate</I> of exacerbations over the 12 months, favouring combination therapy (P &lt; 0.009). In contrast to included trials, the GOAL study design included step-up therapy with inhaled corticosteroid until asthma control was achieved, whereas we examined the effects of introducing LABA to a stable dose of ICS. Thus, in addition to the different study design, the definition of exacerbations also differed to our endpoint, which may explain the apparent discrepancy.</P>
<P>In this review, there was no group difference in the risk of hospital admission, but the rarity of the event with only four contributing trials prevents firm conclusion. In contrast, the combination of LABA and ICS was associated with a significantly greater improvement from baseline in lung function, by a magnitude of 0.12 L in FEV1 and 19.5 L/min in morning PEF as compared to those treated with a similar dose of ICS alone. Following the addition of five new studies contributing data to the change in FEV1, the magnitude of improvement in FEV1 due to combination therapy decreased from 210 mL in the original review, to 120 mL in this updated review. While this downward trend probably results from a more representative sample of the population and treatment protocols in which combination therapy can be used, the magnitude of improvement in FEV1 appeared to be significantly affected by trial duration, with data from 24-week or longer studies showing a smaller effect than those reporting outcome data at 12 weeks or less, suggesting that the benefit of combination therapy on lung function appears to wane with time. Because of the lack of power, the effect of the choice of LABA (i.e. formoterol versus salmeterol), and the number of devices to deliver combination therapy, on the improvement in FEV1 could not be examined.</P>
<P>Use of LABA and ICS also translated into significant improvements in the percentage of days without symptoms and in symptom scores over those observed with a similar ICS dose. It was also associated with a modest reduction of rescue fast-acting ß2-agonists (by less than a half-puff per day) compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone. With only one trial reporting data, the impact on airway inflammation could not be examined.</P>
<P>The risk of overall adverse events showed no group difference, meeting our a priori definition of equivalence. With the exception of tremor, which was almost five times more frequent in the combination therapy, there was also no group difference in specific adverse effects. Use of ICS and LABA therapy was not associated with a reduced risk of withdrawals due to either adverse effects or all reasons combined. However, due to the small number of trials, the absence of group difference did not meet our a priori definition of equivalence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison 2: LABA + ICS versus higher dose ICS</HEADING>
<P>When comparing the combination of LABA and ICS to a higher (two-fold) dose of ICS, there is a statistically significant difference in favour of higher doses of ICS in reducing the risk of children and adults with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. The findings were not particularly robust since only three additional trials with no group difference could change the conclusion. This finding is based on three (two adult and one paediatric) trials which all tested salmeterol in patients with a mean baseline FEV1 of 80% of predicted or higher. Whether the findings would be more or less positive in patients with more severe airway obstruction at baseline, receiving a higher ICS dose, or with other characteristics remains to be determined. The findings were supported by the superiority of a higher ICS dose for preventing study withdrawals.</P>
<P>With only four trials contributing few events, no firm conclusion could be made regarding the superiority of either treatment option for reducing the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring hospital admission. There was no significant group difference in most lung function tests, which displayed significant heterogeneity between studies in FEV1 and morning PEF; only the change from baseline in evening PEF favoured combination therapy in two trials with patients with mild airway obstruction. No data could be aggregated for other secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Again, the risk of adverse events was not significantly different between groups, with insufficient power to prove equivalence and to rule out rare serious adverse health events. Due to the small number of trials leading to large confidence intervals, no equivalence in the safety profile can be assumed. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of the impact of a higher dose of corticosteroid requires the documentation of relevant outcomes such as bone mineral density, adrenal function and, in children, growth in studies of long duration (&#8805; 26 to 52 weeks).</P>
<P>The non-superiority of LABA and ICS patients over ICS alone in steroid-naive patients is interesting in view of three previous large Cochrane Reviews. Indeed, as compared to ICS alone, the combination of LABA and ICS was clearly associated with a greater reduction in exacerbations in patients already on daily inhaled corticosteroids and who remained poorly controlled, in other words, when combination therapy was added at step 3 of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>). Moreover, the superiority of a higher ICS dose over the combination of LABA and ICS in steroid-naive patients is intriguing as no group difference was found when these strategies were compared in a large Cochrane Review focusing on patients at step 3 (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK>, which summarised the evidence derived only from GlaxoSmithKline studies involving both steroid-naive and non steroid-naive patients, reported a significant reduction in the odds of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in favour of adding LABA. Our linked Cochrane Reviews would indicate that the impact of LABA needs to be assessed separately in these different populations. Indeed, the divergence in response to LABA between steroid-naive patients and patients who remain poorly controlled while on ICS, exemplifies the heterogeneity in asthma sub-populations and reinforces the need for careful evaluation of all treatment strategies at each GINA step as well as within different subgroups.</P>
<P>The divergence in response for patients at step 2 versus step 3 suggests that, in steroid-naive patients, asthma control is achieved in the majority of patients with ICS alone. This assumption is supported by the negligible reduction in the need for rescue ß2-agonists with LABA (&lt; 1/2 puff/day) despite baseline ß2-agonist use varying between 1 puff/day (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2001</LINK>) and 2.5 to 4 puffs/day (<LINK REF="STD-Chuchalin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chuchalin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1999b</LINK>), thus leaving room for improvement. These observations confirm that the single most important intervention in steroid-naive patients, irrespective of severity of asthma, is to initiate inhaled corticosteroids at low or moderate doses.</P>
<P>Within each protocol, we were unable to demonstrate the impact of varying dose of ICS, LABA and duration of treatment on the magnitude of effects for our primary outcome. This may be explained by the small number of trials which under-powered the subgroup analyses, as well as by the relatively flat dose response of ICS. Indeed, the flat dose-response with inhaled corticosteroids indicates that the major part of the beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids is conferred at a low ICS dose, with minimal additional gain at higher doses (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>). Additional large trials with varying start-up doses of ICS are needed to clarify the relative efficacy of both treatment options and to characterise responders on age, severity of airway obstruction, smoking status etc.</P>
<P>Many proponents of initial treatment with combination therapy may argue that the rapid improvement in lung function, symptom control and reduction in ß2-agonists will lead to better compliance with treatment because of the patient's perception of immediate benefit with LABA. The validity of this argument could not be examined because compliance with treatment was infrequently reported and not apparently analysed in the trials. If compliance was indeed superior with the combination of ICS and LABA, it did not translate into a significant reductions in the risk of asthma exacerbation or a meaningful reduction use of rescue ß2-agonists, whether compared to the same or a higher dose of ICS.</P>
<P>The results of this review must be interpreted in light of the following strengths and limitations. Our review included studies examining the relative efficacy of three different strategies in asthma management for patients with no prior controller medication; that is at step 2 of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. Unfortunately, a notable number of trials did not contribute to our primary outcome, because data on exacerbations treated with systemic steroids was not made available to us. However, we obtained a considerable amount of unpublished information directly from trialists and study sponsors that would not have been otherwise available. With regards to generalisability of study results, only one study reported the proportion of eligible patients amongst those approached and, in the two trials reporting the proportion of randomised patients among those enrolled in the run-in, this varied from 54% (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2003</LINK>) to 99% (<LINK REF="STD-Chuchalin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chuchalin 2002</LINK>). In view of this poor reporting, it is impossible to comment on how far the observed results may be replicated in clinical practice. However one must take note that patients included in the included trials were symptomatic and demonstrated significant (&gt;= 12%) reversibility in FEV1 with a short-acting ß2 agonist. The reversibility to bronchodilator would tend to favour combination therapy with LABA over inhaled corticosteroids alone and may seriously limit generalisability since reversibility to bronchodilator is a criterion met in less than 10% of patients at a given point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Storms-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2003</LINK>), leading to regression towards the mean. We recognise that over-representation of short trials (&lt;= 12 weeks) in the first comparison and the small number of trials in the second comparison may have limited the ability to identify group differences in specific adverse health events. Moreover, the review was not sufficiently powered to examine rare serious adverse health events. The long duration (&gt;= 48 weeks) of two of the three trials contributing data to the main outcome probably explain the precision achieved for the second comparison. Paediatric trials represented 22% of identified studies, yet only one study in each comparison contributed data to the main outcome, thus preventing any subgroup analyses on age. While children seem to respond similarly to adults, no firm conclusion could be made with respect to the relative effectiveness of both treatment options in youth. The conclusion should not be generalised to preschool-aged children, who were not included in any identified trial.</P>

<P>In steroid-naive asthmatic patients who are symptomatic and exhibit mild or moderate airway obstruction, the risk in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids is similar between adding long-acting ß2-agonists (LABA) to inhaled steroids (ICS) and ICS alone. It does not provide sufficient justification for initiating a combination of ICS and LABA without a prior trial of ICS as a means of reducing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids. However, greater improvement in lung function and symptoms, and minimal reduction in use of rescue ß2-agonist would be expected with combination therapy. Interestingly, the benefits observed in lung function appear to wane by 24 weeks. Moreover, the use of higher dose ICS is superior to initiating combination therapy for preventing exacerbations and study withdrawals. The analyses are insufficiently powered to identify characteristics of patients (such as age group) or treatment modalities that may or may not modify the magnitude of effect on the risk of rescue corticosteroids. Insufficient reporting of relevant outcomes and insufficient power preclude firm conclusions as to the relative safety profile of both treatment strategies, including rare serious adverse health events.</P>

<P>Long-term studies &gt;= 24 to 52 weeks are needed to examine the relative safety profile of both treatment options and the characteristics of patients responders (age, gender, smoking status, airway obstruction) or treatment modalities (dose of ICS, number of inhalers, duration of treatment) associated with each treatment strategy (ICS versus the combination of LABA and ICS) as step 2 therapy in steroid naive patients. The safety profile, including serious adverse health events, adrenal function, bone mineralization and, in children, growth, are crucial. Trials in children are of a high priority, with 12-month duration to assess growth. These studies need to be adequately powered and preferably randomised by subgroups with subgroup analyses to identify factors which may modify outcomes (effect modifiers).</P>

<LI>Careful monitoring and reporting of compliance to treatment.</LI>
<LI>Complete reporting of continuous (denominators, mean change and mean standard deviation of change) and dichotomous (denominators and rate) data.</LI>
<LI>Systematic documentation of reasons for withdrawals and adverse effects, including those associated with inhaled corticosteroids, such as oral candidiasis, osteopenia, adrenal suppression and growth suppression.</LI>
<LI>Reporting of cost effectiveness of the use of combination inhalers as compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone.</LI>

<CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Muireann Ni Chroinin, under the supervision of Francine Ducharme, identified and reviewed the full-text publication of all citations of potential or potentially eligible RCTs identified in the 2004 literature search, extracted the methodology and data, analysed and interpreted results of the meta-analysis and wrote the review. Ilana Greenstone participated in the selection of trials from the literature search. Toby Lasserson assessed studies for eligibility from the 2008 literature and company website search update, extracted and entered data, and wrote up the results.</P>
<P>Francine Ducharme supervised Muireann Ni Chroinin, Ilana Greenstone and Toby Lasserson. She conceived the protocol, supervised the literature search, participated in the selection of trials, methodology assessment and data extraction, corresponded with authors and/or the pharmaceutical companies to identify other possibly relevant trials, verify methodology and data extraction and request additional information, analysed and interpreted results of the meta-analysis and supervised the writing up of the review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2009-06-19 13:51:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review has now been amended to include to two treatment comparisons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the addition of LABA to ICS versus the same dose of ICS;</LI>
<LI>the addition of LABA to ICS versus a higher dose of ICS.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We have continued to require that the participants be steroid-naive prior to study entry.</P>
<P>We have incorporated a new method to assess the risk of bias, and based sensitivity analyses on sources of bias relating to blinding and completeness of follow up. Jadad scores have still been calculated for each study, but these findings are not the primary source of assessing the credibility of the results for each study.</P>

<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies has been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (cross-over, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and are restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
