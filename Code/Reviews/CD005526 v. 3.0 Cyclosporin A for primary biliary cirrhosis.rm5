<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Cyclosporin A was without significant effects on mortality, liver transplantation, or progression of primary biliary cirrhosis, and patients given cyclosporin A experienced more adverse events</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by destruction of bile ducts. Estimates of annual incidence range from 2 to 24 people per million population, and estimates of prevalence range from 19 to 240 people per million population. PBC primarily affects middle-aged women. The forecast for the symptomatic patient after diagnosis is between 10 and 15 years. The cause of PBC is unknown, but the dynamics of the disease resemble the group 'autoimmune disease'. Therefore, one might expect a noticeable effect of administering an immune repressing drug (immunosuppressant). This review evaluates all clinical data on the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A for PBC.</P>
<P>The findings in this review are based on three clinical trials with 390 patients. The drug cyclosporin A was tested against placebo. The primary findings of the review are that cyclosporin A has no effect on survival or progression of the disease (cirrhosis development). Patients given cyclosporin A experienced more adverse events than patients given placebo, especially renal dysfunction and hypertension. There was significant improvement in itching (pruritus) and liver biochemistry, which were secondary outcome measures. </P>
<P>We cannot recommend the use of cyclosporin A outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cyclosporin A has been used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but the therapeutic responses in randomised clinical trials have been heterogeneous.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of cyclosporin A for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant randomised clinical trials were identified by searching <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register,</I> the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) </I>in <I>The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, The Chinese Biomedical Database, </I>and <I>LILACS</I>, and manual searches of bibliographies to June 2006. We contacted authors of trials and the company producing cyclosporin A.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing cyclosporin A with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, and publication status. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Our primary outcomes were mortality, and mortality or liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and if appropriate, Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). We examined intervention effects by random-effects and fixed-effect models. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified three trials with 390 patients that compared cyclosporin A versus placebo. Two of them were assessed methodologically adequate with low-bias risk. Cyclosporin A did not significantly reduce mortality risk (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.45), and mortality or liver transplantation (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.20). Cyclosporin A significantly improved pruritus (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.14), but not fatigue. Cyclosporin A significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (WMD -41 U/L, 95% CI -63 to -18) and increased serum albumin level (WMD 1.66 g/L, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.05). Significantly more patients experienced adverse events in the cyclosporin A group than in the placebo group, especially renal dysfunction (Peto odds ratio 5.56, 95% CI 2.52 to 12.27) and hypertension (SMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no evidence supporting or refuting that cyclosporin A may delay death, death or liver transplantation, or progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. Cyclosporin A caused more adverse events than placebo, like renal dysfunction and hypertension. We do not recommend the use of cyclosporin A outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology. Ninety per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are females and the majority are diagnosed after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-James-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1981</LINK>). Over the past 30 years, substantial increases in the prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis has been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is now a frequent cause of liver morbidity, and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are significant users of health resources, including liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is diagnosed on the basis of the triad: antimitochondrial antibodies, found in over 95% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fregeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fregeau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacerda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacerda 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Invernizzi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Invernizzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turchany-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turchany 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattalia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattalia 1998</LINK>); abnormal liver function tests that are typically cholestatic (with raised activity of alkaline phosphatases being the most frequently seen abnormality); and characteristic liver histological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>) in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have been subjected to many drugs. Ursodeoxycholic acid (a bile acid) is the most extensively used drug in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). Other drugs have been immunomodulatory and other agents, such as colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005b</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>; Prince 2005), chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1986</LINK>), azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heathcote 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1985</LINK>), D-penicillamine (<LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>), methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005a</LINK>), or cyclosporin A (<LINK REF="STD-Minuk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Minuk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cyclosporin A has proved effective in preventing immune-mediated rejection of a variety of transplanted human allografts (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1984</LINK>) and has been shown to produce clinical improvement in a number of autoimmune conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 1990</LINK>). Cyclosporin A is a cyclic endecapeptide of fungal origin. It alters lymphokine production so that the T-helper-inducer subpopulations are attenuated, T-cell help required for B-cell activation is blocked, cytotoxic T-cell generation is attenuated, and T-suppressor cell subpopulations are expanded (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1987</LINK>). Thus, cyclosporin A would appear a potential ideal agent to modify the immunologic irregularities in primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-James-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1983</LINK>). Since 1980, when Routhier showed beneficial effects of cyclosporin A on serum aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatases in six patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Routhier-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Routhier 1980</LINK>), several randomised clinical trials have been carried out with different results (<LINK REF="STD-Minuk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Minuk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>). We could not identify any meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the beneficial and harmful effects of cyclosporin A in primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:39:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We identified relevant randomised clinical trials by searching <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, </I>which involves hand searches of major hepatology journals and conference proceedings, the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE,</I> <I>EMBASE</I>, <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I>,<I> The Chinese Biomedical Database</I>, and <I>LILACS</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>). The search strategies are given in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> with the time span of the searches.</P>
<P>We tried to identify further trials by reading the reference lists of the identified publications. We wrote to the principal authors of the identified trials and to the researchers active in the field to inquire about additional randomised clinical trials they might know of. We also contacted the pharmaceutical company, Novartis, producer of cyclosporin A, to obtain any unidentified or unpublished randomised clinical trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">

We wrote to the authors of the included trials and asked them to specify the data of interest, if they had not been reported clearly in the publications.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included trials<BR/>
</B>We assessed the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials using four components (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).

<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>We used the statistical package RevMan Analyses 1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. We presented dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Peto odds ratio (OR) was used to combine rare event data (less than 5%). We presented continuous outcome measures by weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. We used standardised mean differences (SMD) to combine dichotomous data and continuous data on pruritus, fatigue, and blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We examined intervention effects by using both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>) with the significant level set at P &lt; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses concurred, we presented only the results of the fixed-effect model. In case of discrepancies of the two models, we reported the results of both models. We explored the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10 and measured the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Due to small number of trials included, we did not perform subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and statistical tests to explore publication bias and other biases, which were planned in the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005c</LINK>).</P>

<P>We identified a total of 269 references through electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (n = 61), the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> (<I>CENTRAL</I>) in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(n = 54), <I>MEDLINE</I> (n = 31), <I>EMBASE</I> (n = 45), <I>Science Citation Index Expanded </I>(n = 35), <I>The Chinese Biomedical CD Database</I> (n = 43), and<I> LILACS</I> (n = 0). We excluded 254 duplicates and clearly irrelevant references by reading abstracts. Accordingly, 15 references were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, we excluded nine because they were non-randomised clinical studies or observational studies. The remaining six references referred to three randomised clinical trials involving 390 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The publication year of the trials ranged from year 1988 to 1993. All trials were published as full papers. </P>
<P>All the trials compared cyclosporin A versus placebo. The formulation included was the original one, not microemulsion and topical emulsion. The mean age of the patients was about 52 years. The majority of the patients were women (women/men: 338/52). Slightly more patients had stage III or IV than stage I or II (178/154). The dose of cyclosporin A was 2.5, 3, or 4 mg/kg/day. The duration of treatment and follow-up varied from one to three years (See 'Characteristics of included studies'). </P>

<P>
<B>Mortality<BR/>
</B>Three trials with 390 patients provided data to estimate the risk of mortality of cyclosporin A versus placebo (Comparison 01-01). Compared with placebo, cyclosporine A did not significantly affect mortality (15% versus 17%). The relative risk was 0.92 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.45).</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality or liver transplantation<BR/>
</B>Compared with placebo, cyclosporine A did not significantly affect mortality or liver transplantation (22% versus 27%) (Comparison 01-02). The relative risk of mortality or liver transplantation was 0.85 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.20).</P>
<P>
<B>Pruritus, fatigue, and liver complications<BR/>
</B>Cyclosporin A significantly improved pruritus (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.14), but did not significantly have an affect on fatigue (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.46). We were not able to locate data on liver complications because of poor reporting.</P>
<P>
<B>Liver biochemical and histological outcomes<BR/>
</B>Regarding liver biochemistry (Comparison 01-105 to 01-10), cyclosporin A appeared to decrease the levels of s-bilirubin, s-alanine aminotransferase, and s-alkaline phosphatases except for the levels of immunoglobulin M. Cyclosporin A also increased s-albumin compared to the placebo group. Lombard et al used log transformed data on serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases, and aminotransferase for comparisons which prevented us from combining the data from all the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>). Wiesner et al reported data on liver biopsy: histologic progression to at least one more stage and increased or unaltered portal inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>). There was no significant difference between cyclosporin A and placebo (Comparison 01-10).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events<BR/>
</B>In the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>), 34 out of 176 patients given cyclosporin A had adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of the treatment versus 18 out of 173 patient given placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.16). All the three trials reported on other adverse events not necessitating permanent discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.73). The risks of such adverse events were significantly increased in the cyclosporin A treated patients. Among the adverse events, cyclosporin A significantly increased the risk of renal dysfunction (Peto OR 5.56, 95% CI 2.52 to 12.27). Cyclosporine significantly increased the blood pressure (SMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48) as defined by a rise in the diastolic pressure above 5 mmHg since the previous visit (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>) or an increase of &#8805; 25 mmHg in the systolic pressure or &#8805; 12 mmHg in the diastolic pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:40:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Cyclosporin A did not significantly influence the risk of mortality or liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, nor did it delay liver histological progression. Cyclosporin A seemed to ameliorate the patients' pruritus, but not fatigue. Cyclosporin A appeared to decrease the concentration of serum bilirubin and the activities of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatases. Patients given cyclosporin A experienced significantly more adverse events, especially renal dysfunction and hypertension.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, only three trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of cyclosporin A for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Therefore, this systematic review has a major limitation: the small number of trials included (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, all the trials had shorter follow-up than the estimated median survival of primary biliary cirrhosis, ie, 10 years to 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>). Therefore, it is difficult to detect a significant difference on mortality or liver transplantation.</P>
<P>Patients given cyclosporin A had not significantly lower risk of death and liver transplantation. Since two of the trials had a short trial duration (<LINK REF="STD-Minuk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Minuk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>), few patients died during the period. In the largest trial by Lombard et al, patients were treated and followed up to six years. A total of 30 patients in the cyclosporin A group died and an additional 14 patients required liver transplantation, compared with 31 deaths and 15 transplants in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>). When we combined the data, we found no significant difference on deaths and/or liver transplantations between the two groups. The heterogeneity was moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 41.4%) in spite of the disparity on trial duration. Lombard et al found a survival benefit (including death or liver transplantation) only after adjustment for a seemly imbalance in pretreatment variables (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>). However, they did not find the same beneficial effect when adjustment was not applied (logrank P = 0.63). Furthermore, they did not confirm a beneficial effect in reducing the risk of death only - neither without nor with the adjustment (logrank P = 0.87; Cox model P = 0.14). Therefore, we are not convinced of a beneficial effect of cyclosporin A on patients' survival and liver transplantation.</P>
<P>It seems that cyclosporin A improved the symptom of pruritus, which is one of the major complaints of the disease. But this finding should be interpreted with great caution. First of all, the pooling method here is based on an assumption that the underlying distribution of the pruritus score in each treatment group follows a logistic distribution, which might not be the case. Secondly, since pruritus is a subjective assessment, depending on patient's threshold and physician's experience, the potential improvement caused by cyclosporin A needs to be further investigated. We cannot exclude that blinding might have been broken in the trials because of, eg, occurrence of adverse events. This actually happened in the <LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK> trial. Such unblinding might have biased the assessment of pruritus (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cyclosporin A seems to have beneficial effect in reducing the activity of alanine aminotransferase and in increasing serum albumin level. The variety of reporting did not allow us to integrate the data on serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatases, which were found to be improved in <LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK> trials. None of the three trials have found that cyclosporin A delayed the histological progression (including the assessment of inflammation or fibrosis).</P>
<P>Our review shows a benefit from treatment with cyclosporin A on pruritus and liver biochemistry and poses the question as to whether the shown benefits statistically outweigh the adverse events. Lombard et al reported that more patients in the cyclosporin A group experienced adverse events warranting discontinuation and that the proportion of patients with discontinuation was significantly higher than in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>). Most of the adverse events were renal impairment, hypertension, and infective episodes. All the three trials reported adverse events not necessitating permanent discontinuation of treatment. Patients given cyclosporin A experienced significantly more adverse events with the majority being hirsutism, increased blood pressure, and a slight increase in viral or bacterial infection occurrence.</P>
<P>For cyclosporin A, nephrotoxicity and hypertension are adverse events of major concerns. We have, therefore, also extracted the data on these adverse events. Our analyses show that significantly more patients given cyclosporin A had renal dysfunction as defined by creatinine persistently above 141 µmol/L (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lombard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lombard 1993</LINK>). In a majority of the patients, reducing the dose or discontinuing cyclosporin A temporarily was associated with the resolution of the adverse events. On the other hand, no dynamic renal function tests were undertaken in the trials, and it must be conceded that serum creatinine elevation probably underestimates the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Our result demonstrates that cyclosporin A treated patients significantly increased blood pressure. In general, hypertension was easily controlled with medical therapy when indicated (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesner 1990</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite improvements in pruritus and liver biochemical variables, cyclosporin A did not delay the progression to death or liver transplantation, or to an advanced histological stage. In addition, patients given cyclosporin A experienced more adverse events, especially renal dysfunction and hypertension. We do not recommend the use of cyclosporin A outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised clinical trials need to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of cyclosporin A on progression of the disease, need for liver transplantation, and survival. The potential benefits in pruritus and liver biochemistry also need to be further investigated. Future trials need to be closely monitored because of the adverse events, especially renal dysfunction and hypertension. Future trials ought to be reported according to the recommendations of the CONSORT Group (http://www.consort-statement.org/).</P>
