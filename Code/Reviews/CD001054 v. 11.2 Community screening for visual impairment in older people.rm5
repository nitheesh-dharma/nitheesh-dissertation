Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 10 studies.</P><P><B>Key message</B><BR/>There is no evidence that community screening for visual impairment in older people reduces the level of visual impairment in people living independently in the community. Further research on the barriers to accessing care at older ages is needed, as well as research investigating the effect of vision screening on more dependent populations of older people.</P><P><B>What was studied in the review?</B><BR/>Vision problems are common in older people and are associated with an increased chance of falls and lower quality of life. Many older people have undiagnosed vision problems and therefore do not receive appropriate treatment. Community vision screening of older people could lead to improvements in vision by helping to find people with vision problems and putting them in contact with appropriate health care services that can provide treatment for the vision problem. The screening may consist of simple questions about vision (self-reported vision problems) or an eye test involving reading letters on a chart.</P><P>Cochrane Review authors wanted to find out if vision screening results in an improvement in vision in people over 65 years old.</P><P><B>What are the main results of the review?</B><BR/>Cochrane Review authors found 10 relevant studies. Four studies were from the United Kingdom, two studies from Australia, two from the United States and two from the Netherlands. These studies compared vision screening with no vision screening in people of 65 years of age or older. People taking part in these studies were followed up for between one and five years. All studies were funded by government agencies.</P><P>The review shows that:</P><P>&#8226; communities that had vision screening did not have improved vision, on average, compared with communities who did not receive vision screening;<BR/>&#8226; it did not make a difference if vision problems were self-reported or identified by a vision test (reading letters on a chart);<BR/>&#8226; it did not make a difference if the vision screening was done by itself, or as part of a broader health assessment.</P><P>Cochrane Review authors assessed how certain the evidence was for each review finding. They looked for factors that can make the evidence less certain, such as problems with the way the studies were done, very small studies, and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that can make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as very low certainty, low certainty, moderate certainty or high certainty. This review included mostly high-certainty evidence.</P><P><B>How up to date is this review?</B><BR/>Cochrane Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 23 November 2017.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-09 11:31:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-20 16:23:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Visual problems in older people are common and frequently under-reported. The effects of poor vision in older people are wide reaching and include falls, confusion and reduced quality of life. Much of the visual impairment in older ages can be treated (e.g. cataract surgery, correction of refractive error). Vision screening may therefore reduce the number of older people living with sight loss.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-17 10:15:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects on vision of community vision screening of older people for visual impairment.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-02-09 11:31:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP.

Four trials took place in the UK, two in Australia, two in the United States and two in the Netherlands. Length of follow-up ranged from one to five years. Three of these studies were cluster-randomised trials whereby general practitioners or family physicians were randomly allocated to undertake vision screening or no vision screening. All studies were funded by government agencies. Overall we judged the studies to be at low risk of bias and only downgraded the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) for imprecision.</P><P>Seven trials compared vision screening as part of a multi-component screening versus no screening. Six of these studies used self-reported vision as both screening tool and outcome measure, but did not directly measure vision. One study used a combination of self-reported vision and visual acuity measurement: participants reporting vision problems at screening were treated by the attending doctor, referred to an eye care specialist or given information about resources that were available to assist with poor vision. There was a similar risk of "not seeing well" at follow-up in people screened compared with people not screened in meta-analysis of six studies (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.14, 4522 participants high-certainty evidence). One trial reported "improvement in vision" and this occurred slightly less frequently in the screened group (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.40, 230 participants, moderate-certainty evidence).</P><P>Two trials compared vision screening (visual acuity testing) alone with no vision screening. In one study, distance visual acuity was similar in the two groups at follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.02 logMAR, 95% CI &#8722;0.02 to 0.05, 532 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was also little difference in near acuity (MD 0.02 logMAR, 95% CI &#8722;0.03 to 0.07, 532 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of any important difference in quality of life (MD &#8722;0.06 National Eye Institute 25-item visual function questionnaire (VFQ-25) score adjusted for baseline VFQ-25 score, 95% CI &#8722;2.3 to 1.1, 532 participants, high-certainty evidence). The other study could not be included in the data analysis as the number of participants in each of the arms at follow-up could not be determined. However the authors stated that there was no significant difference in mean visual acuity in participants who had visual acuity assessed at baseline (39 letters) as compared to those who did not have their visual acuity assessed (35 letters, P = 0.25, 121 participants).</P><P>One trial compared a detailed health assessment including measurement of visual acuity (intervention) with a brief health assessment including one question about vision (standard care). People given the detailed health assessment had a similar risk of visual impairment (visual acuity worse than 6/18 in either eye) at follow-up compared with people given the brief assessment (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.36, 1807 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). The mean composite score of the VFQ-25 was 86.0 in the group that underwent visual acuity screening compared with 85.6 in the standard care group, a difference of 0.40 (95% CI &#8722;1.70 to 2.50, 1807 participants, high-certainty evidence).</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-15 10:44:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>The evidence from RCTs undertaken to date does not support vision screening for older people living independently in a community setting, whether in isolation or as part of a multi-component screening package. This is true for screening programmes involving questions about visual problems, or direct measurements of visual acuity.</P><P>The most likely reason for this negative review is that the populations within the trials often did not take up the offered intervention as a result of the vision screening and large proportions of those who did not have vision screening appeared to seek their own intervention. Also, trials that use questions about vision have a lower sensitivity and specificity than formal visual acuity testing. Given the importance of visual impairment among older people, further research into strategies to improve vision of older people is needed. The effectiveness of an optimised primary care-based screening intervention that overcomes possible factors contributing to the observed lack of benefit in trials to date warrants assessment; trials should consider including more dependent participants, rather than those living independently in the community.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-12 15:20:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-03 21:50:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Health services for older people are of increasing importance. In promoting health for older people, in recent years there has been a change in emphasis away from a medically-orientated approach and towards an approach which focuses on the improvement of functional ability and quality of life, often termed 'healthy aging' (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swedish-National-Institute-of-Public-Health-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swedish National Institute of Public Health 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>). Improving sensory function is central to this approach.</P><P>A number of community surveys have demonstrated high levels of undiagnosed and untreated visual impairment among older people (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wormald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 1992</LINK>). A variety of adverse factors have been reported in association with visual impairment including: reduced functional status, social interaction and quality of life; depression; and falls.</P><P>Multi-component assessment of older people was originally developed in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1964</LINK>) and has been introduced in many countries. Multi-component assessment aims to determine an older person's medical, social, psychological and functional problems, and to form a plan for treatment and follow-up. Most forms of this assessment include some attempt to assess vision. While multi-component assessment has been shown to produce some small overall benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Stuck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuck 1993</LINK>), exactly which procedures within the assessment are effective and which are ineffective is uncertain. Specific screening procedures for chronic open-angle glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy have not been included in trials or programmes of multi-component screening assessments.</P><P>Although the aim of improving visual impairment is clearly to produce improvements in other clinical outcomes, (such as improved quality of life or a reduction in falls), any benefit arising from vision assessment will necessarily be dependent on improved vision. Similarly, while the aims of multi-component screening of older people are broad, any benefit arising from the inclusion of a vision component in the assessment will necessarily be dependent on improved vision. Therefore, this review used improvement in vision as the outcome measure of interest.</P><P>Since screening alone without subsequent intervention (e.g. glasses prescription, or other treatment from an eye specialist) cannot be expected to result in improvements in vision, we refer throughout this review to 'screening' being the intervention with implied subsequent intervention.</P></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-17 10:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects on vision of community vision screening of older people for visual impairment.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-05 00:24:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-17 10:36:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-11-17 10:36:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of visual screening alone or as part of multi-component screening in people aged 65 years or over in a community setting.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><P>Participants in the trials were people aged 65 years or over who were not identified as belonging to a particular risk group.</P></CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-08 09:47:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included trials in which there was any attempt at population screening for visual impairment in a community setting, either vision alone or as part of a multi-component screening assessment.</P></CRIT_INTERVENTIONS><CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2017-11-17 10:36:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The outcome included was the degree of visual impairment in the population at the end of the trial.

There were considerable differences in the subsequent follow-up of patients found to have visual problems between studies, but the results of the post hoc sensitivity analysis excluding those studies that did not directly refer to eye specialist services, did not result in differing results of the meta-analysis. Some of the trials provided information regarding the uptake of interventions. In <LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2003</LINK>, for people with visual impairment not thought to be due to refractive error, 35% had seen an ophthalmologist in the past 12 months and a further 14% were registered blind or partially sighted. Both these groups were not eligible for referral. Only around half of those people recommended for referral to an ophthalmologist were actually referred; although when referral did occur, attendance at eye clinics was high. People with worse vision were more likely to be referred and people with evidence of cognitive impairment at the time of screening were less likely to be referred. However, explanations for the low adherence by general practitioners to recommendations for referral are lacking. Around half of those who attended an ophthalmologist following screening had cataract surgery and their vision improved. Among the remaining people who attended an ophthalmologist following screening, there was no improvement in visual acuity. It is possible that some of these people received interventions for low vision that were of benefit in terms of function and quality of life, but that would not be expected to improve visual acuity. However, the result for visual function did not differ in the two trial arms. The study authors concluded that while overall as a result of the visual screening some people obtained beneficial interventions, the numbers of people benefiting was small in the context of a population-based screening programme and were not sufficient to affect the prevalence of visual impairment among all participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Swamy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swamy 2009</LINK>, 135 out of 146 participants (92%) took up treatment or referral. The majority of participants received glasses (92 people out of 135, 68%), 77% of which were delivered within 60 days. However, less than half the participants who were referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist actually received a treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>, 19/20 participants in the intervention group took up the intervention that was recommended following visual screening, as compared to 17/19 participants in the control group. In <LINK REF="STD-Tay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2006</LINK>, 37 out of 42 participants (88%) complied with the recommendation to see an eye-care professional. None of the remaining five trials provided details as to uptake of interventions. Although sparse details are provided on who conducted the screening, it is not clear how effective the communication was between the screener and the participant. It would seem reasonable that the effectiveness of the communication provided may have had an impact on the uptake of interventions: if communication between the screener and participant was poor, they may have felt less inclined to follow the recommendation.</P><P>Secondly, individuals who reported visual problems when prompted to do so in a screening programme may not have perceived their previously unreported visual impairment as a 'need' for intervention. Gradual adjustment to, and assimilation of, reduced visual function may occur with ageing among some people. Therefore, in spite of reporting problems with vision when asked directly, they may not have acted on advice to seek further care. There is very little information on whether older people accept interventions for visual problems discovered by screening. In a randomised trial of multi-component screening in the United States 15 out of 18 older people complied with advice to attend for an eye examination (<LINK REF="STD-Fabacher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fabacher 1994</LINK>). In a United Kingdom general practice-based survey one third of those referred to the eye services with a visual problem did not attend (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 1992</LINK>). In addition to participants not concurring with the need for intervention, there may have been barriers to obtaining help with the eye problems identified. Possible barriers include: costs of further eye tests, glasses and other treatments; and an inability of ophthalmic services to meet demand, for example for cataract extraction. A further reason may be simple acceptance of gradual decline in visual function with age and limited understanding of the potential benefits from intervention.</P><P>Thirdly, trials using questions about vision both for the initial screening assessment and for the outcome assessment may have affected the results. Questions about vision have a low sensitivity and, to a lesser extent, a low specificity for detecting visual impairment when compared to formal acuity testing (<LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 1998a</LINK>). However, in the four trials that measured visual acuity both at the screening assessment and at the outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Eekhof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Eekhof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swamy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swamy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2006</LINK>), the lack of effect of screening on visual outcomes was very similar to the results seen in the remaining trials.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-26 14:24:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All studies within this review included participants who were independent and living in the community and several studies specifically excluded participants who lived in residential or nursing care (<LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rossum-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rossum 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1994</LINK>). Therefore participants in these studies were likely to be able to independently seek ophthalmic intervention should they see a need to do so. This assumption is corroborated by the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Swamy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swamy 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2006</LINK>: 72% of the control arm within <LINK REF="STD-Swamy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swamy 2009</LINK> consulted with an eye-care professional in the preceding 12 months and 74% participants within <LINK REF="STD-Tay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2006</LINK> consulted with an eye care specialist within the study period regardless of baseline recommendation. As such, the findings of this review may not be applicable to more dependent older people living in residential or nursing care. Of note:a previously conducted community survey suggested that over half the visual impairment in this age group could potentially be reduced with treatment included housebound older people (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 1992</LINK>) &#8212; a different population from the trials. Future trials should focus on recruiting participants who are more dependent and less able to seek ophthalmic intervention, as a greater benefit may be derived in this population.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING><P>The certainty of the evidence within this review is graded as 'high', since each of the three comparisons contained high-certainty evidence.</P><P>The statistical estimates of effect were reasonably precise and trials reported consistent results.

Specifically, they found "no significant difference between vision screening in older adults in primary care settings, versus no screening for improving visual acuity or other clinical outcomes." Three randomised controlled trials were included in <LINK REF="REF-Chou-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2016</LINK>, all of which are also included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Eekhof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Eekhof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smeeth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smeeth 2003</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-04 00:05:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-12 17:18:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The evidence from randomised controlled trials undertaken to date does not support vision screening intervention for older people in a community setting. This is true for screening programmes involving questions about visual problems, or direct measurements of visual acuity. Similarly, there was no benefit derived from vision screening in isolation or as part of a multi-component screening package.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-04 00:05:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Given the importance of visual impairment among older people, further research into strategies to improve vision of older people is needed. The effectiveness of an optimised primary care-based screening intervention that overcomes possible factors contributing to the observed lack of benefit in trials to date warrants assessment.</P><P>There are a number of unresolved issues around optimal tools to be used for screening for visual impairment, particularly in the context of multidimensional screening in primary care. Whether visual acuity is a good screening tool to identify people who are likely to benefit from interventions to improve their vision needs to be assessed. The value of screening for other measures such as visual fields or contrast sensitivity warrants further work. While single questions about self-reported visual difficulties are poor predictors of low visual acuity, the development of brief screening instruments that assess visual function could be of great value (<LINK REF="REF-Iliffe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iliffe 2005</LINK>).</P><P>With regards to multidimensional assessment for older people, in the one trial with data on this issue the low level of ophthalmological referrals for those people deemed eligible for referral following screening was notable. There is scope for more research on the determinants of clinician adherence to recommendations for referrals arising from multidimensional assessments. Specific issues of interest are assessing the appropriateness of the referral decisions made and the role of the patient in the decision whether to refer or not.</P><P>The effectiveness of an increased role for optometry services in the detection and management of visual problems among older people on a population basis warrants evaluation.</P><P>Detailed prospective research on the detection, referral, diagnosis and management of visual problems in older people could help shed further light on the reasons for the ineffectiveness of screening. As well as looking at health service issues, research from the perspective of the older people themselves is also needed. Areas which particularly need to be addressed include: older people's perceptions of their visual problems and of the need for interventions; and perceived barriers to interventions to help their vision.</P><P>There is also a need to evaluate the impact of vision screening in more dependent populations of older people. The findings of two studies in this review highlighted that many of the control arm participants sought assessment from an eye care speciality independently (<LINK REF="STD-Swamy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swamy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2006</LINK>). Participants who live in residential or nursing homes are arguably less able to seek help when needed and therefore there may be greater benefit to providing visual screening in this subpopulation.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-01 18:05:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><UL><LI>We are very appreciative to Professor Steve Iliffe (SI), for his contributions as author of the previous version of this review.</LI><LI>We would like to thank all the study authors who responded to requests for additional information.
