<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-07 13:50:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a common and important disorder that includes episodes of depression, mixed states or mania. Depression includes low mood and energy, as well as lack of enjoyment, often combined with other problems such as sleep disturbance. Mania includes the opposite, with 'too much' energy and problems with high mood or irritation. In mixed states, the symptoms of depression and mania are combined. These mood episodes usually happen several times in an individual's life, so long-term treatment (maintenance treatment) can be very important in preventing relapse and recurrence. As valproate is a drug that may be useful in treating the acute phase of bipolar disorder, in this review we wanted to answer the following question: Is valproate useful as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder?</P>
<P>We searched, in a wide-ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials, or RCTs) we could find on long-term treatment of people with bipolar disorder using valproate or any other mood stabiliser, or antipsychotic drugs, or placebo. Three of us looked at RCTs to make sure they were fair experiments. We extracted data from the studies, put all of the evidence together and carried out a statistical analysis to look for significant results.</P>
<P>We conducted these searches to 11 January 2013 and found six studies, including a total of 876 participants. The quality of the studies in terms of design was not good, which means that the effects of some drugs might have been overestimated. All of the trials taken together suggest that valproate might help to prevent relapse in bipolar disorder, especially depressive episodes. However, because of limited available evidence, conclusions on valproate compared with placebo and lithium (or other active drugs) cannot be made with any reliable degree of confidence. Lithium is an important drug to compare with valproate because lithium is already known to be effective in preventing relapses of bipolar disorder. When we combined the findings of all studies comparing valproate with lithium, the evidence did not favour valproate or lithium in terms of efficacy. People taking valproate over a long time were more likely than patients given lithium to keep taking their allocated medication. Clinicians and patients should consider the side effects of valproate, including alopecia, tremor and weight gain.</P>
<P>We also found a study that compared valproate taken alone with valproate combination therapy (two drugs taken at the same time). This study compared people who took lithium only or valproate only with people who took valproate and lithium together. No evidence showed that use of valproate and lithium compared with lithium alone helped to ensure that patients kept taking their allocated medication.</P>

<P>Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness that is amongst the top 30 causes of disability worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. In the past, emphasis was placed solely on the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder; recently, the importance of episode prevention and of minimisation of iatrogenicity has been recognised. For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use, and it remains an agent of first choice in the preventative treatment of bipolar disorder. However, an estimated 20% to 40% of patients may not respond adequately to lithium. Valproate is an anticonvulsant drug that has been shown to be effective in acute mania and is frequently used in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When the acceptability of long-term treatment is considered, together with efficacy, the adverse event profile of a medication is also important. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2009.</P>

<P>Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) (to January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-24 13:09:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Three review authors independently extracted data. A double-entry procedure was employed by two review authors. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. For dichotomous data, risk ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For statistically significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). For continuous data, mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated along with 95% CIs. MDs were used when the same scale was used to measure an outcome; SMDs were employed when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. The primary analysis used a fixed-effect model. Binary outcomes were calculated on a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; dropouts were included in this analysis. When data were missing and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-23 07:56:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Six randomised controlled trials (overall 876 participants) lasting 6 to 24 months were included. Two studies (overall 312 participants) compared valproate with placebo, four studies (overall 618 participants) valproate with lithium, one study (overall 23 participants) valproate with olanzapine and one study (overall 220 participants) valproate with the combination of valproate plus lithium. In terms of study quality, most studies reported the methods used to generate random sequence; however, only one study reported enough details on allocation concealment. Four of six included studies described their design as &#8220;double blind&#8221;, but only two trials reported full details about blinding. Valproate was more effective than placebo in preventing study withdrawal due to any mood episode (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93; NNTB 8), but no difference in efficacy was found between valproate and lithium (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). Valproate was associated with fewer participants dropping out of treatment for any cause when compared with placebo or lithium (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95 and RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98, respectively). However, combination therapy with lithium plus valproate was more likely to prevent relapse than was monotherapy with valproate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96). Significant differences in adverse event frequencies were found, and lithium was associated with more frequent diarrhoea, polyuria, increased thirst and enuresis, whereas valproate was associated with increased sedation and infection.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-24 08:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Limited evidence supports the efficacy of valproate in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-24 09:12:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar disorder (or bipolar affective disorder, or manic depressive disorder) refers to a group of affective disorders that together are characterised by marked mood swings between mania (mood elevation) and depression that cause significant personal distress or social dysfunction, and are not caused by drugs or known physical disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2013</LINK>). Bipolar type I disorder is diagnosed when episodes of depression are interspersed with mania. Bipolar type II disorder is diagnosed when depression is interspersed with less severe episodes of elevated mood (hypomania) that do not lead to dysfunction or disability (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_Oerlinghausen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller-Oerlinghausen 2002</LINK>). Lifetime prevalence rates of bipolar type I disorder range from 0.3% to 1.5% in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Weissmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissmann 1996</LINK>). Men and women are at similar risk, and mean age at first onset ranges from 19 to 29 years (an average of six years earlier than first onset of major depression). The cause of bipolar disorder is uncertain, although family and twin studies suggest a genetic basis (<LINK REF="REF-Craddock-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craddock 2013</LINK>). Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness in which affective episodes of varying form may produce lasting destructive effects on sufferers' psychological, professional and social welfare (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Pinto-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Pinto 2010</LINK>). Its chronic and recurrent nature places it amongst the top 30 causes of disability worldwide, especially in the age group of 15 to 44 years (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). A meta-analysis undertaken to compare observed versus expected rates of suicide in an age- and sex-matched sample of the general population found that the lifetime prevalence of suicide in people with bipolar disorder was about 2%&#8212;about 15 times greater than would be expected (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-24 09:15:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>&#8216;Mood stabilisers&#8217; are defined as drugs that alleviate the frequency and/or intensity of manic, depressive or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder and, further, do not increase the frequency or severity of any of the subtypes or course variables of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>). For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use, and it remains a first choice in the preventative treatment of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CANMAT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CANMAT 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2013</LINK>). However, an estimated 20% to 40% of patients may not respond adequately to lithium. In particular, a high incidence of inadequate response has been noted in individuals with rapid cycling disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Post-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Post 1989</LINK>), a variant of bipolar disorder associated with greater morbidity and mortality than its classic form, including greater risk of suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcett-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcett 1990</LINK>). A search for adjunctive and alternative treatments to lithium has uncovered evidence that other medications, including anticonvulsant agents (e.g. valproic acid, carbamazepine) and several atypical antipsychotics, have mood-stabilising properties. Valproic acid (together with sodium valproate or valproate sodium, either of which is a sodium salt of valproic acid) is an anticonvulsant that is used also in neurology for the treatment of patients with epilepsy and migraine; in Europe it has been used since 1966 as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 1966</LINK>).<BR/>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-24 09:19:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Valproic acid and its derivatives, hereafter given the generic term 'valproate', are weak blockers of sodium ion channels that produce a weak inhibitor of enzymes that deactivate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (such as GABA transaminase) (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcett 1989</LINK>). The exact mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of valproate in treating bipolar disorder remain unclear. However, it seems unlikely that GABAergic transmission is related to the psychotropic action of valproate, as other different molecular mechanisms might be involved, such as serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission, energy metabolism and neuronal membrane lipid synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Winterer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winterer 2000</LINK>). Recently, amongst other potential mechanisms of action, neurotrophic and neuroplastic effects of valproate have been explored (<LINK REF="REF-Schloesser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schloesser 2008</LINK>). Valproate has a complex pharmacokinetic profile that follows a three-compartment model and shows protein-binding saturation. Monitoring of plasma level is supposedly, therefore, of more limited use than with carbamazepine or lithium. A dose of at least 750 mg/d or a serum level of at least 50 mg/L may be associated with response (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1997</LINK>). The therapeutic dose usually ranges between 1000 and 1500 mg/d but can reach a maximum of 2000 mg/d. Valproate is highly protein bound (up to 94%). Other drugs that are highly protein bound can displace valproate from albumin and precipitate toxicity (e.g. aspirin). Valproate is hepatically metabolised and can increase the plasma levels of some drugs, possibly by inhibiting their metabolism (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, lamotrigine).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-24 09:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until the recent millennium, valproate was recommended as a second-line prophylactic agent in bipolar disorder and a first-line choice in rapid cycling disorder in the United States of America and in Great Britain (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maudsley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maudsley 2001</LINK>). Notwithstanding its sometimes troublesome side effect profile, valproate is still frequently used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2013</LINK>). Side effects of valproate include neurological symptoms such as tremor, sedation and ataxia (especially with concomitant administration of other anticonvulsants or neuroleptics), alopecia, lethargy, dizziness, haematological dysfunction, hepatic failure and other gastrointestinal complaints. Asymptomatic elevation in hepatic transaminases may occur. Pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity are rare but potentially serious and fatal complications. Possible induction of polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism with long-term valproate treatment has been reported, especially in young females (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 1998</LINK>). Teratogenicity has been reported in the form of neural tube defects associated with first trimester use (<LINK REF="REF-Jeavons-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeavons 1982</LINK>), congenital heart lesions, digital anomalies, oral clefts and craniofacial dysmorphic features (<LINK REF="REF-Dukes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dukes 1996</LINK>). It has also been found that the use of valproate in pregnancy was associated with a reduction in cognitive functioning in the children of mothers with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Adab-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adab 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adab-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adab 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meador-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2009</LINK>). Concerns regarding teratogenicity led to the recommendation by the United Kingdom National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) that valproate should not be prescribed routinely for women of child-bearing potential (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>). Over the past decade, the range of agents available for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has expanded, and new efficacy and safety data on the use of valproate have become available. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2009</LINK>). In light of recent developments, this re-appraisal of valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder is due and timely.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">CCDAN's specialised register (CCDANCTR)</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at its editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains more than 31,500 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register, and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details.</P>
<P>Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, and handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Details of <A HREF="http://ccdan.cochrane.org/search-strategies-identification-studies">CCDAN's generic search strategies</A> can be found at the Group's website.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous, or event-like, data, the risk ratio (RR) was calculated with its 95% confidence interval (CI).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with 95% CIs. MDs were used when the same scale was used to measure an outcome; SMDs were employed when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. Continuous data on clinical outcomes often are not normally distributed, and skewed data were presented descriptively. If papers reported a mean and a standard deviation (SD), as well as an absolute minimum possible value for the outcome, we divided the mean by the SD. If this value was less than two, then we concluded that some indication of skewness was present. If the value was less than one (i.e. the SD was bigger than the mean), then skewness was almost certainly present. If papers did not report the skewness and simply reported means, SDs and sample sizes, these numbers were used. Because these data may not have been properly analysed and can be misleading, analyses were conducted with and without these studies. If the data were log-transformed for analysis, and the geometric means were reported, skewness was reduced. This is the recommended method for analysis of skewed data (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs when an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, participants can differ systematically from their initial state, even despite a wash-out phase. For this reason, we planned to use only data from the first phase of the cross-over studies. No cross-over studies were identified for this version of the review. Given that cross-over trials for which only first period data are available should be considered to be at risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), careful attention will be paid to retrieve only unbiased data available from such studies in the next updates of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>No cluster randomised trials were found for this version of the review. Should they be identified in a future update, we will attempt to adjust for the effects of clustering using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In fact this is seldom available in published reports, so a common approach is to use external estimates obtained from similar studies; several resources are available that provide examples of ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our conclusions, as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>For a particular multi-arm study, the intervention groups of relevance to a systematic review are all those that could be included in a pair-wise comparison of intervention groups that, if investigated alone, would meet the criteria for inclusion of studies in the review. Each meta-analysis addresses only a single pair-wise comparison, so we first considered whether a study of each possible pair-wise comparison of interventions in the study was eligible for the meta-analysis. Then, several possible approaches to including a study with multiple intervention groups could be used in a particular meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For binary outcomes, we decided to combine all relevant experimental intervention groups of the study into a single experimental group, and to combine all relevant control intervention groups into a single control group. For continuous outcomes, we decided to combine means and standard deviations using methods described in Chapter 7 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I>.</P>

<P>Binary outcomes were calculated on a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: Dropouts were included in this analysis. When data were missing and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used. When standard deviations (SDs) were missing, we presented data descriptively. When SDs were not reported, authors were asked to supply the data. When only the standard error (SE) or <I>t</I>-statistics or the P value was reported, we calculated SDs in accordance with <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>.</P>

<P>All analyses used a fixed-effect model. We decided to use a fixed-effect model as the primary analysis because by including only RCTs with standardised dose regimens, similar clinical management and narrow diagnostic inclusion criteria, we did not expect to see significant clinical heterogeneity. However, the robustness of this summary measure was routinely examined by checking the random-effects model, which has the greatest generalisability in our empirical examination of summary effect measures for meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002a</LINK>).

About three-fifths of the participants included in the study recruiting children and adolescents only (<LINK REF="STD-Findling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2005</LINK>) were prescribed concomitant psychostimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms (35 of 60, 58.3%), but randomisation was stratified on the basis of three factors: age (5 to 11 or 12 to 17 years), presence/absence of rapid cycling and whether the individual had comorbid ADHD. All studies employed a discontinuation design (randomly assigning participants before long-term, relapse prevention treatment was provided).</P>

In the included studies, almost all participants used lithium or valproate within the therapeutic dose range. Valproate or divalproex as orally administered was used in all trials. Blood levels of valproate were monitored in all trials. The tapering discontinuation of medications in the run-up to maintenance treatment was explicitly gradual in <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2000</LINK> (two weeks), <LINK REF="STD-Calabrese-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Calabrese 2005</LINK> (average six weeks), <LINK REF="STD-Findling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2005</LINK> (eight weeks) and <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-BALANCE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">BALANCE 2010</LINK> (four weeks), presumably to avoid rebound. <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK> recruited participants who were euthymic at the moment of recruitment, with no run-in phase.

No disagreement between the raters occurred. The methodological quality of these included studies was questionable overall. Even though it is not possible to predict the direction or magnitude of bias associated with lack of adequate sequence generation or adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Odgaard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgaard-Jensen 2011</LINK>), this type of reporting has been associated with an overestimate of the effect of investigational drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), and this should be considered when the review results are interpreted.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-24 12:07:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review of six randomised controlled trials comparing valproate with placebo or other active drugs in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder showed that valproate is more effective than placebo in preventing study withdrawals due to an episode of mood disorder (especially, depressive episode), but it is not materially different from lithium in terms of overall efficacy. However, only two studies compared valproate with placebo, and in the study that had the larger sample, valproate was no better than placebo on the primary efficacy measure. No reliable evidence suggested a difference between valproate and lithium (pooled RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20), although the confidence interval is consistent  with a 13% relative reduction in the risk in favour of valproate and a 20% reduction in the risk consistent with lithium. No statistically significant difference was noted between valproate and lithium in terms of prevention of manic episodes (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.44) or depressive episodes (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49). In both cases, however, the direction of the effect favoured lithium, and a post hoc<I> </I>sensitivity analysis, including or excluding <LINK REF="STD-Findling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2005</LINK> (which used slightly different definitions of outcome), had no material effect on the overall estimate. The apparent benefit of valproate compared with placebo was of a similar size to the advantage of valproate plus lithium compared with lithium monotherapy. Taken together, these suggest that valproate has some preventative efficacy in bipolar disorder. However, when compared with combination therapy with lithium, valproate alone did not show any clinical advantage, as combination therapy was more likely to prevent relapse than was monotherapy with valproate. Even though it was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events such as alopecia, tremor and weight gain than placebo, valproate was more acceptable than lithium, as it was associated with a lower risk for participants to withdraw from treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-24 13:10:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retrieved randomised evidence compared valproate with a selection of possible comparator drugs, but only a few studies were found per comparison. The evidence that valproate is more effective than placebo was derived from only one moderately sized RCT and one very small RCT. By contrast, for the comparison between valproate and lithium, results were numerically more robust, as we found four RCTs. The identified studies were sufficient to address many, but not all, of the outcomes originally specified in the review protocol.</P>
<P>In this review, we included only RCTs, and one of the main limitations of efficacy trials involves including participants far from the &#8220;real world&#8221;. Proper randomisations and reliable inclusion and exclusion criteria may help create two or more groups that do not differ. However, the external validity of study findings might be limited (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>). Generalisability of these findings can be extended only to patients who are likely to be enrolled in a randomised trial, and results from systematic reviews of RCTs should be integrated with available high-quality observational evidence, which may inform better about the adverse events that cannot be fully assessed in RCTs only.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-24 12:11:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With summary statistics, the quality of information is important for interpreting results and for usefulness of results in practice. Use of high-quality research evidence is relevant for reviewing results and facilitating the translation of research in a way that can answer clinically relevant questions. However, the quality of RCTs is not easy to assess. Despite the fact that randomised clinical trials provide the best research design by which to answer questions about efficacy and acceptability of treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009b</LINK>), the six studies included in this review (876 participants overall) failed to report key methodological issues. For example, a great majority of trials still do not report adequate information about allocation concealment. Meta-analyses of poor-quality studies may be seriously misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2005</LINK>) because the bias associated with defects in the conduct of primary studies can seriously affect overall estimates of intervention. Even though reporting of outcomes in the included studies was sometimes unclear or incomplete (only graphs, no SDs), and the figures used for the analyses were not immediately understandable, the scant information about allocation concealment may be more a matter of reporting in the text than of real defects in study design.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-10-03 16:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>Although the search was thorough, it is possible that unpublished studies have not been identified, but the small number of trials identified per comparison hinders the detection of any publication bias. We are also aware that a number of further randomised controlled trials comparing valproate with other drugs are currently being conducted and will be included in future updates of the review.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>For several comparisons, the data came from just one study (e.g. valproate vs olanzapine, valproate plus lithium vs valproate alone), and results from this review should be interpreted with caution.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We found only one large placebo-controlled RCT that investigated the efficacy and acceptability of valproate maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder. This study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2000</LINK>) is one of the largest trials of maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder ever undertaken; however, the results are equivocal. The practical difficulties caused by the inclusion of a placebo-treated group led to the inclusion of a less severely affected group of participants than is generally found in clinical practice. A higher relapse rate was anticipated than was actually found, which meant that the study had insufficient power to detect reliably a moderate, but clinically important, treatment effect. Moreover, a 52-week follow-up was probably rather short for a maintenance study. Despite its short duration, a large number of participants withdrew from the study, especially in the lithium group. Finally, during the up to 3-month run-in phase, the index manic episode was treated at the discretion of the investigator, and 117 participants had been treated with valproate only (31.5%), 124 with lithium only (33.3%), 50 with both drugs (usually sequentially) (13.4%) and 81 with neither drug (21.8%). Given that 187 participants were subsequently randomly assigned to valproate, 91 to lithium and 94 to placebo (2:1:1 randomisation scheme), and that participants taking valproate or lithium on the day of randomisation had the drug gradually withdrawn over a 2-week time, this design might have favoured valproate over placebo and lithium. The primary analysis used in <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2000</LINK> was a comparison of survival curves in the treatment arms. This primary analysis found no significant differences between treatment groups, although the comparison between lithium and valproate tended to favour the latter. In our analysis, without access to individual participant data, we simply used the number of participants leaving the study because of recurrence during the study. We found a statistically significant benefit for valproate compared with placebo. This result is rather surprising because the time-to-event analysis is more efficient. In other words, because it makes fuller use of the data, other things being equal, it is more likely to detect an effect should one exist. It is possible that the discrepancy is explained by the large number of dropouts, which occurred at different rates in each arm, and the number of censored observations. Therefore, although our analysis suggests that valproate is more efficacious than placebo in preventing mood episodes, the effect is not robust to the choice of analysis, and the true efficacy of valproate therefore remains uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>According to review protocol, we included non-blind studies (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BALANCE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">BALANCE 2010</LINK>). As all RCTs used an open-label design, outcome assessment should be done very carefully to reduce the risk of performance and ascertainment biases. In <LINK REF="STD-BALANCE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">BALANCE 2010</LINK>, this risk was managed by restriction of randomisation to participants for whom there was no strong treatment preference on the part of the participant or the clinician and by careful verification of outcomes: All outcome events were considered by the trial management team, who were masked to treatment assignment, and in the case of any doubt, a description of the event was sent to an independent adjudication team.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We considered the all-cause discontinuation rate as a measure of acceptability of treatment. Even though it has been employed in many other systematic reviews in the field of long-term treatment for bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2010</LINK>) and also for unipolar depression (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omori 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2012</LINK>), this choice might be questioned. We believe that early drug discontinuation is highly clinically relevant from a clinical point of view because it is one of the most important things the psychiatrist wants to know when starting the prescription of an effective long term treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Our decision to use fixed-effect meta-analysis could have introduced a bias in the review process, as there was some visual indication of heterogeneity, although this was rarely statistically significant and so could simply indicate random error. Overall, we believe that the fixed-effect average is probably the best estimate for guiding clinical practice. The two largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BALANCE-2010" TYPE="STUDY">BALANCE 2010</LINK>) reported conflicting estimates, which contributed to the final heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 25%). However, this result was robust to the choice of statistical method because no material differences were noted between the random-effects models and the fixed-effect models.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The relative risk of serious adverse events or death between valproate and other agents or placebo was not significant; however, included trials were not powered to detect any mortality difference. Because of the low numbers of events, random error is substantial, and estimates of treatment effect are consequently unstable with wide confidence intervals. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials may increase statistical power, but absolute numbers of participants who have rare adverse events such as completed or attempted suicide are low (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005a</LINK>), and a few events in one direction or another can completely change the overall outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005b</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>It is known that Axis I and Axis II psychiatric comorbidity is of clinical interest, especially for bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Bassett--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassett 2012</LINK>). However, evidence suggests that bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are most likely separate disorders and that benefits of mood stabilisers are more predictable in bipolar disorder than in borderline personality disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Paris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paris 2007</LINK>). Therefore, we decided to exclude studies that recruited participants with Axis II comorbidity. Even though our inclusion criteria were aimed at higher internal validity (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>), our choice might have limited the external validity of review findings because In clinical practice, patient populations are usually highly heterogeneous.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We found no reports of teratogenic effects, but randomised controlled trials are not intended or designed to evaluate this very important aspect of treatment. Treatment guidelines recommend that valproate should not be routinely used in women of child-bearing potential in primary or secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2009</LINK>). If no effective alternative treatment to valproate can be used, then the patient should be made aware of the risks of taking valproate in pregnancy, and effective contraception should be used (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>).</LI>

<P>Despite the increasingly widespread use of valproate in bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2011</LINK>), only one systematic review about the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder has been published in the scientific literature since the first publication of the present review in 2001. The review by Soares and colleagues was published in 2007 and included a total of seven randomised or quasi-randomised trials that investigated the efficacy of valproate (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2007</LINK>). Three studies included in <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2007</LINK> were excluded from the present review because we specifically included only randomised trials with a relapse prevention design, which did not recruit acutely ill patients for long-term treatment. Notwithstanding these differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria, results from these two systematic reviews are consistent overall. Valproate was found to be effective as maintenance therapy for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder, but it was possibly more efficacious for the prevention of depressive relapses rather than manic relapses.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-24 12:29:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>A key clinical question is whether valproate or lithium should be favoured as the first-line therapy in the prevention of recurrence in bipolar disorder. Given the lack of clear findings of this review and the limited amount of evidence obtained, conclusions on the efficacy and acceptability of valproate compared with placebo and lithium cannot be made with any degree of confidence. The evidence of efficacy for valproate versus placebo (in terms of both total participants randomised and independently replicated results) is less robust when compared with the more substantial evidence for the efficacy of lithium versus placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2001</LINK>). Clinicians should always individualise the best maintenance drug treatment for each patient, in accordance with the efficacy and tolerability of long-term treatments of documented efficacy. However, in making such clinical decisions, clinicians and patients may wish to consider evidence from a related review that highlights other important factors. These may include differences in the efficacy of drugs in acute treatment of mania (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2011</LINK>) and the relative acceptability and tolerability of valproate and lithium. In terms of safety, lithium and valproate had different side effect profiles. Our analysis suggests that valproate may be better tolerated than lithium, but comparatively high lithium levels were used in the trial, and it has been shown that informed management of lithium plasma levels may ensure both improved utility and improved outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Mahli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahli 2012</LINK>). Moreover, a combination therapy with lithium plus valproate may be an option if the patient can tolerate the combination; however, this suggestion is based on evidence from a single study.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-24 12:31:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Longer-term and larger sample size RCTs, with clinically appropriate designs, are needed, preferentially conducted independent of the manufacturer, to examine the relative efficacy and acceptability of valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. The review of lithium in maintenance therapy concluded that, although the total number of participants randomly assigned was rather small, reasonable evidence for the efficacy of lithium was found (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2001</LINK>). We would therefore argue that it is unnecessary for future studies to include a placebo arm: The ethical and practical costs of doing so outweigh the possible benefits. Future trials need to compare valproate with other mood-stabilising agents that have not been compared with valproate so far (e.g. carbamazepine, atypical antipsychotics) and must be of sufficient duration to inform real-life clinical decision making. Good-quality trials of valproate are needed: Analysis should be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, and power calculations should be undertaken by using realistic estimates of recurrence rates. Trial outcomes should include measures that are meaningful to patients and clinicians, and recorded side effects should reflect the concerns of patients. Finally, although it is unclear whether valproate exhibits discontinuation effects similar to those exhibited by lithium, trial design should avoid rapid discontinuation of any mood stabiliser.</P>
<P>Even though two of the included studies focused on rapid cycling disorder, they were very small, and there remains a need for additional evidence on the use of valproate in such populations of patients.</P>

<P>For the purposes of this review, we used withdrawal from the study because of the occurrence of an episode of mood disorder as the main outcome measure. This was not the primary outcome measure used in the original study, which is now discussed in detail. In the original study, the primary outcome measure was time to next mood episode. Secondary outcome measures were time to manic episode, time to depressive episode and average change from baseline in scores on the Mania Rating Scale, the Depression Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment Scale during maintenance treatment. As the trial progressed, the initial outcome measures were revised at the suggestion of reviewers. A manic episode was defined as being represented by a Mania Rating Scale of 16 or greater, or requiring hospital admission. A depressive episode was defined as one requiring antidepressant use or premature discontinuation of the study because of symptoms. Patients with Depression Syndrome Scale scores of 25 or higher were treated with sertraline or paroxetine, and their data were censored from the analyses of time to mania relapse on the day that antidepressant treatment began. The Schedule of Affective Disorders and the Schizophrenia-Change version, augmented by the addition of eleven items to the Mania Rating Scale, were used to measure symptom severity</P>

<P>Quote: "Double-blind, double-substitution methodology was used to transition patients from open-label combination therapy with both medications to double-blind monotherapy. Patients were started on equal numbers of capsules of double-blind active lithium 300-mg capsules and matching (in colour, taste, and size) lithium placebo capsules, and equal numbers of double-blind active valproate in 250-mg capsules and matching valproate placebo capsules.... Patients randomly assigned to monotherapy had one blinded active capsule replaced with a matching placebo capsule once every 2 weeks for as long as necessary. The process of tapering to monotherapy took place over an average of 6 weeks if patients were taking 1200 mg of lithium or 1500 mg of valproate&#8212;longer if the doses of either were higher and more quickly if the doses of either were lower. After the taper was completed, matching placebo for the drug that was discontinued was discontinued for the rest of the maintenance phase. This slow, gradual process of transitioning patients to monotherapy obscured the progress of the taper until completed. The maintenance phase began at the beginning of the taper, and the survival analysis began at that time as well. After the taper was completed, the number of capsules of active compound and placebo was unchanged for the rest of the maintenance phase, except for adjustments made to both by the unblinded medical monitor when blood levels decreased to less than 0.8 meq/liter for lithium and 50 &#956;g/mL for valproate"</P>

Time from randomisation to event was summarised by Kaplan-Meier curves, and compared with the log rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated with Cox&#8217;s regression to estimate size of the treatment effect. The proportional hazards assumption was tested formally with analysis of Schoenfeld residuals. An analysis adjusting for minimisation factors was also done. Because BALANCE had very specific hypotheses and only one outcome of primary importance, we made no formal adjustment for multiple significance testing.
