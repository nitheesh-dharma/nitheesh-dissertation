<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-13 09:58:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to demonstrate the effects of giving oxygen before tracheal suctioning for preterm babies receiving mechanical ventilation. A baby born too early (before 34 weeks gestation) often has immature lungs. This is a major cause of breathing failure and death. Mechanical ventilation (machine assisted breathing) keeps the baby breathing and reduces the risk of lung injury and disease. Endotracheal suctioning (removing unwanted fluid through the windpipe) is a routine part of mechanical ventilation, but can have serious complications such as pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Giving oxygen just before suctioning (preoxygenation) may minimise the risk of these complications. The review of trials did not find enough evidence on the effects of preoxygenation. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Endotracheal suctioning for mechanically ventilated infants is routine practice in neonatal intensive care. However, this practice is associated with serious complications including lobar collapse, pneumothorax, bradycardia and hypoxaemia. Increasing the inspired oxygen immediately prior to suction (preoxygenation) has been proposed as an intervention that may minimise the risk of these complications. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:50:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the effects of preoxygenation with no preoxygenation for endotracheal suctioning on ventilated newborn infants.

<P>Random or quasi-random controlled trials of mechanically ventilated neonates in which endotracheal suctioning with preoxygenation was compared to suctioning without preoxygenation. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:52:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Neonatal Review Group were used, including independent assessment of trial quality and extraction of data by the authors. Data were analysed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale with the use of 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One cross-over trial involving outcomes for 16 preterm neonates was included in this review (Walsh 1987). Preoxygenation prior to an endotracheal suctioning procedure involving two suctions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in infants with hypoxaemia (Tc PO2 &lt;40 mmHg) at the end of the first suction (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05, 0.69), at the end of the second suction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08, 0.66) and also at 120 seconds after the second suction (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01, 0.69). Mean Tc PO2 was statistically significantly higher in the preoxygenation group at the end of the first suction (MD 25.00 mmHg, 95%CI 14.20, 35.80), second suction (MD 24.80, 95% CI 14.80, 34.80) and also at 120 seconds after the second suction (MD 29.10, 95% CI 14.96, 43.24). The time taken to return to baseline oxygenation status was shorter than the group not receiving preoxygenation (MD -2.12 minutes, 95% CI -3.82, -0.42).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:53:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review does not provide sufficient evidence on which to base practice. Although preoxygenation was shown to decrease hypoxemia at the time of suctioning, this result comes from only one small poor quality trial in which other clinically important outcomes were not assessed. Further studies are needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:54:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assisted mechanical ventilation is the mainstay of management of a variety of conditions affecting the neonate. However, there are a number of potential hazards associated with this life saving intervention. The presence of an endotracheal tube causes soft tissue irritation and increased secretions which increases the likelihood of tube blockage and lobar collapse. Endotracheal suctioning aims to reduce the problems resulting from build-up of secretions and tube obstruction such as discomfort, hypoxemia, hypercapnia and lobar collapse. The practice of endotracheal suctioning is therefore routine practice in neonatal intensive care.</P>
<P>However, there are a number of complications associated with this procedure that have been well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaughan-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughan 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simbruner-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simbruner 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Alpan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alpan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drew-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drew 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macpherson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macpherson 1988</LINK>; Mehrabani 1991; <LINK REF="REF-Shorten-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorten 1991</LINK>), including hypoxemia, bradycardia, tachycardia, atelectasis, pneumonia, fluctuations in blood pressure and intracranial pressure, localised trauma to the airway, sepsis and tube dislodgement.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:54:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Protocols for endotracheal care vary widely between institutions and, in general, are not based on sound evidence. Practices vary in relation to the use of normal saline instillation, chest wall vibrations and percussion, adaptors to enable closed methods of suction, increasing of ventilatory pressures and rate, manual ventilation, number of operators, suctioning frequency, and preoxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tolles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolles 1990</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-17 16:54:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preoxygenation is a technique of increasing inspired oxygen immediately prior to the suction procedure to increase arterial oxygen saturation. It has been suggested that preoxygenation may minimise the hypoxemia and other adverse effects associated with endotracheal suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1989</LINK>). However, this intervention may cause hyperoxia, which is associated with oxygen free radical damage. There is emerging data to suggest that oxygen free radical damage is associated with major morbidity (periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease) with the potential for major long-term sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Tolles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolles 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inder 2000</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-19 14:05:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four major sources of potential bias and methods of avoidance of these biases were considered when assessing trial quality; 1) Selection bias - blinding of randomization; 2) Performance bias - blinding of intervention; 3) Attrition bias - complete follow-up; 4) Detection bias - blinding of outcome assessment. The Cochrane Neonatal Group bases its quality assessments on systematic assessment of the opportunity for each of these biases to arise. Thus, the review authors judged from the report of the trial whether each of the criteria (methods of avoidance) was met. Each criterion was given a rating of either A if Yes (Adequate), B if Can't Tell (Unclear), or C if No (Inadequate). The quality assessment rating included in the Table of Included Studies refers to blinding of randomization alone.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by two review authors (MP, VF) who then compared and resolved differences. Additional information was sought for all identified potentially eligible studies on randomization method. However, at the time of the review no correspondence was received.</P>
<P>For the update in 2009, the risk of bias table was completed in order to address the following questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? </LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </LI>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1987</LINK>: The included study utilised a cross-over design and involved 21 infants. Participants were preterm infants with gestational age 31.4 (± 2.5) weeks, birthweight 1586 (± 682) grams and postnatal age at enrolment 4 (± 4.5) days [(Mean (SD)]. All infants were mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress with FiO2 &gt; 0.30.</P>
<P>In this study, two suctioning procedures were compared. Procedure A included the following sequence of events: chest vibration using a hand held vibrator for two minutes, instillation of normal saline, reconnection to ventilator for 30 seconds, endotracheal tube suctioning with infant's head to one side, returned to ventilator for 30 seconds, second endotracheal suctioning with head on the opposite side, and then returned to ventilator. Procedure B included the same sequence of events as described in procedure A with the addition of preoxygenation, which involved an increase in FiO2 until Tc PO2 reached between 90 -100 mmHg and stabilised for two minutes. Following suction the FiO2 was gradually reduced to base line setting. Each infant was studied for one suction in each of the two procedures.</P>
<P>The trial measured effects of preoxygenation prior to suctioning on hypoxemia and bradycardia. Transcutaneous oxygen (Tc PO2) values were reported at ten time points over a suctioning procedure. In this review, data is presented for three of these measurement points, chosen because of clinical relevance. These points are: 1) end of first endotracheal suction 2) end of second endotracheal suction and 3) at 120 seconds from the end of second suction.</P>
<P>The number of infants with hypoxemia (defined as Tc PO2 &lt;40 mmHg) and mean Tc PO2 were measured at these points. Other outcomes include Tc PO2 recovery (time taken for Tc PO2 to return to baseline values) and the numbers of infants experiencing bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 100 beats per minute during the suctioning procedure).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1987</LINK>) is considered to be of poor quality: blinding of randomization and outcome assessment are unknown; of the 21 infants enrolled in this study five were excluded from analysis; three infants had only one procedure performed and two were considered too ill to receive the full suction procedure.</P>

<P>
<B>SUCTIONING WITH PREOXYGENATION VS. WITHOUT PREOXYGENATION (COMPARISON 01):</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>One study contributed data to this review (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1987</LINK>). This study reported outcomes of oxygenation status and bradycardia over the suction episode.</P>
<P>
<B>Oxygenation (Outcomes 01.01 - 01.06):</B>
<BR/>Preoxygenation prior to suctioning resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of infants with hypoxemia (Tc PO2 &lt; 40 mmHg) at the end of the first suction (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05, 0.69) and at the end of the second suction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08, 0.66) and also at 120 seconds post second suction (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01, 0.69). </P>
<P>The mean Tc PO2 was statistically significantly higher in the preoxygenation group at the end of first suction (MD 25.00 mmHg, 95%CI 14.20, 35.80), second suction (MD 24.80, 95% CI 14.80, 34.80) and at 120 seconds after the second suction (MD 29.10, 95% CI 14.96, 43.24). Episodes of hyperoxia were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Recovery time (Outcome 01.07):</B>
<BR/>Recovery time (time taken to return to baseline oxygenation status) was shorter than in the group not receiving preoxygenation (MD -2.12 minutes, 95% CI -3.82, -0.42).</P>
<P>
<B>Bradycardia (Outcome 01.08):</B>
<BR/>No episodes of bradycardia were experienced by infants during the suction procedure in either of the study groups. </P>
<P>Due to insufficient data, this review was unable to assess the effects of preoxygenation on other important outcomes (retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, hyperoxia, blood pressure) or on specified subgroups (gestational age groups, acute or chronic neonatal respiratory failure, use of different suctioning techniques)</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-19 14:06:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although this review shows some benefit in terms of oxygenation status at the time of suction, these results should be interpreted with caution as the only eligible study had major limitations. The limitations include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the small number of infants studied in the single included trial</LI>
<LI>limited generalisability - the included study was published 14 years ago</LI>
<LI>poor quality of the included study</LI>
<LI>limited short-term and no long-term outcomes assessed</LI>
</OL>
<P>The suction procedure used in this trial involved two minutes of chest vibration using a hand held vibrator, instillation of normal saline into the endotracheal tube and disconnection of the ventilator circuit. This regimen for endotracheal suctioning is no longer considered routine practice in many neonatal intensive care units.</P>
<P>There have been many changes in clinical care since the trial included in this review was undertaken. Many of these changes may render the results of this review redundant and difficult to generalize to today's population of ventilated infants. Changes in neonatal care over this time include the use of humidification, exogenous surfactant, physiotherapy, new ventilation modes and a move towards individualised rather than routine care procedures including endotracheal suctioning.</P>
<P>The use of systems that enable delivery of some ventilatory support during suction (usually by an adapter allowing suctioning without disconnection from the ventilator) are now widely available for use in most countries. In this review, subgroup analysis of disconnection from the ventilator could not be undertaken due to insufficient data. The effects of tracheal suctioning without disconnection in intubated ventilated neonates are addressed as the primary objective in another Cochrane Neonatal Review (<LINK REF="REF-Woodgate-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodgate 2002</LINK>). The effects of other techniques used with preoxygenation for endotracheal suctioning were also not able to be assessed in this review. These techniques include the use of saline instillation, one or two operators, use of manual ventilation, and use of chest wall vibration or percussion.</P>
<P>This review demonstrates benefit in terms of hypoxemia at the time of endotracheal suctioning with preoxygenation. Hypoxemia and its relationship with other alterations in systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes during endotracheal suctioning may place the preterm infant at risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and possible long-term sequelae. The potentially serious side effects of hyperoxemia which may be associated with the technique of preoxygenation is of concern and could not be addressed in this review. The cross-over design of this study precludes the meaningful exploration of long-term outcomes. As the population of infants included in this review may differ substantially from today's intensive care nursery populations, the generalisability of these findings is somewhat limited. The decision whether or not to use preoxygenation for tracheal suctioning in preterm ventilated infants cannot be adequately answered by this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review does not provide sufficient evidence on which to base practice. Although the results of this review indicate preoxygenation decreases hypoxemia at the time of suctioning, the relationship of this short-term outcome to clinically relevant longer-term outcomes could not to be assessed. Furthermore, the small numbers of infants studied and concerns about generalisability and methodological quality of the included study prohibits valid implications for practice. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies investigating the role of preoxygenation for endotracheal suctioning in the care of mechanically ventilated infants and the different methods used need to be undertaken. These studies should also consider the effect of other techniques for endotracheal suctioning such as the use of normal saline instillation, the frequency of suctioning, the use of closed suction techniques and the use of chest wall vibrations. Participants in these studies must be representative of the current population of ventilated newborns and enable adequate assessment of the effects on preterm infants, particularly the extremely low birthweight population. Future studies should use a randomised controlled trial methodology and be designed appropriately to adequately assess clinically important differences in short and long term outcomes such as hyperoxia, hypoxia, retinopathy of prematurity, cerebral cystic lesions, intraventricular haemorrhage, and developmental outcomes.</P>

<P>González-Cabello and coworkers investigated the usefulness of hyperoxia and/or hyperventilation as antihypoxemic maneuvers before tracheal aspiration in newborn infants. The study was a prospective, randomized, multiple crossover study conducted in the NICU of a pediatric hospital in Mexico City. Method of allocation to "antihypoxemic" maneuvers is unclear.</P>

<P>Within a 12-hr period, every patient received, in random order, three &#8220;antihypoxemic&#8221; maneuvers during 1 minute prior to tracheal aspiration: hyperoxia (10% increase of baseline FiO2), hyperventilation (50% increase of ventilator cycling rate), or both. Additionally, a control (sham) maneuver was also applied. </P>
