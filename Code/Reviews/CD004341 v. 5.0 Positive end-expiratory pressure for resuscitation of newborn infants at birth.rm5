<P>At birth, the lungs of newborn babies are filled with fluid. This fluid must be cleared and replaced with air after birth. While most babies manage by themselves, one in every 20 to 30 newborns receives resuscitation at birth, mostly for absent or ineffective breathing. All babies who are resuscitated receive help to breathe and this is the most important part of neonatal resuscitation. A variety of devices are used to help babies begin their normal breathing. Some of these devices allow the caregivers to give a &#8216;background pressure&#8217; known as positive end-expiratory pressure, or PEEP, which may help keep the lungs inflated. Currently, there are only two trials which address this issue. Although there were some benefits associated with using PEEP, there is insufficient information to make this a routine part of practice.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Effective ventilation is the key to successful neonatal resuscitation. Positive pressure ventilation is initiated with manual ventilation devices which may or not deliver positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). PEEP is known to have beneficial effects in preterm animal models and its use is ubiquitous in mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether the use of PEEP during positive pressure ventilation at neonatal resuscitation reduces mortality or morbidity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Pub Med (1966 to May 2004) was searched using the MeSH headings Infant, Newborn, Resuscitation, Positive Pressure Respiration and the text words Positive End-Expiratory Pressure or PEEP. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004) was searched using text words Newborn and Resuscitation. No language restrictions were applied. The abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research and the European Society for Pediatric Research, were searched from 1995-May 2004. Abstracts were also searched in Anaesthesiology, Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia, British Journal of Anaesthesia, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care and Anaesthesia and Analgesia. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ventilation devices providing PEEP with those not providing PEEP in the resuscitation of infants at birth.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Assessment of methodology regarding blinding of randomisation, intervention and outcome measurements as well as completeness of follow-up was planned. We planned to evaluate the treatment effect using a fixed effects model using relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction, risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) for categorical data and using mean, standard deviation and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data. We planned an evaluation of heterogeneity to help determine the suitability of pooling results.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were found meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of PEEP during positive pressure ventilation at neonatal resuscitation. Randomised clinical trials comparing positive pressure ventilation with and without PEEP at neonatal resuscitation are warranted.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A small but important proportion (3 to 5%) of newborn babies require resuscitation at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 1998</LINK>). Problems may begin primarily in the mother, the placenta or the fetus but present in the infant as ineffective or absent breathing efforts immediately after birth. If uncorrected, lack of oxygen and acidosis occur and eventually lead to damage of vital organs. The mainstay of resuscitation is oxygenation of the vital organs through the provision of assisted breathing, i.e. ventilation. Ventilation may be delivered via a face mask or an endotracheal tube. The choice of interface depends on the experience of the operator and the severity of the infant's condition. Though ventilation of these babies is the most important aspect of their care, at present little evidence exists to guide clinicians how best to provide ventilatory support. Since intubation and positive pressure ventilation were first recommended in 1928, a pattern of resuscitation has evolved based on extrapolation and assumption rather than on clinical measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Milner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milner 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>A role for positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in resuscitation?<BR/>A range of devices are available to provide assisted ventilation in the delivery room. Some provide no PEEP (e.g. Laerdal self inflating bag); some provide variable but measured PEEP (e.g. flow inflating or anaesthesia bags) and some provide a predetermined and measured level of PEEP (e.g. the Neopuff Infant Resuscitator). PEEP may be delivered to babies resuscitated with a face mask or with an endotracheal tube. The function of PEEP is to keep the lungs of ventilated infants partially expanded at the end of expiration, thereby preventing their complete deflation. PEEP is important for establishing and maintaining functional residual capacity (FRC) (<LINK REF="REF-Vilstrup-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilstrup 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thome-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thome 1998</LINK>). In preterm infants there is a strong association between absence of FRC and subsequent hyaline membrane disease requiring ventilation (Upton 1991). In very preterm lambs, the application of PEEP during resuscitation halves the oxygen requirements within ten minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Probyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probyn 2002</LINK>). The use of PEEP from the initiation of ventilation has been shown to reduce hyaline membrane formation (<LINK REF="REF-Argiras-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argiras 1987</LINK>), preserve surfactant function (<LINK REF="REF-Michna-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michna 1999</LINK>) and reduce the expression of inflammatory markers (<LINK REF="REF-Naik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naik 2001</LINK>) in the lungs of preterm animal models. <LINK REF="REF-Probyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probyn 2002</LINK> found that responses of a lamb model varied according to the level of PEEP, with optimal oxygenation without adverse effects being seen at cm water. If PEEP were provided during resuscitation of human infants this may lead to more rapid correction of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and less damage to the lungs, particularly in preterm infants. </P>
<P>While PEEP is always used during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in the intensive care setting, there are no current recommendations about the use of PEEP in resuscitation of the newborn. Twelve years ago it was noted that it is "possible that a resuscitation device that delivered positive end expiratory pressure would be of benefit to preterm infants &#8230; such a device would certainly warrant serious investigation" (Upton 1991). </P>
<P>Current international recommendations on the resuscitation of newborn infants outline the central role of IPPV and describe the use of self-inflating and flow-inflating bags at resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-ILCOR-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILCOR 2000</LINK>). They make no mention of other resuscitation devices nor recommendation regarding the use of PEEP during neonatal resuscitation.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>In newly born infants receiving resuscitation with intermittent positive pressure ventilation, does resuscitation using devices providing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) compared to devices not providing PEEP reduce mortality and morbidity?</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No studies were found meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review</P>
<P>Excluded study<BR/>A case series of 30 infants resuscitated using a rebreathing (i.e. flow-inflating (anaesthesia) bag) which provided PEEP was described by Upton 1991. Comparisons were made by the investigators between this group and historical controls they had previously resuscitated using a self-inflating bag. PEEP appeared beneficial in establishing a functional residual capacity (FRC). In the 22 preterm infants studied, a strong association between absence of FRC and the development of hyaline membrane disease requiring ventilation was noted. This study was excluded because there were no contemporaneous controls and no randomisation.</P>
<P>Study awaiting assessment<BR/>A study comparing resuscitation with end-expiratory pressure versus resuscitation without end-expiratory pressure was performed by Finer 2003 as a pilot for a larger study comparing respiratory support using continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) to intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for extremely preterm infants at delivery. All infants were resuscitated using a T-piece device which could deliver PEEP. Infants were only to be intubated for resuscitation; no infants were intubated for surfactant administration. Infants were randomised to receive end-expiratory pressure at resuscitation - i.e. CPAP by face mask, or IPPV with PEEP via a face mask or endotracheal tube (ETT) - or no end-expiratory pressure - i.e. free-flow oxygen or IPPV without PEEP via a face mask or ETT. A full report of this study is awaited.<BR/> </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We found no randomised controlled trials addressing the use of PEEP during neonatal resuscitation, thus this systematic review does not establish whether its use reduces mortality and morbidity or results in harm. We conclude that the widespread use of PEEP in this context (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell_x0028_a_x0029_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell(a) 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell_x0028_b_x0029_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell(b) 2004</LINK>) is based only on evidence derived from animal models and observational studies. Future studies should enrol both term and preterm infants who require positive pressure ventilation for resuscitation at delivery. Suitable designs may include randomised comparisons of single manual ventilation devices with which PEEP may be delivered (e.g.. anaesthetic bags or T-pieces) used with and without PEEP. A more practical approach may be to compare devices which do not deliver PEEP (e.g. self-inflating bag) with ones which do. Important outcomes would include those specified in our criteria for considering studies for this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine the safety and efficacy of PEEP during positive pressure ventilation at neonatal resuscitation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although there exists biological plausibility for the use of PEEP and many clinicians are using devices providing PEEP to resuscitate newborn infants, randomised clinical trials comparing positive pressure ventilation with and without PEEP at neonatal resuscitation are warranted.</P>
