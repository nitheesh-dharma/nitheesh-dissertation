<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:08:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is associated with rapid loss of vision due to abnormal growth of blood vessels in the macula. Corticosteroids that reduce this growth of blood vessels have been tested for treatment of such vision loss. This review included three trials evaluating two different types of steroids, triamcinolone acetonide and anecortave acetate, for the treatment of neovascular AMD. The findings across the three trials, which included a total of 809 participants, were consistent with no evidence of benefit, in terms of preventing vision loss, with antiangiogenic steroids compared with placebo or photodynamic therapy. Based on available evidence, there is little benefit of steroids with anti-angiogenic properties in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.".

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) continues to be among the leading causes of blindness in the developed world. It is a degenerative disorder involving the central portion of the retina that is responsible for high-resolution visual acuity. The two major types of AMD are classified based on specific abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina. The dry, or atrophic, form of AMD typically involves the RPE, choriocapillaris, and photoreceptors in the absence of serous or hemorrhagic leakage. The wet, or neovascular, form includes choroidal neovascularization (CNV), leakage of blood and serum, and fibrovascular scarring. Because of the severity of disease found in the neovascular form, it accounts for the majority of significant vision loss caused by AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1984</LINK>). Treatment options for this disease are limited and there are a variety of therapies currently being investigated for neovascular AMD. This review is concerned with the potential use of intravitreal antiangiogenic steroids for the treatment of neovascular AMD. Another Cochrane review is looking at agents that are specific to anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF) (<LINK REF="REF-Vedula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vedula 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The World Health Organization estimates that at least eight million individuals worldwide are severely visually impaired due to AMD (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). It is estimated that in the United States alone 1.6 million people aged 50 years and older have evidence of late AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 2002</LINK>). Large, population-based studies worldwide have found varying prevalence rates of AMD, though they have consistently shown increased risk with age (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, the Beaver Dam Eye Study found an increased incidence of age-related maculopathy lesions with age (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). With the growing aging population in the developed world, the number of people at risk of AMD is bound to increase further.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Individuals with atrophic AMD typically present with a slow and gradual deterioration in fine discriminate visual acuity, which may eventually lead to central vision loss. Neovascular AMD is associated with a more rapid loss of vision. With CNV and leakage of fluid into the surrounding retina, central blurring or visual distortion occurs. Eventual scarring and extensive leakage can subsequently lead to more significant loss of vision.</P>
<P>Fundus examination of people with AMD reveals characteristic presentations that range from drusen and pigmentary changes in people with the atrophic form, to subretinal fluid or blood in the neovascular form. In neovascular AMD, fluorescein angiography is helpful in detecting subtle exudates associated with CNV. Based on fluorescein studies, CNV can be classified as classic or occult lesions. Classic lesions are characteristically well-defined and have early hyperfluorescence, whereas occult lesions have late leakage or evidence of fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment.</P>

<P>The Macular Photocoagulation Studies (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1994</LINK>) demonstrated a delay in vision loss after laser photocoagulation treatment for extrafoveal and juxtafoveal classic CNV secondary to AMD. Argon thermal laser photocoagulation of CNV is not an option for subfoveal CNV as it causes immediate loss of central vision due to damage to the overlying retina. Recurrence of CNV following thermal laser has been shown to occur within three years (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1994</LINK>). A Cochrane review summarizes the evidence on laser photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Virgili-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgili 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed as an alternative non-thermal treatment for subfoveal CNV. In PDT, a photoreactive drug is used and activated with light to induce release of free radicals as the drug fills the proliferative neovascularization. The Treatment of AMD with PDT (TAP) Study Group demonstrated a reduced risk of visual loss for eyes with predominantly classic CNV after PDT treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bressler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bressler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1999</LINK>). However, most participants receiving PDT need multiple treatments within the first year. Recent fluorescein angiographic guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of subfoveal CNV describe patients who are most likely to benefit from PDT with verteporfin (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VIP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2003</LINK>). A recently updated systematic review on PDT for AMD is also published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Cochrane reviews have also been published on other interventions such as antiangiogenic therapy with interferon alfa (<LINK REF="REF-Reddy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 2006</LINK>), radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2010</LINK>), antioxidants (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2012</LINK>) and ginkgo biloba (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-19 20:44:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Clinical and basic science research has directed attention to angiogenesis as a key target for the medical treatment of CNV. Several antiangiogenic agents are being investigated in treating neovascular AMD and other pathologic neovascularization of ocular tissues (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Intravitreal injection of pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab have been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CNV in patients with AMD. Inflammatory processes have also been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AMD and development of CNV (<LINK REF="REF-Penfold-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penfold 2001</LINK>). Given these potential pharmacologic targets for inducing regression of CNV, steroids have been investigated for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects.</P>
<P>Penfold et al reviewed laboratory evidence demonstrating that intravitreal corticosteroids mediate anti-inflammatory responses by inducing the resorption of exudates and down-regulating inflammatory stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Penfold-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penfold 2001</LINK>). Angiostatic steroids are a separate class of steroids that mediate specific antiangiogenic activity independent of steroid hormone activity. Angiostatic steroids have been shown to inhibit neovascularization in intraocular tumors in animals (<LINK REF="REF-BenEzra-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BenEzra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penfold-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penfold 2001</LINK>). These steroids are believed to inhibit angiogenesis by increasing the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor, which subsequently inhibits plasmin generation, a process essential to the invasive growth of new vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Blei-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blei 1993</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-19 20:45:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>With the support of laboratory evidence and advances in drug delivery systems, intravitreal steroids have been studied and used for the treatment of neovascular AMD in the clinical setting. However, the classes of steroids, dosages, and drug delivery systems being used vary between clinical studies. The diversity in methodology warrants a review of these trials to help draw meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness and relevance of steroids in the management of neovascular AMD.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-15 11:01:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

A secondary aim of this review is to compare the clinical outcomes and side effects of different antiangiogenic steroids. A third aim is to compare the intraocular drug delivery systems used for the administration of steroids in the treatment of neovascular AMD in different clinical trials.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the studies that met the inclusion criteria. The review authors were not masked to author or institution details of included trials during the assessment. We assessed the risk of bias according to the following domains: sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), masking of patients and study personnel (performance bias), masking of outcome assessors (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other sources of bias. We judged each risk of bias domain to be at 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' risk of bias as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Disagreements between review authors were resolved by discussion. We contacted trial authors for clarification of any risk of bias domain.</P>

<P>We planned to combine the data using a random-effects model if we found no substantial heterogeneity with a chi-square test and the I-square statistic. As more studies become available in the future, we will investigate any heterogeneity by examining study characteristics including: participant age, visual acuity, lesion size and composition, drug delivery system, type and dose of steroid used. We will use a fixed-effect model if there are fewer than three studies. Dichotomous outcome measures will be summarized as risk ratios.

<B>Types of participants</B>
<BR/>The Anecortave Acetate Clinical Study (<LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK>) was a multi-center trial conducted in 18 clinical centers across Europe and the United States. The trial enrolled 128 participants and only one eye per participant was randomized. Participants had known AMD and subfoveal CNV with a classic component, were 50 years or older, and had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/320.</P>
<P>The Intravitreal Triamcinolone Study (<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>) conducted in a single tertiary care hospital in Sydney, Australia, enrolled 151 participants who were 60 years or older with known AMD and found to have classic or discrete CNV, best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or better, and symptoms lasting no longer than 12 months prior to enrollment. The trial included 139 participants of which 12 had both eyes randomized to different interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK> was conducted among 530 participants in 52 centers across Europe, USA, Canada, Israel and Australia. Participants in this trial were at least 50 years old and had been diagnosed with neovascular AMD, subfoveal CNV eligible for treatment with PDT and with no history of prior treatment with PDT. The best-corrected visual acuity range for eligibility was 20/240 to 20/400. The study randomized 130 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Type of intervention<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK> investigated juxtascleral depot injection of an entirely different steroid, acetonide anecortave acetate at three different doses, 3 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg compared to placebo. A sterile posterior juxtascleral procedure, using a specially designed injecting cannula, was used to administer 0.5 ml of study medication or placebo (vehicle) onto the outer surface of the sclera near the macula.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK> examined the efficacy and safety of a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide (0.1 ml of Kenacort 40; Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals, Noble Park, Victoria, Australia). A placebo treatment consisting of a subconjunctival injection of isotonic sodium chloride solution was introduced after the 12th participant was enrolled, when it became apparent that participants allocated to no treatment were more likely to drop out of the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK> compared PDT with adjunct juxtascleral depot administration of 15 mg anecortave acetate versus PDT alone. Participants randomized to the anecortave acetate 15 mg group received a sham PDT treatment prior to the posterior juxtascleral depot, while the PDT group received a sham posterior juxtascleral depot procedure after the PDT treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcome measures</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK> evaluated the mean change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity as the primary outcome. Other vision outcomes included as percentage of participants with preservation or maintenance of vision (loss of &lt; 3 logMAR lines vision), clinically significant worsening of vision (loss of at least 3 lines vision), and severe vision loss (at least 30 logMAR letters or 6 lines). The trial also commented on changes in CNV lesion characteristics. Participants were clinically evaluated at post-injection day one to two, week two and six, month three and six after each posterior juxtascleral administration of treatment. Visual acuity was measured at all study visits except on post-injection day one to two. Fluorescein angiography and fundus photography was performed at week two and six, month three, prior to each additional retreatment and at the exit visit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK> reported the proportion that developed severe visual loss (30 letters on a logMAR chart) at two years as their primary outcome. Other vision outcomes reported include the risk ratio of loss of 3 or more lines of vision, and loss of 6 or more lines of vision at 12 months. Participant data was reviewed before treatment, then at three, six, and 12 months when visual acuity was measured. Fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline, and at three and 12 months, while stereocolor photographs of the macula were taken at baseline, and then at six and 12 months. Other outcomes reported include changes in size of CNV and leakage of neovascular membranes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK> assessed preservation of vision defined as loss of 3 or fewer logMAR lines of vision. The primary outcome measure was percentage of responders or participants losing fewer than 3 lines of vision at month 12. The follow up visits were scheduled for three, six, nine and 12 months. Digital fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography was done at all study visits and transmitted to a reading center for masked assessment.</P>

<P>Although the reports for <LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK> described that a randomization schedule was generated "by the biostatistics department at Alcon Research," it is unclear how the sequence was actually generated.

<P>Based on the description in the trial report, patients, investigators making a decision whether to re-treat the patient during a follow-up visit, and investigators evaluating outcomes were masked and unaware of participants' treatment assignments during the trial in <LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK>. Investigators administering study treatments to patients were unmasked to assignments. It is unclear from the trial report whether any pre-specified criteria were used by the masked ophthalmologist examining patients during follow-up and judging whether they would benefit from continued treatment or they should be excluded from the trial.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>, the first 12 patients randomized into the trial were randomized to either the study treatment or no treatment.

Subsequent patients were masked to treatment assignment as were investigators evaluating photographs. Although the report for <LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK> described that investigators measured visual acuity without considering the patient's medical history, it is possible that steroid-related side effects may have led to unmasking of the investigators.</P>

<P>For a large proportion of participants in <LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK>, outcome data were unavailable at 12 months follow-up. It appears that for all such patients, outcome data were imputed with the last available observation. The trial report described finding no significant differences at baseline between patients with and without missing data at 12-months follow-up. But it is unclear whether such differences could have been detected if they did exist. It is also unclear whether the assumption made when carrying forward the last available observation, i.e., the visual acuity early during the follow-up remains unchanged until the end of follow-up, is reasonable. In addition, analyses based on such an assumption ignore any associated uncertainty (<LINK REF="REF-NRC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRC 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Incomplete data was less of a problem for analyses of the primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>. Few eyes were excluded from analyses in each group.

<LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK> compared three different doses of anecortave acetate with placebo and reported visual acuity as both a dichotomous and continuous outcome. Data from this trial at 12 months included last observation carried forward for participants who were determined not to benefit with further treatment at six months by a masked investigator.</P>
<P>The risk ratio of loss of 3 or more lines at 12 months was 0.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.45) in the 3 mg group, 0.45 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.97) in the 15 mg group and 0.91 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.58) in the 30 mg anecortave acetate group all compared with placebo. The risk ratio of loss of 6 or more lines at 12 months was 0.8 (95% CI 0.30 to 2.12) in the 3 mg group, 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.99) in the 15 mg group and 0.65 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.83) in the 30 mg anecortave acetate group all compared with placebo. Although the 95% confidence interval for the 15 mg group alone excludes the null value suggesting treatment benefit in decreasing the risk of moderate and severe vision loss, it is nearly half in magnitude compared with the other two doses.

<BR/>The risk ratio of loss of 3 or more lines of vision at 12 months follow-up (figure not shown) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.29) in an available case analysis and 1.08 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.27) in an intention-to-treat analysis conducted using the last observation carried forward method. However, <LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK> was designed to be a non-inferiority trial. The investigators reported a primary outcome of preservation of visual acuity in terms of loss of fewer than 3 lines of vision at 12 months to compare anecortave acetate 15 mg versus PDT. The risk ratio of loss of fewer than 3 lines at 12 months was 1.08 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.29) only slightly favoring PDT over anecortave acetate.</P>
<P>In the subgroup analysis performed within the anecortave acetate group, there was a higher proportion of responders in the group treated with anecortave acetate 15 mg within the six-month treatment window and for whom reflux was controlled.

<I>Adverse effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>In the AACS trial, the most common adverse events included vision loss defined as loss of 4 or more lines of vision and cataract progression. This occurred in all four treatment groups. The only ocular adverse events that occurred more frequently in the anecortave acetate groups were "vision abnormalities" and foreign body sensation. There is no mention of any dose-dependent response for any of these ocular events.</P>
<P>The IVTS analyzed adverse events in 142 eyes at 12 months, 100 eyes at two years and in 35 eyes at three years (<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>). Procedure related events such as transient discomfort or blurring were reported in both groups. Elevated IOP, however, was noted in 31 participants in the treatment group and only in three participants in the placebo group at 12 months. One additional participant in each group developed increased IOP over the three year follow-up period.</P>
<P>There was significant progression of posterior subcapsular cataracts in eyes treated with intravitreal triamcinolone. After 12 months, five participants had progression of cataract by two or more Age-related Eye Disease Study Grades in the treatment group and only one participant in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>). In two years, eight participants in the treatment group compared to none in the placebo group developed progression of posterior subcapsular cataract. Other reported adverse events included arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in one participant in the treatment group and massive subretinal or break-through vitreous hemorrhage in three eyes in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK> evaluated safety data on participants who received at least one dose of anecortave acetate or PDT. The most frequently reported adverse event was vision loss as defined as a drop of 4 or more lines of vision. There was little difference between the participants treated with anecortave and PDT, with 31.9% and 30.4% having a decrease in vision respectively. Other adverse events were mostly unrelated to therapy except for one participant treated with anecortave acetate 15 mg who discontinued participation due to retinal artery occlusion, which is possibly related to the study drug.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-15 11:25:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Anupa to authors: With the way things work with publication of a stable review, we need to treat this update as a normal update and publish and then with the next issue we will then stabilize the review and put in the text below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through consultations with editors at the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group, we decided not to regularly update the review after the present revision. Instead, we will update the review if we become aware of any other eligible studies that we may have missed in our searches so far. The current standard of care for treating neovascular AMD has evolved with the introduction of several newer agents. The production and development of anecortave acetate has also ceased, making it unlikely that additional studies will be conducted using this drug. Our findings will be relevant, however, for investigators conducting network meta-analyses of interventions for AMD, as well as for investigators seeking alternate routes of administration for medications in the treatment of AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SV: OK, deleted paragraph specified above. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-11-15 11:25:10 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The available evidence scarcely supports the use of anti-angiogenic steroids for neovascular AMD. The effect estimates comparing steroids to placebo and steroids to PDT are small in magnitude and have large variances. We observed consistency across the three trials, which used different doses of two drugs, in the lack of a significant clinical or statistical effect of treatment. The interventions tested in the included trials comprised both a steroid with glucocorticoid activity (triamcinolone acetonide) and a steroid without glucocorticoid activity (anecortave acetate). Adverse effects anticipated with corticosteroids, such as cataract, occurred frequently.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-26 14:50:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Although we included three relatively small trials, descriptions in the individual studies indicate that they were adequately powered to detect meaningful effects of the interventions.The trials excluded individuals with other ocular pathologies in addition to AMD. However, because the eligibility criteria for the three trials were broad, we believe that our conclusions are applicable to most patients presenting with neovascular AMD.</P>

<P>Overall, the risk of bias for the three trials was moderate. Potential for selection bias was an important concern for <LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Slakter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Slakter 2006</LINK>.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-26 14:50:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Findings from numerous uncontrolled clinical trials in the past have suggested that there may be some benefit with intravitreal triamcinolone. A study by Challa et al showed that 18 months after triamcinolone treatment (4 mg) only 30% (6/20) of eyes with an initial visual acuity of 6/60 or better developed severe vision loss (<LINK REF="STD-Challa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Challa 1998</LINK>). In another case series by Ranson et al only one out of 11 (9%) eyes treated with intravitreal triamcinolone (4 mg) developed severe vision loss after one year (<LINK REF="STD-Ranson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ranson 2002</LINK>). However, given the lack of prospective controls and the small size of the previous trials, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the relative benefit of treatment versus observation alone.</P>
<P>The absence of evidence of benefit from a single dose of 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone as reported by IVTS investigators (<LINK REF="STD-IVTS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IVTS 2003</LINK>), suggests that the effects of intraocular steroid treatment is transient. <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2004</LINK> reported an increase in visual acuity in three out of six participants after a second injection of triamcinolone. Although findings from another case series suggested a potential benefit with using 25 mg triamcinolone (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2003</LINK>), such high doses raise concerns about increased incidence of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Prior randomized clinical trials provide evidence that participants with subfoveal CNV, such as those included in <LINK REF="STD-AACS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AACS 2003</LINK>, may benefit from PDT. Although trials evaluating combination interventions with steroids for neovascular AMD do not meet eligibility criteria for this review, we tabulate details from three relevant trials in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Arias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maberley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maberley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuchiya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuchiya 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is little evidence from the three RCTs included in this review to suggest that anti-angiogenic steroids are effective for neovascular AMD. Although the RCTs included in our review provide limited evidence of safety with surgical implantation of the intervention, they have demonstrated the utility of the route of administration.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-26 14:50:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering recent advances in treating AMD with other anti-angiogenic drugs, the relevance of future research on the effects of steroids is questionable. Future research on steroids should carefully evaluate the potential risk and lack of evidence of any benefit in the study design and while obtaining informed consent. Although some recent research has focused on comparing combination interventions of steroids and PDT with other interventions, the relevance of using steroids in such studies should be re-examined. Since the evidence suggests that steroids alone are not effective for neovascular AMD, it is unclear how a combination intervention with PDT can be superior. Studies evaluating combined interventions of steroids with other treatments such as PDT should be substantiated by adequate pharmacological and physiological rationale.</P>
<P>The consistent evidence from three trials included in our review also raise the question of why anti-angiogenic steroids did not result in clinically meaningful and statistically significant beneficial effects. Future research may examine reasons for discrepancies in the clinical effects between anti-angiogenic corticosteroids studied in trials included in this review and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor modalities.</P>
<P>We included one trial comparing steroids with PDT but we excluded trials evaluating combination interventions or staged treatment of exudative AMD with PDT forming a component of therapy. Combination interventions (anti-VEVG combined with photodynamic therapy and/or intravitreal steroids) are the subject of another planned Cochrane review.</P>
