<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong the transplanted kidney's survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation. This review aimed to evaluate the short and long-term benefits and harms of sirolimus and everolimus (TOR-I) when used in primary immunosuppressive regimens for kidney transplant recipients. Thirty three trials investigating the use of TOR-I in four different settings were evaluated in this review. No differences in the hard-end points of patient and graft survival were demonstrated for or against TOR-I in any comparison. Generally surrogate endpoints for graft survival favour TOR-I (lower risk of acute rejection and higher GFR) and surrogate endpoints for patient outcomes are worsened by TOR-I (bone marrow suppression, lipid disturbance). Long-term hard-endpoint data from methodologically robust randomised trials are still needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Target of rapamycin inhibitors (TOR-I) (sirolimus, everolimus) are immunosuppressive agents with a novel mode of action but an uncertain clinical role.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive regimens containing TOR-I when compared to other regimens as initial therapy for kidney transplant recipients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-June 2005), EMBASE (1980-June 2005), the specialised register of the Cochrane Renal Group (June 2005)., and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify relevant studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs where drug regimens containing TOR-I were compared to alternative drug regimens in the immediate post-transplant period were included, without age restriction, dosage or language of report.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-15 15:18:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Results are expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty three trials (142 reports) were included (sirolimus (27), everolimus (5), head-to-head (1)). When TOR-I replaced CNI there was no difference in acute rejection, but serum creatinine was lower (MD -18.31 &#956;mol/L, -30.96 to -5.67), and bone marrow more suppressed (leucopenia: RR 2.02 1.12 to 3.66; thrombocytopenia: RR 6.97 2.97 to 16.36; anaemia: RR 1.67, 1.27 to 2.20). When TOR-I replaced antimetabolites, acute rejection (RR 0.84, 0.71 to 0.99) and cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) (RR 0.49; 0.37 to 0.65) were reduced, but hypercholesterolaemia was increased (RR 1.65, 1.32 to 2.06). For low versus high-dose TOR-I, with equal CNI dose, rejection was increased (RR 1.23, 1.06 to 1.43) but calculated GFR higher (MD 4.27 mL/min, 1.12 to 7.41), and for low-dose TOR-I/standard-dose CNI versus higher-dose TOR-I/reduced CNI, acute rejection (RR 0.67, 0.52 to 0.88) and calculated GFR (MD -9.46 mL/min, -12.16 to -6.76) were reduced. There was no significant difference in mortality, graft loss or malignancy risk for TOR-I in any comparison.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>TOR-I have been evaluated in four different primary immunosuppressive algorithms; as replacement for CNI and for antimetabolites, in combination with CNI at low and high dose and with variable dose of CNI. Generally, surrogate endpoints for graft survival favour TOR-I (lower risk of acute rejection and higher GFR) and surrogate endpoints for patient outcomes are worsened by TOR-I (bone marrow suppression, lipid disturbance). Long-term hard-endpoint data from methodologically robust RCTs are still needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-15 15:19:56 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). In the developed world there are approximately 280 patients per million population (pmp) with a functioning kidney transplant, a figure which has increased throughout the 1990s. The transplant rate is around 30 pmp and between 30% to 40% of transplanted organs come from living donors. Graft survival beyond five years has remained unchanged since the 1970s, with an average annual decline of 5%. Waiting lists for transplantation continue to grow because demand exceeds organ availability. Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong kidney allograft survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKTSSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKTSSA 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Standard immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial induction and maintenance regimes to prevent rejection and short courses of more intensive immunosuppressive therapy to treat episodes of acute rejection. Most current immunosuppressive regimens in the immediate post-operative period typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T-cell activation or proliferation cascade which are central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (CNI e.g. ciclosporin, tacrolimus), antimetabolite agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone) with 93% recipients in the US, and 70% in Australia, being discharged from hospital after transplantation on these drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Chadban-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadban 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2004</LINK>). Following the introduction of CNIs (ciclosporin in the early 1980s, and tacrolimus in the 1990s), one-year graft survival improved to the current level of over 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Chadban-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadban 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2004</LINK>), but concomitant improvements in graft survival beyond 5 years have not occurred.</P>
<P>The major cause of long-term graft loss is chronic allograft nephropathy. This is a complex and multifactorial process characterised clinically by progressive deterioration in graft function, proteinuria and hypertension, and pathologically by changes in architecture and vasculature. Chronic allograft nephropathy is a consequence of immunological and non-immunological injury. Immunological factors include HLA matching, episodes of acute rejection and suboptimal immunosuppression. Important non-immunological factors implicated are donor organ characteristics, delayed graft function, recipient-related factors, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The acute and chronic toxicity of CNI has also been implicated; CNI are linked to nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and new-onset diabetes mellitus. To what extent recipient mortality and graft loss can be attributed to these adverse effects, or the cumulative impact of infection and rejection is unclear. Over the past decade, the introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs with novel mechanisms of action has substantially increased options for new strategies that produce adequate immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection while simultaneously reducing the side effects associated with CNI therapies. Target of rapamycin inhibitors (TOR-I) sirolimus and everolimus are among the newest agents introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Nashan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nashan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic produced from <I>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</I>. Everolimus is a derivative of sirolimus. Both bind to the same intracellular immunophilin as tacrolimus (FKBP12), but instead of inhibiting calcineurin, the drug-receptor complex then binds to proteins known as the "mammalian targets of rapamycin" (mTOR). This causes inhibition of a multifunctional serine-threonine kinase, preventing both DNA and protein synthesis resulting in arrest of the cell cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Dumont-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumont 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based upon laboratory data, the early expectation was that TOR-I would provide synergistic immunosuppression when combined with CNI (<LINK REF="REF-Schuurman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuurman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stepkowski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepkowski 1997</LINK>). The absence of nephrotoxicity in animal models increased expectations of significant clinical benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Viklicky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viklicky 2000</LINK>). Clinical studies dispelled some of the early optimism as synergistic nephrotoxicity was demonstrated when either sirolimus or everolimus were combined with ciclosporin (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan_x002d_301-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan-301 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDonald_x002d_302-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald-302 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitko_x002d_201-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vitko-201 2001</LINK>). Since then trials have been undertaken to explore strategies that avoid this interaction and clarify other potential benefits such as vascular protection (<LINK REF="REF-Ponticelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponticelli 2004</LINK>) and a reduction in malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Stallone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallone 2005</LINK>), and the impact of harms such as hyperlipidaemia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of key findings</HEADING>
<P>With 33 trials and over 7000 patients randomised, there is a substantial basis for informed decision making regarding the use of TOR-I as primary immunosuppression of kidney transplant recipients. Evaluating the effects of TOR-I is more complex than for most pharmaceuticals because the setting of kidney transplantation requires the simultaneous use of multiple immunosuppressive drugs which may also vary in dose, and because the clinical role of TOR-I has been uncertain as evident by its use in four different management algorithms. TOR-I have been considered as replacement for CNI, replacement for antimetabolites, and in combination with CNI at varying dose of CNI and TOR-I.</P>
<P>Two major patterns of results are evident. First, no differences in the hard-end points of patient and graft survival have been demonstrated for or against TOR-I in any comparison. Second, the relative effects of TOR-I on surrogate outcomes for patient and graft survival are favourable for some and not favourable for others. Hyperlipidaemia and bone marrow suppression are consistently more common in TOR-I treated patients, irrespective of outcome, but effects on graft function and acute rejection vary with the comparator. The use of TOR-I based immunosuppressive regimens will be determined by the clinical importance of these surrogates, which currently is uncertain. Given different factors underpin graft dysfunction, cardiovascular risk, CMV infection and bone marrow suppression, the benefit/harm trade-off of TOR-I use is likely to vary across different patient groups and appropriate TOR-I use will vary accordingly.</P>
<P>Compared with CNI, the immunosuppressive effects of TOR-I are not obviously different. The main differences are improved graft function, with a higher calculated GFR of around 15 mL/min at one year and less tremor. When TOR-I replaced antimetabolites, the risk of acute rejection was reduced by about 20%, and CMV infection by 51%, but calculated GFR was reduced by 8 mL/min.</P>
<P>When the optimum dose combinations of TOR-I and CNI were investigated, with standard CNI across trial arms, rejection risk was reduced by 23% when high dose TOR-I were compared with low dose, but calculated GFR was reduced by about 4 mL/min. When the dose of both TOR-I and CNI were varied across trial arms, to reduce synergistic nephrotoxicity, low dose TOR-I with standard dose CNI reduced rejection by 33% over higher dose TOR-I with reduced dose CNI, but also worsened calculated GFR by 10 mL/min. In combination with CNI, the composite effect of TOR-I on long-term graft function is determined by two competing risks with different causal pathways, increased immunosuppression reducing rejection with higher dose TOR-I/CNI and reduced graft nephropathy with lower dose TOR-I/CNI. The relative importance of each pathway remains unclear.</P>
<P>Whether TOR-I replaced CNI or antimetabolite, TOR-I patients had more lymphocoeles, bone marrow suppression and hyperlipidaemia, and the low dose/high dose TOR-I comparison confirmed disturbance of haematological and lipid indices were dose-dependent, with greater disturbance among the high dose TOR-I patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>The main strength of this systematic review is that it has identified and summarised a bewildering array of trials of TOR-I with heterogeneous intervention algorithms which have all reported their results within a short time frame (1999-2005). Additionally, where some trials' results have been reported many times in journals and at scientific meetings around the world, or their results combined and reported non-systematically, others have had much less publicity, with the result that most clinician's personal synthesis of the evidence available for TOR-I is likely to be distorted unless approached in a similarly systematic way. Our methodology was robust, including non-English language sources, unpublished data and assessment of trial quality (all of which are known to minimise potential biases) and by investigating sources of potential heterogeneity thoroughly (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). Because of the unusual heterogeneity of comparative algorithms, to avoid further complexity we did not include the additional trials where TOR-I have been investigated in post-primary 'switch therapy' maintenance or CNI minimisation immunosuppressive algorithms in this review</P>
<P>It is clear that TOR-I have beneficial therapeutic and detrimental toxicity profiles. None of the trial data currently available provides evidence for differences in patient or graft survival or morbidity from cardiovascular events or malignancy, since these differences are anticipated in the medium and long-term, not in the short term. The main limitation of this review is that of the contributory trials; data was limited beyond two years post-transplantation. Additionally, where graft-focussed outcomes were well reported, many of the potentially informative patient-focussed adverse outcomes were not reported, not defined, or inconsistently reported.</P>
<P>Transplant clinicians have become habituated to the use of surrogate outcomes as the primary outcomes in trial design, and which inform choice of agents for patient care. Consistent with most trials in kidney transplantation, the trials in this review also focussed on surrogate outcomes. Long-term 'hard' clinical outcomes in randomised trials, although clearly preferable, are time-consuming, and cost-prohibitive to adequately power trials around. Although evidence of a difference in outcome for a surrogate marker of patient or graft survival might reach statistical significance in meta-analysis, it should be recognised that this does not necessarily equate to the same difference in the longer-term outcome the surrogate seeks to inform.</P>
<P>Some surrogate outcomes are reasonably correlated with longer term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2004</LINK>), and the validity of others is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paraskevas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paraskevas 2003</LINK>). The validity of laboratory markers of bone marrow suppression and hyperlipidaemia induced by TOR-I is untested. Although 16 trials (48%) reported both thrombocytopenia and leucopaenia, none reported any patient-centred outcomes that might result from having low platelets (such as minor or major bleeding, requirement for transfusion etc), and frequency of infections other than CMV was not provided. The real harms of TOR-I induced thrombocytopenia and leucopaenia is unclear from trials, and registry and cohort data in this population is nonexistent, and case series data limited (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions </HEADING>
<P>TOR-I have been evaluated in four different primary immunosuppressive algorithms; as replacement for CNI and for antimetabolites, in combination with CNI at low and high dose and with variable dose of CNI. Generally surrogate endpoints for graft survival favour TOR-I (lower risk of acute rejection and higher GFR) and surrogate endpoints for patient outcomes are worsened by TOR-I (bone marrow suppression, lipid disturbance). Long-term hard-endpoint data from methodologically robust randomised trials are still needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-10-15 13:40:28 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to determine if there will be long-term benefits of TOR-I strategies there are two possibilities; modelling differences in surrogate markers, such as early GFR, to predict long-term results, or to continue the long-term follow-up of trials to five years and beyond. Both strategies are problematic, as the former relies on a fixed relationship between short and long-term outcomes irrespective of drug treatment or other events and the latter relies on low drop-out and contamination rates and a significant commitment of both time and finance to coordinate patients, data and methodologically rigorous intention-to-treat (rather than 'on treatment') analyses.</P>
<P>In the absence of long-term data, we are limited to summarising the expected differences in the surrogate outcomes we have examined and present these in (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We explicitly recognise the flaw in the a priori assumption of correlation of these surrogates with longer term outcomes which underpins the calculation of these estimates, but would suggest that they are also the flaws inexplicitly presented to a reader by the use and reporting of these same surrogate outcomes in the 33 randomised trials we have analysed.</P>
<P>There is no other previously published work that systematically reviews TOR-I used as primary therapy in kidney transplant recipients. There are two other recently published systematic reviews covering TOR-I use in kidney transplant recipients; one was limited to trials of planned CNI withdrawal from sirolimus-based therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mulay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulay 2005</LINK>) and so did not examine trials of primary therapy, and <LINK REF="REF-Woodroffe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodroffe 2005</LINK> examined sirolimus only, identified five trials (where we found 17), and subsequently excluded three on the basis of dosage investigated, leaving two trials of differing intervention algorithms, and so could reach no conclusions beyond the trials' individual results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-15 13:40:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the need for the follow-up of clinical trials in transplantation to extend well beyond the short term to five years and further. That this is possible in the field of kidney transplantation has been previously demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2004</LINK>) where a coordinated effort between trial investigators and a registry extended patient follow-up to 15 years post-transplantation. Requirement from drug licensing agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration to prolong trial duration is a helpful structural measure to encourage this practice.</P>
<P>Additionally, registry data should be examined to better inform modelling of the results of surrogate outcomes that RCTs have provided. Although informative registry analyses exist (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meier_x002d_Kriesche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier-Kriesche 2005</LINK>) they have yet to provide estimates of risk applicable to the size of difference in outcomes that RCTs are powered to or likely to detect. For example, we found an average serum creatinine of 128 µmol/L compared to 146 µmol/L (MD 18.31 µmol/L) for recipients of TOR-I versus CNI at one year, but registry data typically expresses estimates of risk of long-term graft loss per 88.4 µmol/L (1 mg/dL) increase in creatinine at one year (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Applicability in clinical practice; projected numbers of transplant recipients with at least one episode of acute rejection, requiring statin therapy, developing CMV disease and average differences in GFR within 2 years of transplantation per hundred patients treated with TOR-I<BR/>* calculated as absolute risk reduction/increase per 100 people treated with TOR-I (or low dose TOR-I) using summary rate in control (comparator) arms of trials compared to that in the investigative (TOR-I or lower dose TOR-I) arms of trials. 'ns' = difference not statistically significant (i.e. summary RR confidence intervals cross 1.00).<BR/># NNT = number needed to be treated with TOR-I or lower dose TOR-I to cause 1 person to experience difference in the direction noted.
