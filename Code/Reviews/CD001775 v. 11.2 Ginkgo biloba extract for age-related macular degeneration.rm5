<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-27 15:47:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition affecting the central area of the retina (the back of the eye). The retina can deteriorate with age and some people get lesions that lead to loss of central vision. Gingko biloba, extracted from the leaves of the maidenhair tree, is used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat a variety of medical conditions, in particular circulatory problems. Ginkgo biloba extract contains two constituents (flavonoids and terpenoids) which have antioxidant properties. It is believed these may help to slow down the progression of AMD. The author identified two small randomised controlled studies (with a total of 119 participants); one in France and one in Germany. One trial compared Gingko biloba to placebo and the other compared two different doses of the extract. Although both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision, the trials were small and of short duration. Adverse effects and quality of life were not assessed. The overall conclusion of this review is that current research has not answered the question as to whether Ginkgo biloba is of benefit to people with AMD. Future trials need to include a larger number of participants and be conducted over a longer time.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-27 15:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two published trials were identified that randomised a total of 119 people. In one study conducted in France, 20 people were randomly allocated to Gingko biloba extract EGb 761 80 mg twice daily or placebo. In the other study conducted in Germany, 99 people were randomly allocated to two different doses of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 (240 mg per day and 60 mg per day). Treatment duration in both studies was six months. Both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision however their results could not be pooled. Adverse effects and quality of life for people with AMD were not reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-27 15:42:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question as to whether people with AMD should take Ginkgo biloba extract to prevent progression of the disease has not been answered by research to date. Two small trials have suggested possible benefit of Gingko biloba on vision and further trials are warranted. Ginkgo biloba is widely used in China, Germany, and France. Future trials should be larger, and last longer, in order to provide a more robust measure of the effect of Gingko biloba extract on AMD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-10 22:34:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-10 22:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Age-related macular degeneration is a disease affecting the central area of the retina (the macula). In the early stages of the disease, lipid material accumulates in deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium. These deposits are known as drusen and can be seen as pale yellow spots on the retina. The pigment of the retinal epithelium may become disturbed with areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. In the later stages of the disease, the retinal pigment epithelium may atrophy completely. This loss can occur in small focal areas or it can be widespread (geographic). In some cases, new blood vessels grow under the retinal pigment epithelium and occasionally into the subretinal space (exudative or neovascular AMD). Haemorrhage can occur, which often results in increased scarring of the retina.</P>
<P>The early stages of the disease are in general asymptomatic. In the later stages there may be considerable distortion of vision and complete loss of visual function, particularly in the central area of vision. Population-based studies suggest that, in people 75 years and older, approximately 30% have early signs of the disease and 7% have late stage disease (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1992</LINK>). It is the most common cause of blindness and visual impairment in industrialised countries. For example, in the UK over 30,000 people are registered as blind or partially sighted annually, half of whom have lost their vision due to macular degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1996</LINK>). Currently there is no treatment which can restore vision in AMD.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-10 22:32:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of extracts from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba (maidenhair tree) for medical purposes originated in China; the extracts are commonly prescribed in Germany and France (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1992</LINK>). There are two main extracts that have similar constituents: EGb 761, which consists of 24% ginkgo-flavone glycosides and 6% terpenoids; and LI1370, which has 25% ginkgo-flavone glycosides and 6% terpenoids.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-01-15 13:50:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Ginkgo is used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and 'cerebral insufficiency'. It is thought to have several potential mechanisms of action:</P>
<P>1. increased blood flow;<BR/>2. platelet activating factor antagonism;<BR/>3. prevention of membrane damage caused by free radicals.</P>
<P>Vascular factors and oxidative damage are thought to be two potential mechanisms in the pathology of AMD. Animal studies suggest that EGb 761 protects mammalian retinal cells from damage (<LINK REF="REF-Droy_x002d_Lefaix-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droy-Lefaix 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Droy_x002d_Lefaix-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droy-Lefaix 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pritz_x002d_Hohmeier-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritz-Hohmeier 1994</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lebuisson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lebuisson 1986</LINK>: 10 people were included in each treatment group. Acuity (measured using a Snellen chart) improved in both groups during the six months of treatment but to a greater extent in the Ginkgo treated group. In the treatment group, average initial visual acuity was 3.8/10 (standard deviation (SD) 0.6/10). At the end of six months the average acuity was 6.1/10 (SD 0.8/10), an average improvement in vision of 2.3/10 (SD 0.7/10). In the placebo group, average initial visual acuity was 4.8/10 (SD 0.9/10). At the end of six months the average acuity was 5.4/10 (SD 1.06/10), an average improvement in vision of 0.6/10 (SD 0.7/10). This gives a mean difference of 1.7/10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.22).</P>
<P>Tests of association for near vision and visual field were stated to be not statistically significant. Clinical observation suggested that nine out of 10 people in the treatment group improved compared to two in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 4.5, 95% CI 1.28 to 15.81).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fies-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fies 2002</LINK>: 50 people were allocated to 240 mg/day and 49 people to 60 mg/day. Both groups improved in terms of visual acuity over the treatment period. There was no statistically significant difference in average visual acuity at the end of the study (mean difference in acuity at end of study 0.05, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.13). Greater numbers of the high dose group improved by 0.2 or more although this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.75).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-27 15:49:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials were identified that investigated the effect of Ginkgo biloba on AMD. Both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision. However, in both studies the visual acuity of participants improved in both treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>With only two relatively small trials reported, this review does not provide good systematic assessment of any potentially harmful effects of Gingko biloba. Adverse effects related to bleeding, such as subdural haematoma and hyphaema, have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenblatt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenblatt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowin 1996</LINK>). There have been several Cochrane reviews of Ginkgo biloba for other conditions which include a greater number of trials and, therefore, provide better evidence of any potential harms (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2005</LINK>). None of these reviews have identified serious major adverse effects associated with using Ginkgo biloba.</P>

<P>As Gingko biloba is a pharmaceutical treatment there is the potential to mask active treatment. However, Ginkgo biloba has a characteristic bitter taste that is difficult to mask (<LINK REF="REF-Knipschild-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knipschild 1998</LINK>). This issue was not considered in the placebo-controlled trial. Outcome assessors were not masked and the only clinical outcome reported did not have a clear case definition.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-27 15:43:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two small trials have suggested possible benefit of Gingko biloba on vision and further trials are warranted. Ginkgo biloba is widely used in China, Germany, and France. Future trials should be larger, and last longer, in order to provide a more robust measure of the effect on AMD. Care needs to be taken to provide a placebo control that has a similar bitter taste as the active ingredient.</P>
