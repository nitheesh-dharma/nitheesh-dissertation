<P>
<B>Review question: </B>This review compared intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an assisted reproduction procedure that places sperm directly into the uterus. Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) is a similar procedure that places sperm into the woman's fallopian tube, closer to the eggs than IUI. Both techniques aim to improve the chance of conception.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> The review included 16 randomised controlled trials (more than 1800 women) that compared these procedures for treating couples with non-tubal subfertility. Only three trials reported live birth. The evidence is current to September 2013. No trial reported its funding source, but one reported no conflict of interest, and one stated that it had received no commercial funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> No clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of couples with non-tubal subfertility. However, a high level of uncertainty due to lack of data is evident in the findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most outcomes, largely because of the small quantity of available data.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-05 23:49:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment for couples with subfertility that does not involve the fallopian tubes. It is used to bring the sperm close to the released oocyte. Another method of introducing sperm is fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP). Fallopian tube sperm perfusion ensures the presence of higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than does standard IUI. These treatments are often used in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-10-06 11:23:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted the data. If studies were sufficiently similar, data were combined using a fixed-effect model to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected. Studies that included participants with unexplained or mixed (non-tubal) subfertility were analysed separately from studies restricted to participants with mild or moderate male factor subfertility. The overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes was summarised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:26:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The review included 16 RCTs. Fourteen RCTs (1745 women) were included in the meta-analysis. Only three studies reported live birth per couple. No evidence of a statistically significant difference was noted between IUI and FSP in live birth (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.49, three RCTs, 633 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, 14 RCTs, 1745 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%, low-quality evidence). These findings suggest that for a couple with a 13% chance of live birth using FSP, the chance when using IUI will be between 8% and 19%; and that for a couple with a 19% chance of pregnancy using FSP, the chance of pregnancy when using IUI will be between 10% and 20%. Nor was evidence found of a statistically significant difference between IUI and FSP in per-pregnancy of multiple pregnancy (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07, eight RCTs, 197 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence), miscarriage (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.53, seven RCTs, 199 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence) or ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 6.88, four RCTs, 111 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, very low quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity was noted for the outcome of clinical pregnancy (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 54%), for which no clear explanation was provided.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:27:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:27:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is commonly offered to couples with types of subfertility not involving the fallopian tubes. Intrauterine insemination gained its popularity because it is a simple, non-invasive, cost-effective technique (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1306190923141038133469237087110&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Hughes-1997">Hughes 1997</A>). It is usually combined with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).</P>
<P>Studies on the dynamics of sperm transport have found a progressive decline in the number of spermatozoa along the length of the female reproductive tract. In normal fallopian tubes, a maximum of only 200 spermatozoa are present in the ampulla (<LINK REF="STD-Mamas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mamas 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ripps-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripps 1994</LINK> showed that the number of spermatozoa in the pouch of Douglas was very low after IUI. However, the number of spermatozoa could be significantly increased with utero-tubal flushes. On the other hand, some authors state that no correlation exists between the number of spermatozoa inseminated and subsequent pregnancy if at least one to five million spermatozoa are inseminated (<LINK REF="REF-Dodson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Weert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weert 2004</LINK>). With consideration of these observations, another simple non-invasive method was introduced, called <I>fallopian tube sperm perfusion</I>.</P>
<P>Traditional parameters for assessing the quality of human semen are the concentration, motility and morphology of sperm in the ejaculate. Reference values are based on observations in populations of healthy men, and absolute minimal values for each semen parameter are unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>). Since 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published reference values with cut-off points indicative of male subfertility. The 1997 WHO criteria for male subfertility required at least one of the following: sperm concentration (sperm count) less than 20 million per milliliter, total motility less than 50% or normal morphology less than 50% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>). Criteria have changed over time, with several revisions to these criteria, including changes in 1992, which reduced the cut-off for sperm morphology from 50% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). The 2010 WHO criteria include thresholds for sperm concentration of less than 15 million per milliliter, total motility less than 50% and normal morphology less than 4% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:04:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Semen (from the partner or the donor) is prepared to remove debris and to maximise the concentration of normal motile spermatozoa. Common methods of sperm preparation are the 'swim-up technique', whereby motile spermatozoa swim up into a culture medium, and the use of density gradients, which through centrifugation separate spermatozoa according to their density (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interuterine insemination involves placement of about 0.5 mL of inseminate into the uterine cavity, using a sterile, flexible catheter.</P>
<P>Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) is based on a pressure injection of 4 mL of sperm suspension while efforts are made to seal the cervix to prevent semen reflux. This ensures sperm flushing of the fallopian tubes and overflow of the inseminate into the pouch of Douglas (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1303272348101362978048494876256&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Fanchin-1995">Fanchin 1995</A>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:04:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>FSP was developed to promote higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than are provided with standard IUI.</P>
<P>However, a possible disadvantage of FSP is the large volume of inseminate, which may flush the ova out of the tubes or induce abnormal myosalpingeal contractions, resulting in expulsion of the ova from the tube and subsequent failure of fertilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Nuojua_x002d_Huttunen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nuojua-Huttunen 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:08:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of FSP with that of standard IUI, and variable findings have been reported. Some of these studies did not have enough power to detect statistically significant differences; therefore it seemed appropriate to consider pooling the results. The aim of this review was to determine whether outcomes in improving the probability of conception differ between FSP and IUI. As one of the basic requirements for IUI, and subsequently FSP, is the presence of patent tubes, we investigated the efficacy of FSP and IUI in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility.</P>

<P>An initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search was conducted by one review author (AEPC), and the full texts of all potentially eligible studies were retrieved. Four review authors (AEPC and MJH or CF or JM) independently selected the trials to be included according to the above-mentioned criteria. Disagreements were resolved through arbitration by a third review author (BJC). We corresponded with study investigators as required to clarify study eligibility.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies (AEPC and MJH; for the update CF and JM). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author. Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). When studies had multiple publications, the main trial report was used as the reference, and additional details were derived from secondary papers. When important information was missing from the original publications, attempts were made to contact the primary investigators.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:24:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org) to assess allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); blinding of participants, personnel and/or outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective reporting; and other potential sources of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in 'Risk of bias' tables. </P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:25:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All outcomes were dichotomous. We used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When data to calculate ORs were not available, we planned to utilise the most detailed numerical data available that might facilitate similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values)<I>. </I>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:27:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible, and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists. When these data were unobtainable, imputation of individual values was undertaken for the primary outcome only: Live births were assumed not to have occurred in participants without a reported outcome.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:29:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered whether clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by the measure of the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. An I<SUP>2</SUP> measurement greater than 50% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:31:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the review authors aimed to minimise the potential impact of such biases by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data. If ten or more studies were included in an analysis, we planned to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study effects (i.e. the tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-10-06 00:32:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If the studies were sufficiently similar, we combined them using a fixed-effect model to compare IUI versus FSP. An increase in the odds of a particular outcome, which might be beneficial (e.g. live birth) or detrimental (e.g. adverse effects), is displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line, and a decrease in the odds of a particular outcome is displayed to the left of the centre-line.  </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The mean or median duration of subfertility among participants in the included studies was about 3.5 years (range 2.0 to 4.4 years) in most studies.

Mean age of participants ranged from 29 to 36 years, where stated. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>), 24% of women had secondary subfertility.</P>
<P>The most common causes of subfertility in the included studies were unexplained infertility and male factor infertility.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:22:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare intrauterine insemination and fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility, with respect to live birth, clinical pregnancy and adverse effects. No good evidence suggested any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness or safety in treating non-tubal subfertility. Findings suggest that for a couple with a 13% chance of live birth using FSP, the chance when using IUI will be between 8% and 19%; and that for a couple with a 19% chance of pregnancy using FSP, the chance of pregnancy when using IUI will be between 10% and 20%.</P>
<P>The evidence was of low quality. Moreover, the analyses of pregnancy rates appeared underpowered, with some suggestion of benefit for FSP.</P>
<P>We concluded that currently no good evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their safety and effectiveness in treating non-tubal subfertility.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:28:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>A number of methodological considerations have to be considered when interpreting the results as clinical heterogeneity was noted in the included trials, as well as substantial statistical heterogeneity for the outcome of clinical pregnancy.</P>
<P>Types of subfertility differed between and within the trials and included unexplained subfertility, ovarian dysfunction, cervical factor, light peritubal adhesions, mild endometriosis and mild to moderate male factor subfertility.</P>
<P>Studies were similar with regard to mean participant age. Most studies excluded women over 39 years of age. Most fertility research centres have a maximum age of inclusion because of lower success rates with older women, related to lower ovarian reserve and oocyte quality in women over 40 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Bukman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bukman 2000</LINK>). The duration of subfertility was at least one year in all of the studies (where reported) and was commonly longer than three years. It is known that fertility treatment is less successful with longer duration of subfertility.</P>
<P>The method of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation used varied among the included studies. Previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>) have concluded that gonadotrophins are more effective than clomiphene citrate in the treatment of subfertile couples in IUI programmes. However, the largest included study (<LINK REF="REF-Dankert-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dankert 2007</LINK>) in <LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between CC and gonadotrophins. More aggressive ovarian stimulation is likely to increase pregnancy as well as multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS); this should be taken into account when study results are compared. In the current review, randomisation was done on the day of insemination after ovarian stimulation, so the ovarian stimulation method was unlikely to influence FSP and IUI outcomes.</P>
<P>Differing methods of sperm preparation were used and included both swim-up and gradient techniques. Use of a gradient might yield a higher recovery rate (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>), although a Cochrane review on recovery rates after different semen analysis techniques concluded that no semen preparation technique is superior to another (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Differing catheters were also used. Different types of IUI catheters have been compared in a Cochrane review (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=679099090611594407&amp;versionPK1=z1304071106449401893759080586874&amp;versionPK2=z1304090723391331362489688662057#REF-van-der-Poel-2010">van der Poel 2010</A>), but no specific conclusion could be made regarding the superiority of one catheter class over another.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-10-14 16:52:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most common problems involving the quality of studies in this review were failure to report live birth as an outcome and failure to describe an acceptable method of allocation concealment. Most studies described acceptable methods of sequence generation and were at low risk of attrition bias or other sources of bias. One study reported only per-cycle data. All studies were apparently unblinded, but this was considered unlikely to cause bias.</P>
<P>As noted above, some analyses appeared underpowered.</P>
<P>Publication bias appeared unlikely, as a funnel graph for the outcome of clinical pregnancy was symmetrical (see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using GRADE methods, the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for all outcomes apart from ectopic pregnancy, for which it was rated as very low. This was largely a result of the small quantity of data available, which resulted in wide confidence intervals that were compatible both with no effect and with appreciable benefit or harm. In addition, most studies did not describe their methods in adequate detail. For the outcome of clinical pregnancy, substantial heterogeneity was noted, which was not adequately explained by clinical differences between the studies.

<UL>
<LI>What was the duration of subfertility?</LI>
<LI>Were prognostic factors such as the age of the woman and the duration of subfertility considered?</LI>
<LI>Were female factors excluded or corrected? All women had to have regular menstrual cycles with biphasic body temperature charts or normal luteal progesterone; patent tubes on hysterosalpingography (HSG) or laparoscopy; no cervical factors, thus a positive post-coital test or normal cervical mucus with pH &gt; 6.3 and Insler score &gt; 11.</LI>
<LI>Had treatments been applied previously? Was it tubal surgery, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation without insemination, or other?</LI>

<UL>
<LI>What method of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) was used?</LI>
<LI>Were criteria to cancel the insemination because of the risk of multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (cancellation criteria) described?</LI>
<LI>Duration of treatment: How many treatment cycles were offered?</LI>
<LI>How many inseminations were performed per cycle?</LI>
<LI>What timing method was used in natural cycles: with luteinising hormone (LH) in blood or urine?</LI>
<LI>What timing method was used in cycles with COH. When no GnRHa was used: Was LH also measured in cycles with COH?</LI>
<LI>What was the actual timing of IUI or FSP? Was IUI or FSP in natural cycles performed 20 to 40 hours after the onset of the LH surge was detected, and in cycles with COH 35 to 45 hours after hCG?</LI>
<LI>Which semen was inseminated (donor semen or partner semen)?</LI>
<LI>What method of semen preparation was applied?</LI>
<LI>What were the semen characteristics before and after sperm processing (especially the number of motile spermatozoa that were inseminated)?</LI>
