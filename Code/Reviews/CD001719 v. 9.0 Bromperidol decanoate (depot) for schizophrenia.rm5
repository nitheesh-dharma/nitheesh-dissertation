<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-01 02:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bromperidol decanoate is used as a long-acting antipsychotic medication in at least Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. The preparation seems to be less potent than other depot antipsychotics (such as fluphenazine and haloperidol decanoate) and better than placebo injection. However, this older antipsychotic preparation has very few data from good quality studies and new trials are needed to fully understand the effects of this preparation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia. Long-acting depot injections of drugs such as bromperidol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of depot bromperidol versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-03 14:13:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2012 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2012).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-29 12:45:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought all randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot bromperidol, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations. Primary outcomes were clinically significant change in global function, service utilisation outcomes (hospital admission, days in hospital), relapse.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-11 14:05:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2011 update MP independently extracted data, CEA carried out the reliability check. We calculated fixed-effect risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). Analysis was by intention-to-treat.</P>
<P>For the 2012 update, data collection and analysis was not carried out as no new studies were found.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-03 14:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2012 search found no new studies, we have therefore included no new trials in this 2012 update. The number of included trials remain 4 RCTs, total n = 117. A single, small study of six months' duration compared bromperidol decanoate with placebo injection. Similar numbers left the study before completion (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.6) and there were no clear differences between bromperidol decanoate and placebo for a list of adverse effects (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR akathisia 2.0 CI 0.21 to 18.69, RR increased weight 3.0 CI 0.14 to 65.9, RR tremor 0.33 CI 0.04 to 2.69). When bromperidol decanoate was compared with fluphenazine depot, we found no important change on global outcome (n = 30, RR no clinical important improvement 1.50 CI 0.29 to 7.73). People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had fewer relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group more frequent than those taking other depot preparation due to any cause (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 2.17 CI 1.00 to 4.73). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-03 11:05:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well-conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-29 17:00:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-29 12:56:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder characterised by psychosis, apathy and social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships and leisure time (<LINK REF="REF-Mueser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueser 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of schizophrenia is 0.2-0.4 per 1000, with a lifetime prevalence (risk) about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1997</LINK>). It often runs a chronic course with acute exacerbations and often partial remissions. Antipsychotics are the primary medication for schizophrenia, with major effects on reduction of psychotic symptoms and prevention of relapses (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-29 16:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Aaes_x002d_Jorgensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaes-Jorgensen 1985</LINK>) but non-adherence is highly prevalent among schizophrenia patients, with at least one-third estimated to be non-adherent with their medication regimens (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). Those who suffer from long-term illnesses such as schizophrenia, where the treatments may have uncomfortable adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>) and where individuals have cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-David-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1994</LINK>) and erosion of insight, are especially prone to avoid taking medication on a regular basis. Depots mainly consist of an ester of the active drug held in an oily suspension. This is injected intramuscularly and is slowly released. Depots may be given every one to six weeks. Individuals may be maintained in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses, sometimes in clinics set up for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1994</LINK>). Evidence suggests that depot may improve outcomes compared with oral antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischhacker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischhacker 2009</LINK>), because medication intake is assured and because the doctor immediately knows when a patients stops treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2011</LINK>). Nevertheless in some countries, due to various reasons such as refusal by patients or reservations by psychiatrists, depot formulations are rarely prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Hamann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamann 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heres-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heres 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is one in a series focusing on the effects of depot preparations for those with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Abhijnhan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abhijnhan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-David-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 2005</LINK>). Bromperidol (R 11.333, azuren, 4-[4-(p-bromophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidino]-4'-fluorobutyro phenone, impromen, tesoprel, bromidol, bromperidol) belongs to the butyrophenone class of drugs (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-29 16:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bromperidol's depot preparation is a decanoate in sesame oil (bromidol depot, impromen decanoas). The pharmacokinetic composition of the drug is similar to that of haloperidol decanoate, a more frequently used depot (<LINK REF="REF-Someya-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Someya 1991</LINK>). It is a strong D2 and very weak D1 antagonist. It has incisive activity and no active metabolites. The slow release of the decanoate ester from the oily depot has an elimination half-life of about 28 days.</P>
<P>Bromperidol decanoate is available as 'Impromen' in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands and as 'Tesoprel' in Italy. How prevalent its use is has not been possible to ascertain. Janssen Cilag has already been helpful in supplying data and is attempting to identify data on prevalence of use. The reviewers would welcome information relating to use of this preparation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-29 17:00:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although most psychiatrists acknowledge a greater efficacy of depot with regard to relapse prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2010</LINK>), the depot formulations are seldom prescribed in the treatment of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Heres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heres 2006</LINK>) and evidence about depot preparations is unclear. While an early meta-analysis suggested a superiority of depot compared with oral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1994</LINK>), the Cochrane reviews of the various depots did not find any convincing difference (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2001</LINK>). The information on efficacy and tolerability of specific depot preparations, such as depot bromperidol decanoate, is now out of date and needs to be updated.</P>

<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If a trial is described as 'double blind' but implies randomisation, we included such trials in a sensitivity analysis (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>). If their inclusion did not result in a substantive difference, they remained in the analyses. If their inclusion did result in statistically significant differences, we did not add the data from these lower-quality studies to the results of the better trials, but presented such data within a subcategory. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by alternate days of the week. Where people were given additional treatments within the depot bromperidol or control group, we only included data if the adjunct treatment was evenly distributed between groups and it was only the depot bromperidol that was randomised.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING>
<P>For the 2011 version, MP extracted data from included studies. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible. When further information was necessary, we contacted authors of studies in order to obtain missing data or for clarification. If studies were multi-centre, where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre separately.</P>

<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we have noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We entered skewed data from studies of fewer than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we entered such data into syntheses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for depot bromperidol decanoate. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not improved') we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.8 Summary of findings table</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>) and used the <A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">GRADE</A> profiler to import data from Review Manager (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman">RevMan</A>) to create 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes we rated as important to patient-care and decision making. We selected the following main outcomes for inclusion in the summary of findings table.</P>
<P>1. Relapse<BR/>2. Hospital admission<BR/>3. Clinically significant response in global state - as defined by each of the studies<BR/>4. Quality of life<BR/>5. Adverse effects</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-11 14:08:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2011 version, MP worked independently by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This new set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>
<P>Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain additional information.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results, we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% CI using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/), taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, has been superseded by the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and calculations therein.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data are binary we simply added these and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - were used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes were to change when 'completer' data only were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formula do not apply, we would calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a confidence interval for I<SUP>2</SUP>). I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots are possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-06-29 21:44:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<P>If inconsistency was high, we have reported this. First, we investigated whether data had been entered correctly. Second, if data were correct, we visually inspected the graph and successively removed studies outside of the company of the rest to see if homogeneity was restored. For this review we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total weighting, we would present data. If not, then we did not pool data and discussed issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut-off, but we use prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.</P>

<P>a. Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>b. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>A rating scale to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour. Each symptom is rated 1-7 and, depending on the version, between a total of 18-24 symptoms are scored.</P>
<P>c. Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale - DOTES (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This adverse effect tool seems less of a scale, where the degree and severity of a symptom is recorded, and more of a checklist. The DOTES seems to record the presence or absence of a list of adverse effects.</P>
<P>d. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - HDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>)<BR/>A clinician-administered depression assessment scale that rates the severity of symptoms observed in depression such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss.</P>
<P>e. Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This scale assesses five symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. They are: affective blunting; alogia; avolition/apathy; anhedonia/asociality; and disturbance of attention.</P>
<P>f. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984</LINK>)<BR/>A scale designed to assess positive symptoms, principally those that occur in schizophrenia. It is intended to serve as a complementary instrument to the SANS. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior and positive formal thought disorder.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Search</HEADING>
<P>The 2011 update did not find new relevant trials to be included (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) and the 2012 search found no new studies. Currently, research on bromperidol decanoate does not seem to be active. Four trials are included in this Systematic Review: two of six months' duration and two of one year's duration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Strengths and weaknesses</HEADING>
<P>Although there is a danger of judging the past by standards of today, it does hold true that this review would be more comprehensive if reporting of the existing trials had been to a higher standard (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). It is clear that researchers invested considerable effort recording scale-derived outcomes, but poor reporting leaves much of these data impossible to include. The weakness of the review may be the paucity of data, but the strength is that it is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of this topic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison 1: bromperidol decanoate versus placebo depot injection</HEADING>
<P>Any study of 20 people would not have much power to highlight even dramatic differences between two groups. The trial included was not of high quality, thus opening the possibility of inclusion of considerable bias and over estimate of effects. It is difficult to comment on the bromperidol decanoate versus placebo comparison.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>Skewed data present a problem to the systematic reviewer. Data in this review are based only on 20 participants and are inappropriate to present in graphs (<LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK>). There is some suggestion that the 'active' depot does effect 'positive' symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>Assuming that leaving the study early is not a sign of a positive effect, it would seem that bromperidol decanoate may have some effects on mental state/behaviour. Again, numbers are very small and nothing is conclusive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK> found no clear difference between bromperidol and fluphenazine depots at six months for global outcomes (CGI, BPRS). For preventing relapse, bromperidol decanoate seemed less valuable than other depots, even when small numbers were randomised. This is consistent with findings that people given bromperidol decanoate seem to require additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, and leave studies (due to any cause) more frequently than those allocated other depots. These findings consistently cast doubt on the comparative efficacy of bromperidol decanoate, which may explain its limited clinical use. No differences were found in BPRS score between depot bromperidol and other agents.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>We found no clear differences between people taking bromperidol decanoate and other depot antipsychotic drugs.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For those with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>No convincing differences are evident when adverse effects of depot bromperidol and fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate are compared. This, of course, does not mean that real differences do not exist, as all data are derived from poorly reported small studies. When it comes to choosing between bromperidol decanoate and another depot, people with schizophrenia may wish to exercise their own judgement. They could ask to be randomised in order to help produce better evidence for the effects of bromperidol decanoate for schizophrenia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Currently, remarkably few and weak data exist on the effects of bromperidol decanoate. It may be better than a placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. These findings should be replicated and do not justify routine use of depot bromperidol. If, however, there are reasons not to use other depots, bromperidol decanoate might be a viable choice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers, policy makers and funders</HEADING>
<P>No data have emerged about economic outcomes and there are minimal trial-based data to inform those with power to make wide-ranging decisions on clinical policy, funding of medication or research. If bromperidol decanoate is a treatment option it would seem important to encourage appropriate research into the effects of this preparation.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>If the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>) had been anticipated by trialists, much more data would have been available from the trials already identified to inform practice. Both authors and editors would help to clarify methodology and ensure outcome data were more transparent and usable. Failure to comply produces loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or policy makers. The included trials failed to specify the process by which allocation to the intervention group was undertaken. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid, and importantly gives the assurance that selection bias is minimised. Well-described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. Moreover, it would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner which reflects association between intervention and outcome: for example, risk ratio, odds ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If P values are used, the exact value should be reported.</P>

<P>This review highlights the need for good, 'real world' clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1995</LINK>) to investigate the effects of using depot bromperidol for people with schizophrenia. This particular depot is far from adequately evaluated by modern standards. Few people have been randomised (n = 117), and the depot has not been compared with an oral antipsychotic. More trials are needed to assess clinical outcomes, social and cognitive functioning and adverse effects. Future studies should randomise people for whom prescribing a depot or not is a dilemma in a 'real world' care setting, and report outcomes such as hospitalisation as well as satisfaction with care and cost. We do realise that design of a full randomised trial takes great care and thought but, because we have considered the past studies in some detail, have some suggestions on how such a trial may be designed (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>fi1. Study selection<BR/>The principal reviewer (SQ) inspected all identified citations or studies. A randomly selected sample of 10% of all reports was re-inspected by AD in order to ensure selection was reliable. Where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion, or where there was still doubt, the full article was acquired for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, SQ and AD independently decided whether they met the review criteria. Where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion and when this was not possible further information was sought. These trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information. For the 2003 update, DW independently inspected citations from the search results and identified relevant abstracts. Full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria were obtained and inspected by DW. See <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> for summary of search efforts (Figure created 2011).</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>), by each reviewer. When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify into which category to allocate the trial, data were not entered and the trial was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review.</P>
<P>3. Data collection<BR/>Data from selected trials were independently extracted by SQ, AD and DW. When disputes arose, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and this outcome of the trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Incomplete data<BR/>Where more than 30% of those randomised were lost to follow-up by 6 months, or 50% by beyond that time, data were felt to be too prone to bias to use and were not reported.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous - yes/no - data<BR/>4.2.1 Statistics: For binary outcomes, for example 'admitted' or 'not admitted', we calculated a fixed effects relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Intention to treat: Data were presented on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. Those who were lost to follow up were all assumed to have the negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of relapse, those who were lost to follow up all relapsed.</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Intention-to-treat analyses versus analyses that only take into account those who completed the study: in the case of continuous data, it was supposed that in many cases an intention-to-treat analysis would not be available, so an analysis was presented on those who completed the study.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Rating scales: a wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. Continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>), the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, such data was tagged as 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>4.3.3 Normal distribution of data: mental health continuous data are often not normally distributed. Most statistics assume a normal distribution. To avoid including non-normally distributed data in the statistical analysis, the following criteria are applied to all data before inclusion:</P>
<P>a. Standard deviations and means were reported or derivable from data in the paper, or were obtainable from the authors.<BR/>b. When a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them.<BR/>c. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale end point data, which typically cannot have negative values. If end point data were not available, reviewers chose to use change data, because the statistics used in Metaview are rather robust towards skew.<BR/>d. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30-210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>4.3.4 Endpoint versus change data: endpoint scale-derived data are finite, ranging from one score to another. Change data are more problematic and for it the rule described above does not hold. Although most change scores are likely to be skewed, this cannot be proven so they were presented in MetaView. Where both endpoint and change were available for the same outcome, we presented the former in preference.</P>
<P>4.3.5 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes, a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again, a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>4.4 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Secondly, RevMan does not currently support meta-analytic pooling of clustered dichotomous data, even when these are correctly analysed by the authors of primary studies, since the 'design effect' (a statistical correction for clustering) cannot be incorporated.</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol - to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. Subsequent versions of this review will seek to contact first authors of studies to seek intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, then we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice from the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK. Dr Julian Higgins advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC]. Should the ICC not be reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where cluster studies were appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies was possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Test for inconsistency<BR/>Firstly, consideration of all the included studies within any comparison was undertaken to estimate clinical heterogeneity. Then visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented employing, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate included 75% this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Data were then re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, and results became more consistent, falling below 75% in the estimate, the studies were added to the main body trials. If using the random effects model did not make a difference and inconsistency remained high, data were not summated, but were presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>8. Tables and figures<BR/>Where possible, data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the treatment depots.</P>
