<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-05-09 05:46:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Can mass media campaigns (television, radio, newspapers, billboards and booklets) deter young people from starting to smoke?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-29 15:10:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Smoking is a modern-day epidemic, and preventing young people from taking up smoking remains a key health priority, since experimentation with smoking starts at an early age. One possible method of achieving this goal is through mass media, which have the potential to reach and modify the attitudes, knowledge and behaviour of a large proportion of the population.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Can mass media campaigns deter young people from taking up smoking?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found eight studies out of 1326 publications, covering 52,746 participants. One of these studies is new to this updated version of the review. The most recent search was conducted in June 2016. All studies were directed at youth younger than 25 years. Seven studies were conducted in the USA and one was conducted in Norway. The mass media method (e.g. television) and certain characteristics of those taking part (e.g. age), as well as the length of time followed up, differed between studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Three out of eight studies found that the intervention was effective in preventing smoking in youth. The remaining five studies did not detect an effect. Although there was some overlap in characteristics between both effective and ineffective programmes, effective campaigns tended to last longer (minimum 3 years) and were more intense (more contact time) for both school-based lessons (minimum eight lessons per grade) and media spots (minimum four weeks' duration across multiple media channels with between 167 and 350 TV and radio spots). Implementation of combined school-based components (e.g. school posters) and the use of repetitive media messages delivered by multiple channels (e.g. newspapers, radio, television) appeared to contribute to successful campaigns.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of studies in this review is limited, due to problems in reporting results and issues with study design. Studies varied in their design, the interventions they tested, and in the people they involved. Studies found mixed results. In particular, none of the studies reported blinding of groups and there were concerns around how the studies were allocated to intervention or control. It would therefore be unwise to offer firm conclusions based on the evidence in this review. Inclusion of only two studies from the last 10 years is concerning, particularly considering the rising use of social media among youth. More high-quality studies are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-05 02:35:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mass media interventions can be used as a way of delivering preventive health messages. They have the potential to reach and modify the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of a large proportion of the community.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:19:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To assess the effects of mass media interventions on preventing smoking in young people, and whether it can reduce smoking uptake among youth (under 25 years), improve smoking attitudes, intentions and knowledge, improve self-efficacy/self-esteem, and improve perceptions about smoking, including the choice to follow positive role models.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-16 12:21:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE and Embase in June 2016. This is an update of a review first published in 1998.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:05:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized trials, controlled trials without randomization and interrupted time-series studies that assessed the effect of mass media campaigns (defined as channels of communication such as television, radio, newspapers, social media, billboards, posters, leaflets or booklets intended to reach large numbers of people and which are not dependent on person-to-person contact) in influencing the smoking behaviour (either objective or self-reported) of young people under the age of 25 years. We define smoking behaviour as the presence or absence of tobacco smoking or other tobacco use, or both, and the frequency of tobacco use. Eligible comparators included education or no intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 12:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted information relating to the characteristics and the content of media interventions, participants, outcomes, methods of the study and risks of bias. We combined studies using qualitative narrative synthesis. We assessed the risks of bias for each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, alongside additional domains to account for the nature of the intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to outcomes using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-29 15:11:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified eight eligible studies reporting information about mass media smoking campaigns, one of which is new for this update. Seven of the studies used a controlled trial design and one an interrupted time-series analysis. Risks of bias were high across all included studies and there was considerable heterogeneity in study design, intervention and population being assessed.Three studies (n = 17,385), one of which compared a mass media intervention to no intervention and two of which evaluated mass media interventions as adjuncts to school-based interventions, found that the mass media interventions reduced the smoking behaviour of young people. The remaining five studies (n = 72,740) did not detect a significant effect on smoking behaviour. These included three studies comparing a mass media intervention to no intervention, one study evaluating a mass media intervention as an adjunct to a school-based intervention, and one interrupted time-series study of a social media intervention. The three campaigns which found a significant effect described their theoretical basis, used formative research in designing the campaign messages, and used message broadcast of reasonable intensity over extensive periods of time. However, some of the campaigns which did not detect an effect also exhibited these characteristics. Effective campaigns tended to last longer (minimum 3 years) and were more intense (more contact time) for both school-based lessons (minimum eight lessons per grade) and media spots (minimum four weeks' duration across multiple media channels with between 167 and 350 TV and radio spots). Implementation of combined school-based components (e.g. school posters) and the use of repetitive media messages delivered by multiple channels (e.g. newspapers, radio, television) appeared to contribute to successful campaigns.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:10:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Certainty about the effects of mass media campaigns on smoking behaviour in youth is very low, due to inconsistency between studies in both design and results, and due to methodological issues amongst the included studies. It would therefore be unwise to offer firm conclusions based on the evidence in this review. Methodologically rigorous studies investigating the effect of social media and novel forms of technology as part of tobacco prevention campaigns for youth are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 12:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Smoking is a modern-day epidemic (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2014</LINK>) and a major cause of premature death worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Jha-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shiels-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiels 2017</LINK>). Smoking tobacco is a risk factor for six of the eight leading causes of death in the world; namely, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischaemic heart disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory tract infection and tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2009</LINK>). As such, it remains one of the most important public health hazards (<LINK REF="REF-Jha-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lortet_x002d_Tieulent-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lortet-Tieulent 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thun-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thun 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exposure to smoke, whether through active or passive smoking, is especially concerning for children, and leads to both short-term and long-term health effects. Exposure to second- or third-hand smoke can lead to increased respiratory symptoms, diminished lung function and respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kum_x002d_Nji-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kum-Nji 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pattenden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattenden 2006</LINK>), as well as declines in cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>). For instance, youth who are exposed to smoke have an increased risk of developing asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gilliland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliland 2006</LINK>) and have a decline in cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance, with as little as one month's worth of exposure to passive smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2003</LINK>). When young people take up active smoking, typically during adolescence, the health effects on the respiratory system are thought to immediately worsen (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>) and adversely affect their health. For example, immediate neurological changes can be witnessed (<LINK REF="REF-Abreu_x002d_Villaca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abreu-Villaca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2007</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Mass media consist of any channel of communication that has the capacity to reach large numbers of people and therefore have the ability to achieve population-level change (<LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2010</LINK>). This type of media does not rely on person-to-person contact to achieve the intended goal. It covers a wide variety of channels and vehicles, including but not limited to television, radio, newspapers, flyers, pamphlets and even social media. An attractive aspect of mass media as an avenue for message delivery is that it has the potential to reach a large proportion of the population whilst being relatively low cost.</P>
<P>Mass media have been widely used to achieve population-wide developmental goals and affect particular outcomes such as education, migration and social capital (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrara-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrara 2015</LINK>). Examples of health-improvement campaigns disseminated at a population level can be found from as early as the 1700s (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2010</LINK>). The purpose of mass media health campaigns is to increase the prominence of particular health issues and to increase awareness of the potential problems resulting in favourable behavioural change (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 2004</LINK>). This helps to keep the health topic on the social and political agenda, whilst being a trigger for other interventions/initiatives and giving legitimacy to community programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Wellings-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellings 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:34:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Using mass media for health promotion relies on the ability of the platform to reach a large audience (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 2004</LINK>). The bigger the exposure, the more chance that its content is perceived and the desired effect reached. While this may sound relatively simple, the efficacy of mass media campaigns also relies on many other factors, including message type, specifics of exposure, the target group at hand, execution of the messages, as well as the specific theoretical foundation on which it is (ideally) built (<LINK REF="REF-Flay-1987c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flay 1987c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2003</LINK>). Failure to take these criteria sufficiently into account can lead to lower or even no effects, regardless of the exposure rate. The specific theoretical foundation (if any is used) can determine or guide the content of the above-mentioned criteria.</P>
<P>Mass media campaigns can either be directed at the individual level or can be focused on changing social norms in a greater proportion of society (<LINK REF="REF-Wellings-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellings 2000</LINK>). Many mass media campaigns have some sort of basis in social learning theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandura-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 2001</LINK>), regardless of whether they intend to do so or not, with a main focus on the use of role models to shape the behaviours of individuals. The aim of these campaigns is to let youth identify with the models and learn from them by replicating their attitudes or behaviours (positive model), or rejecting the behaviour (negative model). Other campaigns place more focus on risk perception and fear appeal in the construction of their campaign (<LINK REF="REF-Pechmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pechmann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witte-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witte 2000</LINK>). The rationale in these interventions is that an individual first needs to recognize a risk or threat before one can take the preventive measures associated with health improvement. More recently, mass media campaigns have been based on social marketing (<LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>), which uses commercial marketing techniques to create health behavioural change (<LINK REF="REF-Grier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grier 2005</LINK>). The focus of social marketing messages is on incentives for voluntary change, making sure that the perceived benefits of the health behaviour outweigh the perceived costs, thereby encouraging behaviour change.</P>
<P>Mass media campaigns can also stimulate interpersonal communication on important health topics, thereby indirectly influencing health behaviour rather than directly targeting it (<LINK REF="REF-Southwell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southwell 2007</LINK>). By creating interpersonal communication, the intervention can lead to changing social norms, which is dubbed 'the social diffusion model' (<LINK REF="REF-Wellings-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellings 2000</LINK>). Campaigns that centre on social diffusion aim to create a catalytic health promotion effect in society rather than specific behavioural changes in one individual.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The benefits of tobacco prevention on the health of the individual are well known (<LINK REF="REF-US-DHHS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">US DHHS 2012</LINK>). One Australian study found that a hypothetical 1% reduction in absolute smoking over 12 months (between 2001 and 2002) would have resulted in 1000 fewer hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and 350 fewer hospitalizations for stroke, producing a cost saving of over AUD 20.4 million in direct healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Hurley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurley 2005</LINK>). Addiction to nicotine usually begins during adolescence, and young people who start to smoke at an early age have more difficulty quitting in later years (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giovino-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giovino 1994</LINK>). Therefore, reducing the prevalence of tobacco use amongst adolescents remains a key public health priority (<LINK REF="REF-BMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMA 2008</LINK>). Evidence from Australia demonstrates the extent of the problem; each year approximately 15,000 Australians die from a lifetime of tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-Scollo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scollo 2015</LINK>). Despite the well-known morbidity and mortality consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2006</LINK>), these smokers are being replaced by 70,000 young Australians every year who are taking up the habit (<LINK REF="REF-Scollo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scollo 2015</LINK>). Experimentation with cigarettes has been reported to start early, with 19.1% of school students who had never smoked cigarettes indicating they were susceptible to starting to smoke during the next year (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2008</LINK>). The New Jersey Youth Tobacco Survey estimated that 90 million cigarettes, or 4.2 million packs of cigarettes were consumed by high-school students annually in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-UMDNJ-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UMDNJ 2007</LINK>). Smoking behaviour among adolescent girls is increasing over that of boys (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahalik-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahalik 2013</LINK>). Smoking prevalence in 1994 was 10% for boys and 13% for girls aged between 11 and 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1996</LINK>). However a 2006 survey in Scotland demonstrated that smoking prevalence amongst boys decreased from 29% to 12%, but the rate of decline for girls was significantly less, from 26% to 18% (<LINK REF="REF-BMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMA 2008</LINK>). This all points to the importance of targeting youth to limit the uptake of smoking.</P>
<P>At the end of the last century it was suggested that mass media were particularly appropriate for delivering anti-smoking messages to young people because of their engagement and interest in the media (<LINK REF="REF-US-DHHS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">US DHHS 1994</LINK>). On average, American children between the ages of eight and 18 are reported to spend seven-and-a- half hours a day using and interacting with media (<LINK REF="REF-Common-Sense-Media-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Common Sense Media 2012</LINK>). The mass media, particularly television, can influence a young person's perception of what constitutes the real world and acceptable social behaviour, and help to mould cultural norms and convey important and believable messages about the behaviours it depicts (<LINK REF="REF-Strasburger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasburger 1995</LINK>). While the media landscape has changed with the rise of the internet and new technologies over the past decade (e.g. smartphones and tablet devices), television remains the predominant form of media used by children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Strasburger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasburger 2013</LINK>), either watched by itself or playing in the background when performing other activities (<LINK REF="REF-Brasel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brasel 2011</LINK>). From this we can see that youth engagement with mass media has not diminished and indeed has increased over time.</P>
<P>A review by <LINK REF="REF-Kremers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremers 2004</LINK> argued that smoking prevention should aim at influencing the image of non-smoking (i.e. positively influencing the identity of non-smokers) by using mass media interventions and restrictive policies. Evidence is accruing that media campaigns designed around persuasive health messages to change social norms may be effective tools to obtain behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pechman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pechman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zucker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zucker 2000</LINK>). This has been described and supported further among adolescents and young people (<LINK REF="REF-Callery-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callery 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupersmidt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupersmidt 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macy 2012</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2017-05-16 13:48:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register of trials. This is derived from regular systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index (see <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> for search strategies and dates). Reports of trials of mass media interventions to prevent smoking uptake are identified as potentially relevant when new reports are added to the Register. As a check that all reports of mass media prevention studies had been identified, we searched MEDLINE and Embase using a combination of topic-related terms, age-limiting terms, and the tobacco and study design terms used for the main searches. Topic-related terms included the following; mass media, videotape recording, telecommunications, radio motion pictures, audiovisual aids, radio, television, television (TV), campaign, advertising. Full search strategies are given in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. The most recent search was conducted on the 2nd of June 2016.</P>
<P>Searches for the first version of this review covered a larger range of databases; we did not find that the scope of the other databases or their indexing terms helped to retrieve additional study reports. Databases and strategies for the original version of this review are listed in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. We also searched some communication journals individually through the Social Science Citation Index, but have not repeated this for the current update, as it did not yield additional studies in previous versions of the review.</P>
<P>The Register contains a variety of studies published in foreign languages. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language or publication date.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-21 10:47:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For this update, from the title, abstract, or descriptors, a combination of two review authors (from KC, FS, KS) reviewed all literature searches. We excluded all studies that were clearly not RCTs, controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or interrupted time-series or that clearly did not fit the inclusion criteria. We then independently reviewed all other citations in full text, assessing for inclusion based on study design, population, intervention and outcome.</P>
<P>We reached the decision not to attempt a quantitative synthesis of the study results by an a priori assessment of the large number of sources of possible heterogeneity amongst studies likely to be eligible. These include features of the programme under evaluation, such as type of media used, target audience, and duration and intensity of the intervention. Study variables including design, measures of smoking behaviour reported and length of follow-up would also contribute to potential variation in outcome.</P>

The most recent <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> study used Social Cognitive Theory. <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK> evaluated the effect of a three-week prevention media campaign shown annually for three years, based on provocative emotional appeals (where emotional reactions are thought to influence behaviour), which mainly targeted girls. <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK> evaluated smoking prevention messages broadcast on TV, which were based on the social influences approach, for three 13-week periods over an 18-month period overall.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK> schools-based programmes that emphasized skills to resist social influences to smoke were combined with TV segments, which were broadcast over a period of six weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> tested the effect of adding TV and radio spots to schools-based smoking prevention programmes based on the Social Learning Theory approach, at regular intervals over a four-year period. <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK> used a combination of the social influences theory, combined with the health belief model (HBM) and self-efficacy theory of behaviour change, using six months of in-school curriculum plus a campaign which ran intermittently throughout the follow-up period; the campaign went 'national' for one year between July 1998 and July 1999, and during a third phase which ran from September 1999 to Spring 2004.</P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK> conducted a social media campaign (YouTube, Twitter and Facebook) underpinned by a social branding intervention model conducted over three years.</P>
<P>Five of the studies purchased broadcasting time (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes measured</HEADING>
<P>All studies assessed smoking behaviour by self-report, with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>) validating its findings biochemically, using alveolar carbon monoxide (CO) and saliva thiocyanate levels. Two studies used 'bogus pipeline' measures (where participants are told that samples of their saliva will be analyzed for thiocyanate levels and may be used to verify self-reports of smoking status), in addition to self-reported data (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of different intermediate outcomes, such as knowledge about the effects of smoking, attitudes towards smoking, and intentions to smoke in the future, were assessed in seven of the eight studies (the exception being <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Sequence generation was unclear in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>), and at high risk in the remaining five (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methods for choosing intervention and control areas varied across studies and were influenced by the availability of non-overlapping broadcast regions and by the prohibitive cost of advertising in some areas. Methods for selecting respondents varied between studies, and were largely dependent upon whether a schools-based component was included in the intervention. When interventions were a combination of mass media and schools-based programmes respondents were students within the intervention and control schools (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In those studies where the mass media campaign was the only intervention, methods of selecting respondents differed. In <LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>, a cluster sampling procedure was used to identify a probability sample of households within each SMSA. Households were then screened for young people aged 12 to 14 years. This resulted in a sample of 2534 eligible respondents, of whom 83% participated in baseline measurement. <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK> included all young people aged 14 to 15 years from the two communities allocated to intervention and control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK> selected respondents from 93 schools, although no information is given as to how the schools were selected and no intervention was carried out within the schools. <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> used designated market areas (DMAs) to match four pairs of metropolitan areas across four states, with a total of 98 middle- and high-school clusters available for evaluation at four-year follow-up. These selections were focused on districts serving lower-income and lower-education populations. <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK> recruited youth at social events/locations (10 HAVOC events occurred each year over three years).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Incomplete outcome reporting of data could not be excluded in any of the seven controlled trials and we rated all of them at high risk of bias due to a lack of information from individual study authors. Rates of attrition varied between the seven controlled studies, which could in part be due to differences in the length of follow-up. The study with the longest duration and follow-up also had a high rate of attrition (62% at six-year follow-up) (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>). Attrition rates were also higher in those studies that only included participants in the analysis if they had been present for all of the measurement sessions.</P>
<P>Some studies gave percentages of dropouts according to the reason for non-response; for example, in <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> 82% of dropouts left the community or transferred to private schools and three per cent were refusals to participate in further assessments. Some studies reported differences between those lost to follow-up and those who were available throughout the intervention period. For example, significantly less baseline smoking was reported in those available at follow-up compared with those lost to follow-up (1.3% versus 5.1%, P &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>) failed to address an imbalance in outcome measures at baseline, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>) were unclear, leaving two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>) which adequately addressed this outcome. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK> significant differences in smoking rates were observed, which were at higher significance levels following adjustments to the data. In <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK> the control group were reported to be more likely not to start smoking at baseline, while <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK> reported more male daily smokers in the intervention county at baseline than in the control area.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparability of intervention and control group characteristics at baseline (i.e. similar characteristics of participants in each study arm)</HEADING>
<P>Comparability of interventions at baseline for participant characteristics was unclear in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>), at high risk in three (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>) and addressed in three (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK> there was substantial variation in baseline smoking rates between SMSAs, with smoking levels ranging from 0.6% to 5.2%. This occurred despite selecting regionally-matched communities and adjusting statistically for 10 sociodemographic and personality correlates of adolescent cigarette smoking. However, in some of the included studies minimal or no differences were reported between groups at baseline. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> found differences between groups in the percentage of female participants (52% versus 47%, P = 0.02) and in the ages of participants (10.7 versus 10.8 years, P = 0.002), but no differences in a number of other variables measured at baseline in the same study. The reason for these statistically significant differences is probably to do with the statistical power of the large sample size, rather than differences of clinical significance. In addition, differences found were adjusted for in subsequent analyses.</P>

However, due to the nature of mass media interventions, it is very difficult to find a comparable control group that is not exposed to the intervention media.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>, authors report significant contamination through state-funded tobacco control programmes via the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) running for the duration of the study period (2000 to 2005). During 2002, the first campaign year for this research project, these states spent an average of 26% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended minimum expenditure on tobacco control programming. The CDC estimated that the median number of state-funded anti-tobacco advertising exposures among youth increased from 0.04 a month in 1999 to 0.80 in 2002. Furthermore, a large national youth-focused anti-tobacco media campaign, also funded by the MSA, began in 2000. Authors report that this campaign was active in all of the intervention and comparison DMAs at a high level of intensity throughout the intervention campaigns.</P>

In five studies the main analysis was then presented with the individual as the unit of analysis. All these five studies took account of the unit-of-allocation issue in their analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>), but given that randomization occurred at the community/school level with data reported for individuals, the increase in sample size to adjust for clustering effects was not sufficient. For example, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>) included the community as a random factor nested within treatment, the school a random factor nested within community and the individual a random factor nested within school. Statistical significance associated with the intervention was determined by using community within treatment as the error term. Similarly, another study (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>) modelled individual outcomes as three-level data (students within classrooms within schools), with differences between schools and differences between classrooms treated as random effects and differences between treatments as fixed effects.

<P>We have evaluated eight different mass media programmes as a method of preventing the uptake of smoking in young people.

Campaign components are summarized in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and findings are summarized by comparison below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mass media campaigns versus no intervention</HEADING>
<P>The first comparison concerned the effect of mass media campaigns, compared with no intervention in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. Four of the eight studies made this direct comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>) and one study used a factorial design (i.e. a design consisting of two or more factors, in which the experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors) in which this comparison was made (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A provocative media campaign, aimed primarily at girls, designed to create negative affective reactions was carried out in one county in Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>; n = 6234). The effects of newspaper advertisements, posters, TV and cinema spots of three weeks' duration over three consecutive years were compared to a control county receiving no intervention. Comparison areas were matched on variables such as county size, education level, parental income and smoking prevalence. The overall increase in the proportion of female daily smokers at one-year follow-up was four per cent lower in the media county than in the control county (8.6% compared with 12.4% respectively, P &lt; 0.01). Although not statistically significant, the same trend was apparent for boys; 6.8% in the intervention county compared with 10.5% in the control county. The odds ratio (OR) for being a smoker in the intervention county compared with being a smoker in the control county was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.86), after adjustment for smoking at baseline and gender.</P>
<P>A difficulty with the interpretation of the findings in this study was the difference in survey response rates between the intervention and the control counties (65% versus 70% respectively). In addition, more of the participants lost to follow-up in the intervention county were smokers at baseline than in the control county (18% versus 13%). We recalculated the odds of being a smoker, controlling for smoking habits at baseline and taking into account the differences in response rates between the two counties (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95). Also, no adjustment was made in the analyses for the community being the unit of allocation and the individual the unit of analysis.</P>
<P>In a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>; n = 4005), TV messages designed to prevent the uptake of smoking were targeted at 10- to 12-year-olds within the range of a rural network-affiliate TV station in the USA, over an 18-month period. School districts in adjacent counties, which were out of range of the signal, were matched using census data, and formed the control group. At 18-month follow-up no statistically significant differences were found in smoking behaviour between the intervention and control counties (numerical data not available).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>, n = 1637) compared three different forms of mass media with a control which did not receive any intervention. Radio messages were used to broadcast the negative consequences of smoking; added to this was the promotion of a sweepstake offer, first using the radio and secondly the television. The sweepstake offer encouraged young people to recruit friends into the contest in the hope that discussion about not smoking would take place. Cluster sampling procedures were used to identify probability samples of households within each area, from whom data were collected. Smoking prevalence increased from baseline to follow-up (ranging from two to eight months post-intervention) in all groups, but no significant differences between groups were detected (authors state that <I>F</I> &lt; 1.00 for all groups). There was however substantial variation in baseline smoking between the SMSAs from which the groups were selected (range from 0.6% to 5.2%). This occurred despite selecting regionally-matched communities and adjusting statistically for 10 sociodemographic and personality correlates of adolescent cigarette smoking. The observed rates of adolescent smoking made detection of effects attributable to the campaigns impossible (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-La-Prelle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Prelle 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> (n = 23,246) compared four simultaneous campaigns consisting of specially-developed messages based on behavioural theory (social cognitive theory) and targeting different age groups of racially and ethnically diverse youth. Thirty- and 60-second TV and radio messages were broadcast using purchased time with approximately three to four exposures a week. Approximately 10 messages were chosen for each campaign in 2002. Five additional messages were developed annually for each campaign in 2003 to 2005 (60 in total). Intervention impact on cigarette use in the past 30 days did not show an effect. The 30-day smoking rates appeared to decline in both groups over the four-year interval between baseline and follow-up surveys for participants in both conditions, but this trend was not significant (18.9% to 16.9% for intervention; 17.8% to 15.5% for comparison). Similar results were obtained for seven-day prevalence (weekly smoking) (15.0% to 13.1% for intervention; 13.6% to 11.6% for comparison).</P>

<P>The third comparison concerned the effect of mass media campaigns combined with schools-based programmes compared with media campaigns alone in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. Only one study addressed this comparison in a factorial design expressing combinations of TV only, TV plus classroom curriculum (CR), CR only, and two control groups: treatment as usual and attention control (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>) (discussed in detail later).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mass media campaigns combined with schools-based programmes versus schools-based programmes</HEADING>
<P>The fourth comparison concerned the effect of mass media campaigns combined with schools-based programmes compared with schools-based programmes alone in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. Two studies made this direct comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>) and one study addressed it in a factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> (n = 2860)<I>, s</I>tudents in communities where TV and radio messages were broadcast over a four-year period combined with a schools-based programme teaching refusal skills and skills to resist advertising pressure, were found at two-year follow-up to be at lower risk for weekly smoking than those in communities receiving only the schools-based component (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78). Communities were matched on variables such as size, education level, income and smoking prevalence. There were, however, a few significant differences at baseline between the groups, with the media plus schools-based group having more girls (52% versus 47%, P = 0.02), younger participants (mean 10.7 years versus 10.8 years, P &lt; 0.01) and more participants with an older sibling that smoked (15.8% versus 11.3%, P = 0.06). These differences were, however, adjusted for in subsequent analyses.</P>
<P>The findings of preliminary research conducted with high-risk youth were used to develop the TV and radio spots in this study. When smoking behaviour was examined separately for high- and low-risk youth at two-year follow-up, a 7.3% difference in weekly smoking prevalence favouring the media-school group was found in the high-risk group (28.6% for the media-school group and 35.9% in the school-only group) compared with a 4.3% difference favouring the media-school group in lower-risk students (15.9% in the media-school group and 20.2% in the school-only group). Higher-risk youths were found to report more frequent use of both radio and TV (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>). The success of this programme may have been partly due to the experience gained from an earlier study evaluating the effect of a mass media campaign aimed at preventing the onset of smoking in young people (<LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>; n = 4005).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK> (n = 8291) used a combination of school-based curricula, ALERT (middle-schools) and ALERT Plus (high-schools) in addition to an established media intervention, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. This was part of an effort by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to combat illegal drug use among America&#8217;s youth by means of an advertising and social marketing programme focusing on the dangers of drug use. This campaign targeted a combination of marijuana, alcohol and tobacco prevention for youth. The ALERT condition was a basic prevention curriculum delivered in seventh and eighth grades, whilst ALERT Plus consisted of the same curriculum with the addition of booster lessons added for ninth and tenth grades (i.e. extra annual lessons), compared to a control condition of no intervention. Overall smoking behaviour favoured both ALERT and ALERT Plus, producing a 19% and 23% reduction respectively in weekly and monthly smokers (P &lt; 0.01) by 18-month post-baseline surveys for both groups combined (ALERT and ALERT Plus together). During the same time, cigarette initiation rates in the control schools climbed to 31.6% by the end of eighth grade. However, initiation rates were significantly lower (25.5%) in the ALERT schools by the same time. Notably, any effect of the mass media intervention is confounded by the other ALERT programme components and it is therefore impossible to discern if the observed differences are due to the mass media campaign or to other elements of the ALERT programme.</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; n = 4134) compared five different programmes; TV only, TV plus classroom programme, classroom only, and two control groups ('attention control' and a 'no intervention control') to influence the smoking behaviour of young people. All programmes were based on the social influences approach for prevention and cessation. A blocked randomized design was used to allocate schools within two counties in the USA to either intervention or control conditions. At two-year follow-up there were no significant programme effects on smoking behaviour or smoking intentions in any of the intervention groups (Control pretest mean = 2.09 versus two-year follow-up = 2.76; TV intervention group pretest mean = 2.06 versus two-year follow-up = 2.91). However, it should be noted that the TV component of the programme did not meet the original objectives, in that social resistance skills were not demonstrated in the way that is necessary for adequate learning to take place. Scripted demonstrations of prevention skills were not allowed to be shown due to commercial news organization (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>One study used time series to evaluate the efficacy of a social media campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>; n = 3348). Smoking rates did not change in the total sample (44.1% at Time 1, 45.0% at Time 2 and 47.4% at Time 3, P = 0.17); Participants unable to recall HAVOC messages were significantly more likely (P = 0.003) to be daily (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.17) and non-daily (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.30) smokers compared to participants who could recall HAVOC messages. Similarly, 'Partiers' (described as participants who frequently attended nightclubs, desired to engage in &#8216;exclusive&#8217; experiences such as VIP lounges, were fashion-conscious, and were concerned with physical attractiveness and achieving social status by exuding an image of confidence and financial success) who recalled HAVOC messaging were significantly less likely to smoke daily than those who could not recall HAVOC messaging (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.95; P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Smoking attitudes</HEADING>
<P>Five studies reported on smoking attitudes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), with two favouring the intervention, two showing no evidence of any effect and <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> favouring the control.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK> (n = 4134) a marginally significant overall effect (P &lt; 0.06) was observed. However there was a significant interaction between television and social resistance conditions at immediate post-test, (P &lt; 0.03). In San Diego there was more positive change in the social resistance condition, (P &lt; 0.003) toward disapproval of parental smoking (Intervention description 4 in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). In <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> (n = 2860), attitudes towards smoking (change score of 0.37 versus 0.25 on a multiple-item Likert scale, P &lt; 0.05) changed in a positive direction in the media-schools group compared with the schools-only group. When analyzing attitudes in <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> (n = 23,246), positive outcome expectation scores increased significantly over time in both study groups, an unfavourable change, whilst negative outcome expectation scores decreased in the comparison but not in the intervention group, although this was not statistically significant.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK> (n = 6234) statistically significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in intentions to smoke in the future.

In <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> (n = 2860) a significant difference in change over time was found between girls in the two treatment groups, with a lower increase among girls in the media-school communities in intentions to smoke cigarettes (P &lt; 0.01).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:06:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To summarize, three out of eight studies demonstrated statistically and clinically significant reductions for smoking uptake in young people. The remaining five studies did not detect a statistically significant effect. Common features in these successful campaigns included multiple channels for media delivery (e.g. newspapers, television, radio, posters, etc.), combined school and media components (through school posters or school-based curricula, or both), and repeated exposure to campaign messages consecutively delivered for the same cohort of students over a minimum period of three years. Two of the three successful campaigns were based on the 'social influences' or 'social learning theory' approach, one of which also incorporated the HBM. The other successful campaign used provocative messages to cause effective personal reactions. However two of the remaining five studies, which did not produce any statistical benefit, also used the social influences approach. Two of the five unsuccessful studies had short campaign durations (two weeks for one study, and four weeks for another), and were less intense than the successful campaigns. The remaining three studies demonstrating no benefit had longer durations (three periods of 13-week television smoking prevention messages - 39 weeks in total; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK> ran for the full four-year study period, whilst the more recent <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK> included multiple events over three years). However, the lack of a structured curriculum component to support these messages, such as those in the combined school-based studies, is one possible explanation for the eventual failure in preventing the uptake of smoking in young people.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that a number of mass media campaigns have failed to achieve their objectives as they were not adequately piloted prior to implementation (<LINK REF="REF-Chollat_x002d_Traquet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chollat-Traquet 1996</LINK>). However, most of the studies included in this review devoted considerable time and resources to the development and refinement of intervention components (formative research). In most studies data were collected from groups of people who represented the potential target audience, for example in both the Flynn studies the messages were developed from intensive diagnostic surveys and focus groups with the target population. Depending upon the response from group participants, modifications were made to specific components of the campaign. New sets of spots were created on an annual basis to keep pace with the changing interests of the target audience (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>). Similarly, one study found that the preferences differed for either radio or TV, depending upon the age of the participants, with older youths preferring the radio (<LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK> tested the appropriateness of the time of broadcast in reaching the target audience during the developmental stage of the programme. Qualitative formative research was also conducted in <LINK REF="STD-Fallin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallin 2015</LINK>, through six two-hour focus groups among 43 participants. From this research, six different peer crowds were identified (i.e. country, hipster, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT), partier, mainstream and urban), which then directed the focus of the intervention.</P>
<P>The importance of adequate design and development prior to the launch of any media campaign is emphasized in the Social Marketing Approach. This approach attempts to apply the principles of advertising and marketing to the 'selling' of positive health behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Wallack-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallack 1990</LINK>). Emphasis is placed on the involvement of small groups of representative samples of those at whom the campaign is directed. Such groups might, for example, be involved in message development. This approach gives a strong focus to consumer needs and differs from other approaches where message development was carried out with little input from the intended audience.</P>
<P>The three successful campaigns were similar in intensity and duration, which was more varied across the studies which did not report positive findings. In <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> there were averages of 190 TV, 350 cable TV and 350 radio spots purchased in each of the four years during which the campaign was running. Similarly, 167 TV and cinema spots were shown in each of the three annual campaigns described by <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK> used the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, which ran for six-and-a-half years and used television (local, cable, and network), radio, websites, magazines, movie theatres and several other media. In comparison, both the intensity and duration of the campaigns in the other studies were much reduced. Both the intensity and duration of any campaign are likely to be important factors in influencing health-related behaviour. A review assessing the effect of the mass media as a smoking cessation intervention with adults also found that campaigns that were more intense in reach, frequency and duration were the most effective in reducing smoking rates (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1987b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the three studies reducing smoking behaviour targeted specific populations; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK> targeted girls, while <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK> targeted higher-risk groups, defined by parental education attainment and income levels. <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK> also presented data in subanalysis based around high-risk populations. <LINK REF="STD-Worden-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Worden 1983</LINK> also targeted girls, who had higher baseline smoking rates than boys. There are large and persistent racial, gender and class differences in smoking rates (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 1988</LINK>). Rates of smoking have been reported to vary among subgroups within the teenage population (<LINK REF="REF-Babar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Badovinac-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badovinac 1995</LINK>). In the UK, socio-economic differences in smoking rates have been reported in the 16- to 24-year-old age group. For example, smoking rates among non-manual groups is 25%, compared with 35% for manual groups (<LINK REF="REF-HEA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">HEA 1997</LINK>). Most media campaigns to date have not specifically targeted high-risk groups.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:06:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on an assessment of the most methodologically rigorous set of studies evaluating the effect of mass media campaigns directed at youth, there is some evidence that some media campaigns can be effective in preventing the uptake of smoking in young people; however the evidence is not strong and contains a number of methodological flaws, and most of the studies did not detect an effect. Moreover, inclusion of only eight studies presented in such a way as not to facilitate presentation as a meta-analysis further reduces our ability to draw reliable conclusions based on the available evidence. Findings from this review should therefor be interpreted with caution, and the questions posed by this review remains unanswered.</P>
<P>In addition, most of the media programmes described in the included studies were made up of several different components, including the use of different media channels such as television, radio, newspapers, etc. However, most programmes did not assess the independent effect of the separate components. There is therefore little information about which aspect of the campaign had the most impact with which group(s). It is also important to note that any influence mass media may have on the prevention of adolescent smoking may be negated by social, family and peer pressures in each individual's environment, as noted by <LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2003</LINK>. This study also concluded that anti-smoking advertising appeared to have more reliable positive effects on those in pre-adolescence or early adolescence by preventing smoking uptake. Furthermore, reaching youth through the tried and tested mass media outlets as outlined in this review is becoming more difficult, with rapid advances in communications and technologies such as TIVO, which allows viewers to skip over advertisements. Other media outlets popular with youth need to be targeted for future campaigns, such as social media, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. For example, a study in Greece piloted a Facebook-integrated educational intervention in a single high school among 225 students aged 15 to 18 years. The lecture was designed to stimulate social mobilization in online networks. Three days after the lecture, 15.9% of students had posted a smoking-related sentence in their Facebook account which was spread as a note on their wall through news feeds, reaching a cumulative total of 20,095 Facebook friends (<LINK REF="REF-Kousoulis-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kousoulis 2016</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:07:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, we rated the overall quality of the evidence in this review as very low according to GRADE standards. This is due to inconsistency in study characteristics and findings, and to serious issues with risks of bias. All the included studies in this review had at least four significant methodological limitations based on the 'Risk of bias' assessments (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). Findings from these studies should therefore be interpreted with caution, given the general limitations of primary research in this area. A problem common to several of the studies is the allocation of communities, areas or schools to intervention or control, followed by analysis at the level of the individual. Individuals are often used as the unit of analysis because this increases the power of the study, which in turn gives a greater chance of finding positive programme effects. Ignoring the correct unit of analysis may lead to spurious positive findings (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). Study participants should not be treated as independent individuals, as it is likely that participants within a community will be more alike than a random sample of participants from several communities. Two sources of variation exist: that between individuals in a community and that between communities. The variability between communities must be taken into account in the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>). One way of overcoming this problem is to correct at the individual-level analysis for community- or school-level variation using multilevel data. Five of the included studies accounted for the unit of allocation in their analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longshore-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longshore 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention it is not possible to blind participants to the intervention they receive. Although the individual student's awareness may not have a direct effect on the outcome, the staff and teachers at schools may introduce a bias into this population, as evidenced in <LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>, where 85% of the population in one school enrolled after a teacher had been assigned by the principal to serve as school co-ordinator for the local 'Great American Smokeout', sponsored by the American Cancer Society. She heard the sweepstakes offer on the radio, obtained a copy of the broadcast tape from a local radio station, played the tape over the school's electronic announcement system, and then organized the mail-in campaign. Control group participants may therefore have been exposed to the radio segments.</P>
<P>Differences at baseline between control and intervention communities was a problem common to many of the studies, making it difficult to attribute any differences at follow-up to the intervention alone. Differences at baseline between the groups may cause different rates of change in the outcome of interest. Attrition was also a problem common to most studies in this review, and ranged from 22% to 62%. When the effect of an intervention is expected to be small or the incidence of a behaviour is low, or both conditions apply, as with adolescent tobacco use, collecting follow-up data from as many participants as possible is vital for achieving adequate statistical power to be able to determine the effect of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1997</LINK>). The results reported in the eight studies tended to be based on outcome data relating to a subsample of participants rather than on the basis of allocation to groups. Evaluation of effect on the basis of data provided by those participants available at follow-up is likely to be biased. For example, in three studies dropouts were reported as more likely to be smokers or at risk of becoming a smoker, than those respondents available at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>). In addition, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>) significantly less baseline smoking was reported in those available at follow-up compared with those lost to follow-up (1.3% versus 5.1%, P &lt; 0.01). This is particularly problematic when there are more dropouts who are at risk in the intervention group than in the control group. This was the case in <LINK REF="STD-Hafstad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hafstad 1997</LINK>, where 18% of those lost to follow-up were smokers in the intervention group, compared with 13% in the control group. We recalculated the odds of becoming a smoker, controlling for smoking habits at baseline and assuming that the proportion of smokers who dropped out in the intervention group was three times higher than among the respondents. We assumed that the proportion of smokers who dropped out from the control group was twice as high as among respondents. The OR for being a smoker in the intervention group compared with the control group was then 0.84 (95% CI 0.8 to 0.9).</P>

<P>Despite the problems common to most of the studies which met the inclusion criteria for this review, they represent the most methodologically rigorous set of studies evaluating the effect of the mass media in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. We had to exclude many studies relating to smoking prevention campaigns, due to design issues or simply that no smoking-related outcomes were reported (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table). In particular, we excluded one previously included study due to an inadequate comparison between groups. The intervention population was made up of self-selected schools and the control group contained schools which did not respond to the invitation to participate (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1987a</LINK>), thus affecting the validity of comparing groups. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Sly-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 2001</LINK>), which examined the Florida "truth" campaign met all the inclusion criteria, but we excluded it just before completion of this review as no information was presented or available for the control population at follow-up. Other evaluations of this campaign could also not be included for the same reasons. Campaigns have frequently either not been evaluated, i.e. they are merely described, or evaluation has been by a survey of the number of people who report awareness of the campaign. We had to exclude one of the most expensive media campaigns in the smoking field, due to a lack of proper evaluation. The California Tobacco Education Media Campaign cost USD 28.6 million, funded out of a state-mandated charge on cigarettes. Evaluation consisted of comparing smoking behaviour pre- and post-intervention in different samples, including school-age youths, plus comparisons between students who reported being unexposed and exposed to the campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Popham-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Popham 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>As we found only eight studies for inclusion within the review it is difficult to determine the extent to which the results can be generalized. It is also possible that we may have missed unpublished programme evaluations which may have met our inclusion criteria; given the absence of study registers for these sorts of assessments, we were unable to systematically search the 'grey' literature for unpublished studies.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-29 16:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane Review of mass media interventions for smoking cessation in adults included 11 studies, with evidence of benefit for the mass media campaigns (<LINK REF="REF-Bala-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bala 2013</LINK>). Of these studies, only three did not show significant decreases in smoking. The authors report that the intensity and duration of mass media campaigns are likely to influence efficacy. However, they found no consistent relationship between campaign effect, age, education, ethnicity or gender. Another Cochrane Review evaluating mass media campaigns for preventing illicit drug use amongst youth included 23 studies, but because of varying scales used to assess outcomes could not formulate a reliable conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allara-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allara 2015</LINK>). Pooled results from five randomized controlled trials did not identify any effect for the mass media intervention. A third Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK>), focusing specifically on school-based programmes for preventing smoking in youth, included 134 studies, with tobacco prevention cohorts producing a significant effect at longest follow-up for the school-based programmes (average 12% reduction in starting smoking compared to the control group). However, at one year or less no overall effect was detected. Studies that combined social competence with social influence interventions were the most effective, while the least effective were those using only social influences, multimodal interventions and information-only interventions. Another study focusing specifically on adolescents from a tribal area in India found that school programmes may have some limitations due to high-school dropout and low enrolment (<LINK REF="REF-Zahiruddin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahiruddin 2011</LINK>). This highlights the need for a broader message delivery system such as mass media that does not rely solely on the school system.</P>
<P>A review examining the equity impact of interventions and policies for reducing smoking in youth (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2014</LINK>) identified 38 studies involving various interventions, including smoke-free policies, taxation, mass media campaigns, advertising controls, access restrictions, etc. Very few of these studies assessed the equity impact (consideration of populations with lower socioeconomic status and minority groups), highlighting a gap in the current literature. Another review of 34 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2015</LINK>) evaluating the potential effect of anti-tobacco media campaigns across racial/ethnic populations with consideration of the socio-economic status of participants confirms these findings. Despite the large number of included studies, the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether campaign outcomes differ by socio-economic status and population density. One Cochrane Review of three studies focusing specifically on tobacco prevention for Indigenous youth found some potentially problematic results, with more participants in the control population of one included trial reporting less smoking at final follow-up compared to those in the intervention group (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012</LINK>). Authors of that trial confirm that the results were not adjusted for ethnicity, as there were more Indigenous youth in the intervention arm and Indigenous youth were more likely to take up smoking, which would subsequently influence the results (<LINK REF="REF-Glover-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glover 2009</LINK>). However, this outcome highlights that tobacco prevention interventions need to be effectively evaluated, as there is potential for harm. This is of particular relevance for large-scale government-funded campaigns such as 'The Real Cost', which is an anti-tobacco media campaign funded by the USA Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2014</LINK>). To enhance the efficacy and cost effectiveness of these programmes scientific evaluations must be conducted throughout the entire campaign.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2015</LINK> review reported above, it is also worth noting that campaigns that were more likely to have messages retained, included those with personal testimonials, a surprising narrative, intense images, sound and editing. Importantly, evidence supporting messages about health consequences were mixed. In the past anti-tobacco messages using scare tactics have not been successful in deterring initiation of tobacco use or reducing the number of cigarettes smoked by youth (<LINK REF="REF-Lantz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lantz 2000</LINK>). It is not a coincidence that tobacco company-funded anti-smoking campaigns, such as the Philip Morris &#8216;Think. Don&#8217;t smoke&#8217; campaign, use these scare tactics and have subsequently been associated with poor tobacco prevention outcomes, in some cases leaving youth open to the idea of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Farrelly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrelly 2002</LINK>). These campaigns have a focus on the negative side of tobacco and use standard print brochures, rather than empowerment and new forms of technology. Technology-based message delivery has the potential to be an effective vehicle for youth health interventions, as there is an opportunity to tailor and individualize, focusing on particular characteristics of the user (e.g. gender, age and heritage), thereby increasing the relevance of the health message and lowering the risk of attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2009</LINK>). A 2010 study identified that the average time spent with screen media among eight- to 18-year-olds is more than twice the average amount of time spent in school each year (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-Family-Foundation-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser Family Foundation 2010</LINK>). Health interventions using (social) media, games and the internet have been found to be effective, specifically when offering more than merely an educational non-interactive experience (<LINK REF="REF-Hieftje-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hieftje 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous reviews of the literature have assessed the effect of mass media campaigns in influencing smoking behaviour in young people. They have, however, included other types of intervention such as schools-based programmes or community initiatives, and have not included all relevant studies in any one area (<LINK REF="REF-Farrelly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrelly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friend-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friend 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-US-DHHS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">US DHHS 1994</LINK>). Overall, these reviews have reported mixed results for the effect of the mass media, particularly for smaller community-level campaigns. Regardless of this, the potential to influence youth smoking rates has still been demonstrated. There have been other reviews of the literature which have concentrated exclusively on the mass media, but smoking cessation with adult smokers has been the focus (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1987b</LINK>). These reviews of smoking cessation have concluded that mass media campaigns can reduce smoking rates, particularly campaigns that are more intense in terms of reach, frequency and duration (<LINK REF="STD-Flay-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Flay 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flay-1987c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flay 1987c</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of the literature has identified a number of different environmental, sociodemographic, behavioural and personal factors associated with the onset of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Tyas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyas 1997</LINK>). The peer group, in particular, has been thought to play an important role in influencing smoking behaviour. A key theoretical perspective used to explain the association between peer smoking and adolescents' smoking is the 'social influences' or Social Learning Theory approach, which predicts that young people will anticipate, initiate and adopt smoking as part of the socialization process (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 1988</LINK>). Social Learning Theory not only explains how people acquire and maintain behaviours but also provides the basis for intervention and behaviour change.</P>

<P>Of the eight included studies, three detected a significant effect in reducing smoking rates and five detected no effect. The three interventions for which an effect was detected included the following characteristics. However, these characteristics were also present in some of the interventions that did not demonstrate an effect.:<BR/>- they built upon elements of existing campaigns that have been shown to be effective, rather than repeating methods that have been unsuccessful;<BR/>- developmental work was carried out with representative samples of the target audience;<BR/>- campaign messages were guided by theoretical concepts about how behaviours are acquired and maintained;<BR/>- media messages were designed to reach the target audience (via media channels preferred by the target audience at the most appropriate times);<BR/>- the broadcasting of campaigns was of considerable intensity, frequency and duration;<BR/>- in two instances, campaigns were combined with a structured support curriculum such as those available via school-based collaborations.</P>

<P>Evaluation of mass media prevention campaigns is methodologically challenging, but rigorous evaluation of media campaigns is required in order to demonstrate intervention effect. Evaluations must be carefully planned, to ensure that:<BR/>- sample sizes are adequate to detect significant effects if they exist;<BR/>- follow-up data are obtained from a high proportion of initial participants;<BR/>- analysis is performed at the correct level, for example, if communities are the unit of allocation then they should also be the unit of analysis or make adequate adjustment if individual-level data are used;<BR/>- which programme components are effective is determined by the use of fully factorial designs;<BR/>- outcome measures address the outcome of interest, i.e. smoking behaviour, in addition to intermediate outcomes such as attitudes to smoking and process measures such as media reach;<BR/>- control groups mirror the demographics of the intervention population;<BR/>- the latest media vehicles used by youth are evaluated, including the internet and other communication devices.</P>

<P>3 (n = 17,385), 1 which compared a mass media intervention to no intervention and 2 which evaluated mass media interventions as adjuncts to school-based interventions, found that the mass media interventions reduced the smoking behaviour of young people. The remaining 5 studies (n = 72,740) did not detect a significant effect on smoking behaviour. These included 3 studies comparing a mass media intervention with no intervention, 1 study evaluating a mass media intervention as an adjunct to a school-based intervention, and 1 interrupted time-series study of a social media intervention.</P>

<P>There were significantly lower prevalence estimates, (peer) for the social resistance, (P &lt; 0.001) and television (P &lt; 0.006) conditions, and at 2 years the main effect of the social resistance conditions remained. However, the presence of a significant interaction between the television and social resistance conditions (P &lt; 0.05) indicated that the lower prevalence estimates of the social resistance condition was increased in the television plus social resistance condition.</P>

</P>
<P>A significant difference in change over time was found between girls in the 2 treatment groups with scores increasing less among girls in the media-school communities, for perceived peer smoking (P &lt; 0.01). This difference was likely due to the slightly older age and greater representation of boys in the school-only group.</P>
<P>A significant difference was evident at grades 5 to 7, that persisted at grades 8 to 10, for perceived norms (P &lt; 0.01).</P>

<P>Some journals identified from the original review's reference lists of retrieved papers or books were searched individually on the Social Science Citation Index (on the BIDS service) (1981 to July 1998) as special case journals. The journal title was searched and results were combined with the following search terms: smoking or cigarette or tobacco. The special case journals included: Health Communication; Journal of Consumer Research; Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media; Journal of Communication; Media, Culture and Society. The journal Tobacco Control was hand searched (1992 to Summer 1997). References were also located through the bibliographies of related papers, and through personal contact with content area specialists.</P>
