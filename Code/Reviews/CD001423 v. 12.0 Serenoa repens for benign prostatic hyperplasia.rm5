<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-02 11:59:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland that is caused by an increase in volume of epithelial (top layer of tissue that line cavities and surfaces of the body) and stromal (connective tissue) cells. This increase in cells can, over time, create fairly large, discrete nodules in the periurethral region of the prostate, and in turn can restrict the urethral canal causing partial or complete blockage.</P>
<P>The use of plants and herbs (phytotherapy) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH is common and has been growing steadily in most Western countries. The extract of the berry of the American saw palmetto, or dwarf palm plant, <I>Serenoa repens </I>(SR), which is<I> </I>also known by its botanical name of <I>Sabal serrulatum</I>, is one of several phytotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of BPH.</P>
<P>The update of this review included 32 randomized controlled trials involving 5666 men.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, <I>Serenoa repens</I>, at double and triple the usual dose, provides no improvement for nocturia, peak urine flow, and symptom scores for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-12 11:59:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate, which can lead to obstructive and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The pharmacologic use of plants and herbs (phytotherapy) for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH is common. The extract of the berry of the American saw palmetto, or dwarf palm plant, <I>Serenoa repens </I>(SR), which is<I> </I>also known by its botanical name of <I>Sabal serrulatum</I>, is one of several phytotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of BPH.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-04-02 15:36:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>This systematic review aimed to assess the effects and harms of <I>Serenoa repens</I> in the treatment of men with LUTS consistent with BPH.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-04-02 15:35:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>We searched for trials in general and in specialized databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cochrane_clcentral_articles_fs.html">CENTRAL</A>), <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">MEDLINE®</A>, <A HREF="http://www.embase.com/">EMBASE</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ebscohost.com/cinahl/">CINAHL®</A>, <A HREF="http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science/">Web of Science</A>, <A HREF="http://www.info.sciverse.com/scopus/">SCOPUS</A>, <A HREF="http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/biosis_previews/">BIOSIS Previews®</A>, <A HREF="http://www.bireme.br">LILACS</A>, <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, <A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">Controlled-Trials.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">World Health Organization</A> (WHO), and <A HREF="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ws">Google Scholar</A>. We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical practice guidelines. There were no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-16 10:13:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Trials were eligible if they randomized men with symptomatic BPH to receive preparations of SR (alone or in combination) for at least four weeks in comparison with placebo or other interventions, and included clinical outcomes, such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, and urodynamic measurements. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers (JT, RM).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-01 08:32:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>One review author (JT) extracted Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes which was then checked by another review author (RM). The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of SR with active or inert controls was change in urologic symptom-scale scores, with validated scores taking precedence over non validated ones. Secondary outcomes included changes in nocturia and urodynamic measures. The main outcome measure for harms was the number of men reporting side effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-05 13:56:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In a meta-analysis of two high quality long-term trials (n = 582), <I>Serenoa repens</I> therapy was not superior to placebo in reducing LUTS based on the AUA (mean difference (MD) 0.25 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.58 to 1.07). A 72 week trial with high quality evidence, using the American Urological Association Symptom Score Index, reported that SR was not superior to placebo at double and triple doses. In the same trial the proportions of clinical responders (&#8805; three-point improvement) were nearly identical (42.6% and 44.2% for SR and placebo, respectively), and not significant (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.22).</P>
<P>This update, which did not change our previous conclusions, included two new trials with 444 additional men, an 8.5% (5666/5222) increase from our 2009 updated review, and a 28.8% (1988/1544) increase for our main comparison, SR monotherapy versus placebo control (17 trials). Overall, 5666 men were assessed from 32 randomized, controlled trials, with trial lengths from four to 72 weeks. Twenty-seven trials were double blinded and treatment allocation concealment was adequate in 14.</P>
<P>In a trial of high quality evidence (N = 369), versus placebo, SR did not significantly decrease nightly urination on the AUA Nocturia scale (range zero to five) at 72 weeks follow-up (one-sided P = 0.19).</P>
<P>The three high quality, moderate-to-long term trials found peak urine flow was not improved with <I>Serenoa repens </I>compared with placebo (MD 0.40 mL/s, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.09).</P>
<P>Comparing prostate size (mean change from baseline), one high quality 12-month trial (N = 225) reported no significant difference between SR and placebo (MD -1.22 cc, 95% CI -3.91 to 1.47).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-02 14:47:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-04-02 14:47:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In the hyperplastic prostate, as compared to a healthy one, cell proliferation (epithelial and stromal cells) and cell death have achieved disequilibrium, causing a net increase of cells in the organ. This process is not well understood, but the evidence suggests an interplay among "[a]ndrogens, estrogens, stromal-epithelial interactions, growth factors, and neurotransmitters[,] &#8230; either singly or in combination, in the etiology of the hyperplastic process" (see Table of key terms (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>)) (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2010</LINK>). This increase in cells can, over time, create fairly large, discrete nodules in the periurethral region of the prostate, and in turn, can restrict the urethral canal causing partial or complete blockage.</P>
<P>Histological evidence of the prevalence of BPH is found in more than 40% of men in their fifties and nearly 90% of men in their eighties (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1984</LINK>). Absolute prevalence rates of BPH differ widely in a number of multinational, longitudinal, population-based studies (<LINK REF="REF-Meigs-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meigs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platz 2002</LINK>), although they are strikingly consistent in age-related increases that parallel Berry's reporting in his biopsy and cadaver study (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1984</LINK>). In 2000 in the US there were approximately 4.5 million visits to physicians that resulted in a primary diagnosis of BPH; in the same year there were nearly 8 million visits that resulted in a primary or secondary diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Urologic-Diseases-in-American-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urologic Diseases in American 2007</LINK>). In our 2002 update (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2002</LINK>), we reported 300,000 prostatectomies for BPH annually (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 1994</LINK>), and in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Tacklind-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tacklind 2009</LINK>), we reported slightly more than 87,000 prostatectomies for BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Urologic-Diseases-in-American-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urologic Diseases in American 2007</LINK>). This more than three-fold decrease in transurethral resections of the prostate (TURPs) - formerly the gold standard of practice for severe symptomatic BPH - is negatively correlated to the medical management of BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Lepor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McConnell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 2003</LINK>). Complementing this trend, phytotherapy has been growing steadily in most Western countries. Phytotherapeutic agents represent nearly half of the medications dispensed for BPH in Italy, compared with 5% for &#945;-blockers and 5% for 5-ARIs (5&#945;-reductase inhibitors) (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Silverio-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Silverio 1993</LINK>). In Germany and Austria, phytotherapy is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate urinary obstructive symptoms and represents more than 90% of all drugs prescribed for the treatment of BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Buck-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 1996</LINK>). In the United States its use has also markedly increased. In a 2002 survey, SR was used by 2.5 million adults, "often for BPH" (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2002</LINK>). A fairly recent survey demonstrated that one third of men choosing non surgical therapy for BPH were using herbal preparations alone or in combination with prescription medications (<LINK REF="REF-Bales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bales 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the clinical indication of BPH, i.e., BPH + symptoms (retention, inability to empty bladder, overactive bladder), the link between them is less secure now than it was, and it is now thought that "a significant portion of LUTS is due to age-related detrusor dysfunction" (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2010</LINK>). LUTS is also seen in men with sleep disorders and polyuria. Nevertheless, there is significant epidemiologic evidence that progressive BPH is associated with LUTS (<LINK REF="REF-Roehrborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roehrborn 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>There are about 30 phytotherapeutic compounds available for the treatment of BPH, and one of the most widely used is an extract from the berry of the American saw palmetto or dwarf palm plant, <I>Serenoa repens</I>, which is also known by its botanical name of <I>Sabal serrulatum</I>. While the purported mechanism of its relief of LUTS secondary to BPH is unknown, some of those proposed are:</P>

<P>The causes of LUTS related to BPH are not entirely known, although it is theorized that a combination of prostatic cellular proliferation (BPH) and smooth muscle dysfunction are likely reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell_x002d_Walsh-Urology-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell-Walsh Urology 2010</LINK>). The efficacy of SR, if it exists, is dependent on one, both, or an unknown pathway.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-12-16 10:03:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In the West, phytotherapies, and in particular SR, are widely used for the relief of urinary symptoms attributed to BPH. It is therefore useful to patients, clinicians, and health policy makers, to determine the comparative effectiveness and harms of SR.</P>

<P>As a measure of overall methodologic study quality &#8211; and bias &#8211; we assessed scales and criteria developed by Schulz and The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The following seven criteria were addressed.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection bias I (Was there an articulated rule for allocating interventions based on chance?).</LI>
<LI>Selection bias II (Was there any foreknowledge of the allocation of interventions by anyone?).</LI>
<LI>Blinding bias I (During the course of the trial were study participants and personnel blinded to the knowledge of who received which intervention?).</LI>
<LI>Blinding bias II (Were the outcome assessors blinded to who received the intervention and who did not?).</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias (Did the trial assess all patients, or account for those not assessed?).</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias (Were outcomes selectively reported?).</LI>
<LI>Other bias (Were arms assessed differently?).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Each criterion was answered by 'low risk', 'unclear risk', and 'high risk', and summarized here (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:44:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>We performed our statistical analysis according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2011</LINK>). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed using risk ratios (RR) or absolute risk reductions (RD), using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MD), or, for unequal scales, standardized mean differences (SMD). To minimize the uncertainty of the pooled-effect estimate, we used an inverse variance method, which allowed larger trials with smaller SEM (standard error of the mean) more weight over smaller trials with larger SEM.</P>

<P>This updated review (2012) found two new trials (n = 444), an 8.5% increase from our last update in 2009. Overall, 5666 men were assessed,</P>
<P>Overall (32 studies), weighted mean follow-up was 29.2 weeks, and ranged from 4 to 72 weeks. The weighted mean age of all enrollees was 64.6 years (25 studies). The age of participants from reporting studies ranged from 40 to 90 years (21 studies). The percentage of men who dropped out or were lost to follow-up was 10.4% (590/5666) and ranged from 0% to 21.4% (32 studies). Only one trial assessed compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Shi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2008</LINK>), which was, after 12 weeks, 98% for the verum arm, and 100% for the placebo arm.</P>
<P>Fifteen trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bent-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bent 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carraro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carraro 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debruyne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Debruyne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engelmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Engelmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gerber 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gl_x00e9_main-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Glémain 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hizli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hizli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopatkin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lopatkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metzker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Metzker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preuss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Preuss 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_keland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sökeland 1997</LINK>) provided efficacy outcomes using validated, identical, self-reporting questionnaires (AUA, IPSS), and which were graded on a zero ("Never") to five ("Almost always") scale, for a total score of 35 points.</P>
<P>Of the included trials, 12 used Permixon®, a commercialized extract of the fruit of SR. Of these 12, seven compared Permixon® with placebo; the remaining trials compared Permixon®, either alone or in combination (e.g., Permixon® + tamsulosin), to finasteride, tamsulosin, and Depostat. Five studies compared another standardized combination of SR and (160 mg) and <I>Urtica dioica</I> extracts (120 mg), and which is known by the commercial name Prostagutt® forte, or PRO 160/120. Of these, three compared PRO 160/120 with placebo, one with finasteride, and one with tamsulosin. Fourteen trials used generic SR alone or in combination with other phytotherapies (pumpkin seeds, vitamins A and E, nettle root, <I>Pygeum africanum</I>).</P>
<P>Twenty-two of the 32 included trials reported racial data. Ninety-five per cent (3511/3678) of participants were White, 1.5% (55/3678) were African American, 1.2% (43/3678) were Hispanic, and 3.1% (115/3678) were Asian/Pacific Islanders. All studies reported regional affiliations; accumulatively, all save four could be dichotomized between Europe and the United States. Nearly 84% (4400/5267) of study participants were European, and 16.5% (867/5267) American.</P>
<P>The weighted mean baseline PSA (nine trials) was 2.8 ng/mL, and ranged from 1.7 ng/mL to 3.4 ng/mL. The weighted mean baseline prostate volume (12 trials) was 43.6 cc, and ranged from 33 cc to 57 cc.</P>

In 2008 we reversed course and reported SR was not superior to placebo for symptom scores (MD -0.77 points, 95% CI -2.88 to 1.34). Heterogeneity was high (I<SUP>&#8322;</SUP> = 63%) but we thought the high quality <LINK REF="STD-Bent-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bent 2006</LINK> trial carried the day. In 2012, with <LINK REF="STD-Barry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2011</LINK>, we now have another adequately powered, high quality, long-term (follow-up 72 weeks), dose-finding trial (320 mg/d, 640 mg/d, 960 mg/d), which found SR not superior to placebo at 24, 48, and 72 weeks, respectively. In the meta-analysis of this trial with the other high quality trial from the 2009 update, there was no significant difference between arms (MD -0.25 points, 95% CI -0.58 to 1.07) and heterogeneity was nonexistent (I<SUP>&#8322;</SUP> = 0%). <LINK REF="STD-Barry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2011</LINK> also reported responders (men with &#8805; three-point improvement) and found the risk ratio favored placebo, but not significantly (0.96 ,95% CI 0.76 to 1.22).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-01 08:56:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The overall completeness of the evidence was good in 2012, and much better than it was at the inauguration of this review in 1998. For example, of the 14 trials that were placebo controlled and compared with SR monotherapy, seven utilized the commercialized Permixon®. Sixteen of the 32 trials used a validated score - the AUA or IPSS - to assess symptoms. Fifteen of 16 of those trials provided baseline or endpoint IPSS or AUA scores, although not all gave measures of variance (10 did). Of 15 trials with baseline or endpoint data for nocturia, 12 provided means, one provided "per cent with nocturia," and two the AUA nocturia score. Twenty-three trials reported baseline and endpoint data for peak urine flow, and seven reported mean differences. Eleven of 32 trials provided data at baseline or endpoint for prostate size, and four provided mean change with measures of variance.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-04-01 08:56:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Perhaps the outstanding problem in our first published review (1998) was underpowered trials. Of 18, only six randomized 100 men or more. In this updated review of 32 trials, 15 randomized 100 men or more (range 100 to 1098). This trend toward higher powered trials - and with corresponding smaller CI - yields better statistical evidence. Another significant problem was the use of non validated symptom scores. In 1998 17% (3/18) of trials used validated scores; in this update 50% (16/32) do. In this update, 14 trials reported nocturia data at baseline and endpoint, most with measures of variance, but only two reported mean changes and variances, a better statistical metric that yields smaller confidence intervals and standard errors and thus a truer estimate of effect. Data reporting for prostate size was slightly better; five trials reported baselines and endpoints for prostate size, and four reported mean changes with variances. Peak urine flow was reported best: 15 trials reported baselines and endpoints; seven reported mean changes with variances.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-04-02 14:50:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>From our very first review in 1998 we were sensitive to biases among trials and decided a priori to report outcomes via a random-effects model, which is a more conservative estimate of treatment effect. By the end of the 14 following years, we have seen a dramatic improvement in the methodological quality of reporting trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bent-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bent 2006</LINK>). Of the seven risk criteria (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>), all were reported 'low risk of bias' save one ('Blinding of outcome assessment'), which was reported as 'unknown'.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2004</LINK>, a systematic review of proprietary Permixon®, reported improvements in the IPSS for SR and placebo (4.78 and 4.54 points, respectively), but the comparison was not significant (P &gt; 0.05), as well as indirect. Boyle also reported both arms improved peak urine flow (Permixon® 1.02 mL/s versus placebo 1.20 mL/s) from baseline, but the comparison favored placebo (P = 0.04). In our meta-analysis of four trials (none of which used Permixon®) and 736 men, the comparison favored placebo as well (MD 0.18 mL/s, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.89; I<SUP>&#8322;</SUP> = 0%) but was not significant. Both <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Maccagnano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maccagnano 2006</LINK> claimed the efficacy of Permixon® by its comparative effectiveness to &#945;-blockers and 5&#945;-reductase inhibitors.

<P>
<I>Serenoa repens</I> is a widely used in Europe and the US to treat lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Our conclusion that SR, even at escalating doses, is not superior to placebo, is based on two high quality, clinical trials, one with a follow-up of six years.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-01 08:57:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>We do not know if our conclusions are generalizable to proprietary products of <I>Serenoa repens</I>, such as Permixon® or Prostagutt® forte. Nonstandarization is a long-recognized problem of phytotherapeutic products, and that includes SR (<LINK REF="REF-Habib-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habib 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 1996</LINK>). Future research needs are that RCTs using branded SR have a follow-up of at least one year, are methodologically sound, well powered, use validated, symptom-scale scores, and most importantly, have a placebo arm.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-12-19 11:16:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Feedback: Quality of a herbal medicinal product is essential. Both the safety profile and the efficacy of a multi-component herbal medicinal product are irrevocably linked to quality. Quality should be assessed according to the monographs reported in the European Pharmacopoeia or in other Pharmacopoeias or pharmaceutical reference books [1, 2]. These record the methods to define the quality of multi-component herbal drugs and also of defined selected extracts, according to classification of active constituents, pharmacologically active markers and quality markers [3, 4]. Additionally, pharmacopeial methods are fully validated to perform correctly under the given analytical proceedings irrespectively of the environment where they are performed (ICH guideline Q2(R1); <A HREF="http://www.ich.org">www.ich.org)</A>.</P>
<P>Quality of a defined multi-component herbal extract is strictly related to the quality of the botanical source (herbal drug) defined by the botanical name of the plant according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author) and the part used (e.g. leaf, root or fruit). In addition other factors should be considered such as the method of preparation (extraction process, solvents used; solubility and stability of the plant constituents), the drug extract ratio (DER), time and temperature operations, which could be crucial not only for safety but also for the efficacy of the product [5-8]. Ideally, in analogy with the analytical procedures for testing, also the production-process should be fully validated, in order to guarantee consistency of the final product, as far as possible.</P>
<P>For these reasons the final mix of constituents in a multi-component extract may exert different activities and in some circumstances, may even have a different safety profile from another type of extract, that is derived from the identical herb. These facts are taken into consideration and documented for well-defined herbal extracts in a new series of published European Community Monographs, authorised by the EMEA [9]. It is noteworthy that, among the various types of plant products, e.g. food and botanical products, on the world market, only Herbal Medicinal Products are produced under rigid quality systems, such as Good Sourcing Practices (GSP), Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices (GFCP), Good Processing Practices (GPP), as well as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). As a consequence the quality can be assessed and the final product can be considered reproducible.</P>
<P>According to the above arguments, it is crucial to realise, that the identical botanical source cannot guarantee the bioequivalence of its various multi-component extracts and of the resulting different Herbal Medicinal Products. The situation in the Cochrane review on Serenoa repens [10] leaves no doubt, that various different Serenoa extracts (not always defined) and their subsequently varying final medicinal products, have been summarised, then analysed, in order to obtain the final conclusions of the review. This left the reader to assume, that both comparable (bioequivalent) and non-comparable products were included and compared in this study, in spite of the fact, that they might have exerted different, e.g. non-comparable safety and/or efficacy profiles.</P>
<P>Considering statements and definitions mentioned above, the Cochrane Review on <I>Serenoa repens</I> [10] has been evaluated by the contributors to the present 'Letter to the editor.' Four in part-related problems were encountered. In the following four comments, these problems have been addressed.</P>
<P>Comment 1. Problem, missing conclusion regarding studies with a positive control Serenoa alone, was compared in 4 of the 30 investigated clinical trials with known BPH drugs, such as Finasteride, Tamsulosin and Gestonorone caproate as positive controls. Reported in the review were a few minor differences and many comparable results for the various evaluated symptoms and no difference for the overall urinary symptom scores, between treatments with either Serenoa extract or these BPH drugs in different studies with up to 1098 patients. This apparently demonstrated, that the efficacy of these drugs was not different from that of the Serenoa products. Selected results are shown here, to exemplify the commentary: 1 study compared Serenoa to finasteride (MD, mean difference, -0,40 Points, 95% CI -0.57 to 1.37, P &gt; 0.05); 2 studies compared Serenoa to tamsulosin (WMD, weighted mean difference, -0.52 points, 95% CI -1.91 to 0.88, P &gt; 0.05).</P>
<P>The reader of the review, even without being in the position to repeat the full statistical analysis, could conclude, that efficacy of Serenoa should be similar or comparable to these BPH drugs. The final statement of the authors, that "Sereoa is not different from placebo", is in clear contradiction to these reports. This contradiction has not been addressed, nor discussed, by the authors of the review.</P>
<P> Conclusion to comment 1</P>
<P>Contradictions described here, unless resolved, prohibit a final conclusion about the efficacy of <I>Serenoa repens</I> products.</P>
<P> Comment 2. Problem, chemical complexity of a multi-component plant-extract; 'non-equivalence' of analysed products The authors of the review appear to have treated the various Serenoa fruit preparations, derived from different extracts, used in the 30 clinical trials, which they analysed, as if these extracts were identical single chemical entities. i.e. the authors appear not to have considered in their analysis, that components of different multi-component preparations vary, according to their extraction procedure, the solvent used, the drug-extract-ratio, the total constituents probably vary, the co-active constituents probably vary and the standardization can vary. Thus the doses can vary.</P>
<P> The authors have stated in the review, that "of the 15 trials (in true only 14 appeared to have been actually analysed in the review), that were placebo-controlled and compared to <I>Serenoa repens</I> monotherapy, 7 utilized the commercialized Permixon®, which assured that our comparators were equivalent" [page 13]. Thus the reader may conclude, that 7 out of 14 placebo-controlled trials were included in this analysis, that were 'non-equivalent' (i.e. 50% of the comparators). This causes concern about the validity of the authors' statement as well as the authors' conclusions.</P>
<P> Comment 3. Problem, variation of dose</P>
<P>The dosage relates directly to the composition of a multi-component extract (see comment 2 as well). Thus, the dosage between studies can vary, even if identical amounts are given. Naturally, the dosage must also vary, if the administered amount differs. The 'daily dose' of an extract administered, varied from study to study, in the 30 studies analysed: from 20 drops, 100 mg, 160 mg, 212 mg, 286 mg, 320 mg (a number of studies), 480 mg up to 640 mg, mostly applied in two portions. There was no statistical evaluation in the review taking these different dosages that were used in the 30 clinical trials, into account.</P>
<P> The BPH treatments using non-identical Serenoa preparations at strongly varying dosages, were summarized and investigated in the review, as if identical treatments with defined dosages, had been used. This is, as if one would assume, that apples, pears and even lemons will taste the same, merely because they are round.</P>
<P> Conclusion to comments 2 and 3</P>
<P>The statistical comparative analysis by the authors of the review, focuses on clinical symptom-scores of BPH in 30 trials, but they have omitted to fully address the consequences of analysing heterogenous Serenoa preparations administered in heterogenous dosage schemes, in those trials. For example the 7 'non-equivalent' placebo-controlled trials should not have been considered as a valid part of a comparative clinical analysis of the placebo-controlled studies.</P>
<P> Comment 4. Problem, studies conducted with Serenoa-containing combination products.</P>
<P> Nine (9) of 30 analysed studies, were conducted with combination products containing <I>Serenoa repens</I> extracts, besides one or more other potentially active phytotherapeutic agent (there was no consideration of the dosage, the various extracts were not defined, in the Cochrane review).</P>
<P> Conclusion to comment 4</P>
<P>These studies do not give evidence concerning the efficacy of Serenoa. Any efficacy or lack of efficacy cannot be attributed to Serenoa, such as would be the case in mono-therapy, but could be influenced by the other plant components in each product. The reader may conclude, that these studies do not qualify for a comparative analysis and cannot support a conclusive statement concerning the activity of <I>Serenoa repens</I>.</P>
<P> Summarising conclusions from comments 1-4</P>
<P> -Of 30 analysed studies, 7 placebo-controlled studies with "non-comparable" Serenoa products and 9 studies with combination products, could be deleted for good reasons, possibly leaving 14 studies for a revision of the comparative analysis.</P>
<P> -The authors final conclusion in this review "Sereoa is not different from placebo," does not appear to have been corroborated by rigorous scientific reasoning. Even without repeating the full statistical evaluation (which appears to be necessary as well), the authors final conclusion regarding the efficacy of <I>Serenoa repens</I>, needs to be reconsidered.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2012-04-02 11:14:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Thank you for your comments.</P>
<P>The reviewer remarks that we are acting non-scientifically by lumping, for example, Permixon® and generic <I>Serenoa repens</I>, is mistaken.  Others have made claims that <I>Serenoa repens</I> (whether generic or as Permixon®) alleviates symptoms associated with BPH. We have merely tested their hypothesis.</P>
<P>The reviewer makes two excellent points on bio equivalency and dosages, and in a forthcoming update we will address both. However, we disagree with the reviewers' suggestion that we should have utilized only the Permixon® trials. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence related to all of these products.</P>
<P>The Permixon® trials, which the reviewer urges us to use exclusively, are of almost uniformly poor quality. For example, the 7 RCTs that compared Permixon® to placebo had study populations of 22, 30, 60, 80, 110, 168, and 215. These trials were conspicuously underpowered, with the possible exception of the last two. Follow-up for the 7 Permixon®-versus-placebo trials, measured in weeks, was 4, 4, 4, 4, 8.5, 10 and 12. Only one of the six Permixon® trials that were compared to an active control (or combination therapy with either Permixon® or the active control) utilized a placebo arm.</P>
<P>The reviewer states: "The reader of the review, even without being in the position to repeat the full statistical analysis, could conclude that efficacy of <I>Serenoa</I> should be similar or comparable to these BPH drugs. The final statement of the authors that '<I>Serenoa</I> is not different from placebo,' is in clear contradiction to these reports." We are not contradictory, but the evidence is ambiguous, as we put it in the review. For example, Carraro [1] (Permixon® versus finasteride) reported a decrease in IPSS symptom scores for both arms (-37% versus -39%, respectively); unfortunately, he did not include a placebo arm. Carraro's trial was certainly well powered (N = 1098), but follow-up was only 26 weeks.</P>
<P>The consequence of the reviewers' recommendation to use only the Permixon® trials would eliminate the highest quality trial of the thirty, and Bent&#8217;s NEJM trial [2] (<I>Serenoa repens</I> versus placebo) is methodologically superior to all of the other twenty-nine. Bent writes "these studies [previous RCTs] are limited by the small numbers of subjects enrolled, their short duration, their failure to use standard outcome measures, and the lack of information from participants concerning how effectively the placebo was blinded."</P>
<P>After 12-month follow-up Bent reported "[b]oth groups also had a small decrease in the AUASI score . . . : the score decreased by 0.68 in the saw palmetto group (95 percent confidence interval, -1.37 to 0.01) and by 0.72 in the placebo group (95 percent confidence interval, -1.40 to -0.04) ('Table 2'). There was, however, no significant difference between groups in the mean change in AUASI scores over time (difference in mean change, 0.04 point; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.93 to 1.01)."</P>
<P>Can these results be extrapolated to European populations using Permixon®? We think so. Nevertheless, we welcome an equivalent European trial utilizing Permixon® when it becomes available.</P>
