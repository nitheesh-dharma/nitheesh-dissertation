<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Family interventions for bipolar disorder</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Drug treatments are the primary treatment for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to manage the disorder. Studies on psychosocial interventions for mental disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety show that they are effective treatments. Reports in the literature suggest that they may be useful for people with bipolar disorder as well. The role of the family is important in the care of people with bipolar disorder, with effective family functioning helping to maintain a person's psychological balance. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of any psychosocial family intervention for people with bipolar disorder and/or their families and carers. Seven randomised controlled trials (393 participants) were included in the review, all of which evaluated psychoeducational interventions. Five studies compared family interventions against no treatment, and three studies compared one type or delivery of family intervention against another family intervention. Differences in the interventions, outcome measures and end points used in the trials did not allow us to perform a meta-analysis. Whilst results from individual studies did not suggest a significant effect for family interventions when added to drug therapy, the studies provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions which can be generalised to everyday practice. Further research using appropriate randomised controlled trial methodology and evaluating family interventions other than psychoeducation is called for in this under-researched and important topic.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pharmacological treatments are the principal intervention for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to control symptoms and maintain psychosocial functioning. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions may help to improve the patient's condition and the course of the illness. Family interventions are deserving of special attention, since they may help to relieve the burden of care borne by relatives and caregivers, which in turn may facilitate the task of supporting the patient. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder compared with no intervention and other forms of intervention. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the electronic databases CCDANRCT-Studies and CCDANCTR-References on 1/8/2007, CENTRAL (2006-3), MEDLINE (2006), EMBASE (2006) and LILACS (2006), and searched the reference lists of included studies. We also made personal contact with authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials. Participants were people with bipolar disorder and their relatives or caregivers; family psychosocial interventions of any type were considered; primary outcomes were changes in the status of symptoms and relapse rates. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Quality assessment of included studies was carried out. The findings were presented descriptively. Where there were sufficient studies, dichotomous data were combined using relative risk, and continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference, with their 95% CIs. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven RCTs were included in the review, involving a total of 393 participants. All of the included studies assessed psychoeducational methods, and one study also assessed a type of systems psychotherapy. In all trials, participants continued to receive pharmacotherapy treatment. Due to the diversity of interventions, outcome measures and endpoints used across studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses for primary outcomes. Five studies compared a variety of family interventions, involving carers, families or spouses, against no intervention, with individual findings indicating no significant added effect for family interventions. Three studies compared one type or modality of family intervention against another family intervention, with inconsistent findings. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>To date there is only a small and heterogeneous body of evidence on the effectiveness of family oriented approaches for bipolar disorder, and it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions to support their use as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Further well designed RCTs should be a research priority. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bipolar disorder is a group of illnesses characterised by the presence of symptoms of pathologic variations of mood. According to DSM-IV-TR, people suffering from bipolar disorder type I have at least one episode of mania, commonly presenting with more than one episode, with or without depressive episodes. In bipolar disorder type II there is at least one episode of depression and one or more episodes of hypomania (never one episode of mania) associated. People may also exhibit mood symptoms that do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder I or II, leading to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed in people who do not meet the criteria for manic, mixed, or major depressive episode but exhibit periods of depressive symptoms and periods of hypomaniac symptoms for at least two years (adults) and no symptom-free period longer than two months. Although bipolar disorder is usually described as a periodic disease, mood liability may occur between episodes and become an important cause of impairment in general abilities with potential harmful changes in the lives of affected people (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalbag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalbag 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Judd-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Judd 2005</LINK>). Consequently it is associated with significant morbidity, psychosocial and laborative maladjustment and high suicide risk (<LINK REF="REF-Judd-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Judd 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder I ranges from 0.4% to 1.6% and the lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder II is 0.5%, in the adult population (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK>). Different ethnic groups do not show differences in these rates (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK> ). Bipolar I disorder affects the same proportion of men and women, but bipolar II disorder is more common in women (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK> ). The first episode in men is more likely to be manic, but for both genders the first episode is more frequently a depressive one (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK>). Divorce rates are two or three times higher among people with bipolar disorder than the general population, and occupational status is twice as likely to deteriorate (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK>). It is estimated that 25% to 50% of all people suffering from bipolar disorder will attempt suicide in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Jamison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamison 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bipolar and unipolar mood disorders may be distinct entities (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1990</LINK>), although this concept lacks consensus. Currently the diagnosis is mostly made according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR. The concept of bipolar disorder has now been broadened and so this illness is identified more often (<LINK REF="REF-Akiskal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akiskal 2006</LINK>). Aetiology seems to be strongly associated to genetic and biologic factors, but the involvement of psychosocial factors is increasingly gaining attention (<LINK REF="REF-Alloy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alloy 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prognosis for bipolar disorder, in spite of continual pharmacological maintenance treatment, is not always favourable. There is evidence suggesting that the course is less benign than previously thought. One study demonstrated a 73% relapse risk over a period of five years post recovery of an episode, and that morbidity appeared to be a more sensitive correlate of psychosocial functioning than the number of relapses (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 1995</LINK>). Psychosocial impairments may persist even when mood symptoms are controlled by medications (<LINK REF="REF-Zaretsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaretsky 2003</LINK> ). Treatment consists predominantly of pharmacological agents such as mood stabilisers, antidepressants and antipsychotics when necessary, sometimes benzodiazepines and more rarely electroconvulsive therapy. Compliance is often a significant problem. </P>
<P>Pharmacological treatments are the fundamental tool in managing the illness, however they are not sufficient to control all the problems associated with the course of the disorder and its consequences in a person's life condition (<LINK REF="REF-Hilty-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilty 1999</LINK>). It is especially difficult to achieve satisfactory prevention of relapse through the use of medication alone ( <LINK REF="REF-Gelemberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelemberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 1995</LINK> ). In addition, the sophistication and complexity of questions linked to human psychological functioning and social performance demand more specific interventions in order to address subtle aspects of the ill person. It is also important to remember that subsyndromal symptoms persisting after the acute episode may be very difficult to manage, even with appropriate pharmacological treatment, and may cause non-compliance, thus impairing restoration of former capacities and wellness (<LINK REF="REF-Coryell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coryell 1993</LINK>). Additionally, it seems to be important with life events and correlated stress in order to prevent the negative impact they may have on the illness, specially regarding depressive symptoms and episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>). There is evidence that stressful events inside family milieu are connected to symptoms of bipolar disorder and expressed emotion is an important predictor of symptoms severity (<LINK REF="REF-Miklowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miklowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2007</LINK>). Bipolar disorder may represent a significative psychologic burden for family members and other caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Perlick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlick 1999</LINK>). Family psychosocial interventions appear to be useful for people with other mental illnesses like schizophrenic disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Falloon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falloon 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomaras-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomaras 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Psychosocial interventions have been used for bipolar disorder since the pre-pharmacological treatment era. In the early days they mostly appeared not to be useful therapies for people with this disorder, probably due to the lack of concomitant medication. However, the course of bipolar disorder has changed, through use of suitable biological treatments, and several forms of psychotherapies and psychoeducational methods are now applied as adjunctive care, with more evident success ( <LINK REF="REF-Huxley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzales_x002d_Pinto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales-Pinto 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>). Different types of individual, group, and family psychosocial interventions are now applied, using a non-specific or a specially tailored design for bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>). Cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, psychoanalytically-based psychotherapy, family therapies (based on different theoretical orientations including cognitive-behavioural, psychoanalytical and systemic theories) (<LINK REF="REF-Mikolwitz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikolwitz 1990</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Huxley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxley 2000</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Reinares-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinares 2002</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Fristad--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fristad 2003</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>), and several types of group therapies are examples of psychotherapies that can be used to treat bipolar patients. Psychoeducational methods may also use different formats according to individuals, groups of patients or family settings.</P>
<P>There is general consensus that bipolar disorder affects relationships in patients' families, and that family relationships also affect the course of bipolar disorder ( <LINK REF="REF-Reinares-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinares 2002</LINK> ). Family interventions seem to be useful in controlling the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Reinares-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinares 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK>). Under the name of family therapy one can find very different kinds of interventions with diverse concepts in foundation. They can operate as direct psychoeducational methods with the explicit objective of instructing patients and relatives or carers about vicissitudes of the illness, or they can be behavioural therapy models with more or less educational purposes, often with communication enhancement and problem-solving training. Alternatively, they can signify efforts for modifications in the functioning of the whole family group, treating them as a system where none is isolated and none is the single owner of the illness, as in the case of systemic family therapy models.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to obtain and summarise all relevant trials that evaluate the effectiveness of all possible different forms of family interventions, according to their differing theoretical basis, for bipolar disorder. Family interventions were understood here to be any type of psychosocial interventions for family members of people with biploar, with or without the participation of the individual with bipolar disorder. It also included therapies with groups of families.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1) To investigate the effectiveness (improvement of symptoms or reduction of relapse rates) of family interventions for bipolar disorder as compared to:<BR/>a) no intervention<BR/>b) other family psychosocial interventions</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating family psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. Specific relevant outcome data from quasi-randomised studies were included. Cluster randomised trials were also considered. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder based on DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, IDC 9 or ICD 10 criteria and their relatives or caregivers. There were no restrictions regarding gender, age, ethnical group, nationality, stage of the disease (remitted or in acute phase), presence of co-morbidity, and use of concomitant medication (as long as these were balanced by design).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included any family psychosocial interventions used for treating bipolar disorder in acute phase, or as preventive intervention in stable participants. Family psychosocial interventions could include any type of psychological therapy or psychoeducational methods for the treatment of bipolar patients and their families or caregivers (couples or group of relatives of a bipolar patient, or group of families of different bipolar patients, with or without the attendance of the bipolar patient),drawing from diverse theoretical foundations. </P>
<P>The term psychoeducation means to teach patients, family and caregivers about the illness and possible coping strategies. Psychological therapies are more difficult to define due to the diversity of theoretical approaches, but generally speaking, mean methods oriented to address psychological problems using a therapeutic relationship. The types of family psychosocial interventions could be: family psychoeducation methods, cognitive-behavioural family therapy, cognitive family therapy, behavioural family therapy, interpersonal family therapy, psychodynamic family therapy, systemic family therapy, a mixed modality between this types (e.g. an intervention mixing psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques). Couples therapy and therapies with groups of families were also included. Family interventions could be administered by psychiatrists, psychologists or other health care professionals.</P>
<P>The meaning of 'family' in this review was an extended one that encompassed people who were closely related to the patient, living in the same home or not, a biological relative or a significant and closely connected person for the patient, including close caregivers. Spouses were considered family. </P>
<P>As specified in the Background section, family interventions were categorised according to three different theoretical orientations, as follows:<BR/>1) Cognitive Behavioural Family Therapy (CBFT) (to include cognitive-behavioural family therapy, cognitive family therapy, behavioural family therapy and family psychoeducation methods)<BR/>2) Psychodynamic therapy (including psychoanalytic psychotherapy, object relations)<BR/>3) Systemic therapy (including structural and post-Milan)</P>
<P>
<B>Main comparisons:</B>
<BR/>1) Family interventions (stratified by category) versus no intervention<BR/>2) Family intervention versus other family psychosocial intervention<BR/>Where further studies become available in future updates of the review, the following additional comparisons are planned:<BR/>3) CBFT versus psychodynamic therapy<BR/>4) CBFT versus systemic therapy<BR/>5) Systemic therapy versus psychodynamic therapy</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>Primary outcome <BR/>
</B>Effectiveness of interventions measured by:<BR/>1) Changes in the status of the illness, as measured by standard scales, such as Young Mania Rating Scale-YMRS, Montgomery Affective Disorders Rating Scale-MADRS, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-HRSD, Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-SADS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-BPRS, Bech-Raphaelson Manic Scale, or any other validated scale; for studies where subjects are in the acute phase of disease or have subsyndromic symptoms in maintenance phase;<BR/>2) Relapse rates, for studies where participants are stable (not in an acute phase of disease).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes:</B>
<BR/>1) Hospitalisation<BR/>2) Length of remission<BR/>3) Suicide attempts<BR/>4) Treatment compliance (attendance at psychosocial treatment appointments)<BR/>5) Dropout rates at endpoint<BR/> a) Number of participants who dropped out because of lack of efficacy <BR/> b) Number of participants who dropped out because of symptoms worsening<BR/>6) Employment related events (Work Adjustment Scale, and any other validated scale or objective event like as loss of job, interruption or return to work)<BR/>7) Social and family functioning (UCLA-Social Attainment Survey, Family Assessment Device-FAD, Global Functioning Scale-GFS, or any other validated scale)<BR/>8) Quality of life (SF-36, World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale - WHOQOL, or any other validated scale)<BR/>9) Anxiety levels (post-hoc outcome)</P>
<P>Outcomes would be grouped for analysis according to the duration of active treatment and follow up: less than 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months. For the current version of the review, this was not performed due to limited number of studies and heterogeneity of data.</P>

<BR/>Attempts to contact the authors of included studies were made when any clarification was needed, and to find out about ongoing and unpublished studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>LPJ and BGOS screened the abstracts of all publications obtained by the search strategy (a track record was kept). The articles potentially suitable for the review were obtained in full to assess their relevance, based on broad inclusion criteria (all potential RCTs in family interventions).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>The quality of each trial was based on the criteria of quality specified by <LINK REF="REF-Shultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shultz 1995</LINK>, which measure the following range of factors:<BR/>1) Minimisation of selection bias: a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>2) Minimisation of attrition bias: a) were the withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis by intention to treat?<BR/>3) Minimisation of detection bias: a) were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?<BR/>Based on these criteria, studies were classified according to the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>)<BR/>A-Low risk of bias (all quality criteria met)<BR/>B-Moderate risk of bias (quality criteria partially met)<BR/>C-High risk of bias (one or more criteria not met)<BR/>Trials were assessed independently by two review authors (LPJ, BGOS). In cases of disagreement the third review author (HMC) would be contacted.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted independently by two review authors (LPJ, BGOS) using a standard data extraction form (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). This included data on: methods (generation of the allocation sequence, concealment of allocation, sample size estimation, length of follow-up), participant characteristics (diagnostic procedures, age, gender, ethnic origin, criteria used to classify recurrence, number of patients randomised, reasons for withdrawal from the trial), interventions, and outcomes (specified previously, any other assessed outcomes, other events, length of follow-up, reporting of outcomes quality).</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Review Manager software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to organise and process the results. Interventions were only grouped if clinically compatible, otherwise the findings were presented descriptively.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated based on the fixed effects model, or on the random effects model when heterogeneity is present. An intention-to-treat analysis would be used in which the reviewers would assume that people who dropped out had a negative outcome, except in case there are death outcomes. For all statistically significant results, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to harm (NNTH) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>Continuous outcomes were analysed if the mean and standard deviation of endpoint measures were presented in the original articles. For the meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) between groups were estimated. The weighted mean difference (WMD) would be used if the data were obtained from the same measurement scales, and the standardised mean difference (SMD) would be used if the measurement scales differed. Data on continuous outcomes are frequently skewed, the mean not being the centre of distribution. To avoid this potential pitfall, the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means would be obtained from authors, and b) for data with finite limits, such as endpoint scale data, the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two, was less than mean. Otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Only non-skewed data would be used in meta-analyses.</P>
<P>In order to describe the percentage of the variability in effect that occurs due to heterogeneity rather than to chance, it was planned to perform an I-squared calculation (values greater than 50% to be considered substantial heterogeneity).Heterogeneity would also be assessed by the chi-square test, and was assumed to be present when the significance level was lower than 0.10 (p&lt;0.10). When significant heterogeneity was present, and a sufficient number of studies were available for comparisons, an attempt would be made to explain the differences, through use of subgroup analyses according to clinical characteristics of the included studies, or through the use of sensitivity analyses according to methodological differences in study design or degree of control over bias (e.g. allocation concealment). </P>

<B>Results of the search </B>
<BR/>Electronic searches from all databases generated 1892 references, most of which were excluded because they did not cover the subject of our study, based on scrutiny of the title alone or after reading the abstract. From the search, 20 studies were considered potentially relevant, and articles were obtained and scrutinised. Nine studies did not meet the inclusion criteria, and are described in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. Two studies are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 2006a</LINK>).

<B>
<I>Participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>The total number of participants in included trials was 393, of whom 84 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>), were spouses or caregivers (generally relatives). All participants were adults, with ages ranging from 18 to 62 years. Further information on characteristics of the participants is presented in the Characteristics of included studies table. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Interventions</I>
</B>
<BR/>Experimental family interventions were largely psychoeducational treatments for patients with their families, or for the families without participation of the patient. One intervention, Problem Centered Systems Therapy for the Family, was not specifically psychoeducational (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK>). Patients in experimental and control groups received concurrent pharmacological treatment. </P>
<P>1) Family Focused Therapy (FFT): Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>) used FFT as the experimental treatment. FFT was adapted for bipolar patients (<LINK REF="REF-Miklowitz--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miklowitz 1997</LINK>) from a previous psychosocial intervention model created for schizophrenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Falloon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falloon 1984</LINK>), and is a type of education for patients and their families. FFT consists of three components: psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, communication enhancement training and problem-solving skills training. FFT was administered in 21 one-hour session (12 weekly, 6 biweekly and 3 monthly) in 3 consecutive modules: psychoeducation (7 sessions), communication enhancement training (7-10 sessions) and problem-solving skills (4-5 sessions), administered in the 9 month period following an episode of bipolar illness. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>) compared FFT with an individual intervention, named individually focused patient treatment, in which the goals were to educate the patient about the illness, conduct crisis interventions and reduce ongoing life stress. The other (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>) used a less intensive psychoeducational family intervention called crisis management (CM) as the control condition, with two 1-hour home-based sessions of family psychoeducation within the first 2 months after study entry and crisis intervention sessions as needed during the remaining 9-month treatment period. Both studies were performed with outpatients.</P>
<P>2) Problem Centered Systems Therapy of the Family: This is a short-term, problem-focused, semi-structured family intervention that is manualised and is based upon the McMaster Model of family functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1990</LINK>). The therapy focus is directed to clinically relevant dimensions of family functioning as problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement and behaviour control. This therapy relies on a core set of therapeutic principles tailored to the individual family's problems. The specific problems of the family are determined by the therapist and the family together. The therapy is performed through a progressive series of stages: assessment, contracting, treatment and termination. The number of sessions varies depending on the needs of the family ranging from 6 to 10 fifty-minute sessions. This intervention was studied in <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK> in a comparison with two other groups of treatment that were multifamily psychoeducation and pharmacotherapy alone. Inpatients, partial hospital patients and outpatients were included.</P>
<P>3) Multifamily Psychoeducational Group Therapy: This is a manual based semi-structured intervention developed for the study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK>, which included 4 to 6 patients and their family members above the age of 12 years. The sessions provided information about the bipolar disorder and taught members different coping strategies for common problems. The psychotherapists encouraged patients and family members to share their perspectives on family interactions. It was conducted in weekly 90-minutes 6 sessions, each of them focusing on a specific topic. Inpatients, partial hospital patients and outpatients were included.</P>
<P>4) Couple Psychoeducational Intervention: This is a manual-based psychoeducational intervention for patients and their partners, administered by social workers trained in family therapy. Couples in the experimental group received 25 (10 weekly and 15 bimonthly) sessions. In <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1998</LINK>, this intervention was compared to standard medication for patients only. Inpatients and outpatients were included.</P>
<P>5) The psychoeducational family intervention studied in <LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK> consisted of 12 ninety-minute group sessions for patients' caregivers, and took place in a hospital setting. Relatives of 10 mood stabilised patients were included in each group and the patients themselves did to attend the group sessions. Oral information about the illness and guidelines on its management were provided. Encouraging discussion between participants was facilitated. After each session the participants received a written summary about the topic of the day. The same psychologist conducted all the groups. In the control group patients received pharmacological treatment using the same algorithms of the Barcelona Bipolar Disorders Program that were administered to patients in the experimental group, but the patients' relatives did not receive psychoeducational intervention. Similarly, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>, only patients' partners received a psychoeducational intervention. The partners attended five sessions in which information about the illness, pharmacological treatment and practical advice was provided, and written material was given to participants. Partners' experiences were solicited and discussed in the sessions. The group sessions were conducted by a psychiatrist and a social worker. </P>
<P>6) Inpatient family intervention: this type of intervention was used in <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1990</LINK>. It was designed for inpatients and their families to be performed during the period that the patient was hospitalised through at least six 45 min to one hour family intervention sessions. It was a manual based psychoeducational method, whose goals were acceptance and understanding by the patient and family of the reality of the illness, identification of precipitating stresses for present episode and future, within and outside of the family, elucidation of family interactions, planning strategies for managing stresses and acceptance of the need for continued treatment after discharge.</P>

<I>Settings</I>
</B>
<BR/>Two of the included studies were performed in Europe, one in Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>) and another in Netherlands ( <LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>). The remaining five included studies were conducted in USA.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<B>Allocation</B>
<BR/>All studies included in this review were described as randomised by their authors, nevertheless only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1998</LINK>) provided some specific information regarding randomisation processes. Only one study mentioned allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>), with randomisation sequence concealed until assignments had been made. Regarding allocation concealment, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK> was classified as A ,and all the others were classified as B, for the reason that only the first study described concealment, and the others did not give sufficient information.</P>
<P>
<B>Blindness to Evaluation of Outcomes</B>
<BR/>Four of the included studies reported blindness for outcome measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1990</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>) provided secondary blinded evaluators to analyse information through video-tapes of interviews, and the authors compared the primary and secondary outcome rates because they considered it very difficult to keep the patients' psychosocial group assignments blind. The other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1990</LINK>) simply utilised evaluators blinded to the type of patients' psychosocial treatment group. </P>
<P>
<B>Intention-To-Treat Analysis and Loss to Follow Up</B>
<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis was performed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>), in that all participants randomised were included in final analyses. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>) did not include patients who terminated prematurely in the final statistical analysis, but provided data for them. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>) mentioned the loss of two participants who failed to complete endpoint assessments, but the authors did not clarify whether or not their data were included in final analyses. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>) five of the 19 participants randomised to the experimental group and eight of the 20 participants randomised to the control group were not allowed to be enrolled in the study by the patients (their partners) and they were considered dropouts. One study reported missing data, and there is a mention of an intention-to-treat analysis procedure related to composite outcomes, but not for individual measures (<LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1990</LINK>). With just one exception (<LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1998</LINK>), all reported studies included explanations on reasons for dropouts.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In the process of conducting this review we found a number of studies examining the usefulness of different types of psychosocial interventions as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorders, many of which reported on a modality of family psychosocial intervention. However, the majority of the papers retrieved from the literature were not randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, therefore, only seven trials have so far been included in the review. Participants in all included studies were adults. All seven trials examined family psychoeducational methods, with only one trial assessing another specific type of psychotherapy, problem centered systems therapy of the family, in addition to psychoeducation (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK> ). </P>
<P>The seven studies included in the review presented characteristics of the samples at baseline, described diagnostic procedures, and set out inclusion/exclusion criteria. Moreover, they used relevant outcomes, and provided detailed descriptions of interventions. However, outcomes were diverse and data were often presented in a way that prevented their inclusion for the purposes of meta-analysis, as in the case of those trials that used survival analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1996</LINK>). A further problem was the lack of essential information, as in one study that did not present standard deviations for means of continuous data (<LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1998</LINK>). In that particular study, we were unsuccessful in obtaining further information from the authors ( <LINK REF="STD-Clarkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clarkin 1998</LINK> ). Some outcomes were not directly clinical, for instance, focusing on the illness outcome itself. Other outcomes were not directly linked to any modification in the manifestations or evolution of the disease, such as the patients' and their family members' knowledge of the disease, and therefore we did not include all their findings in analyses ( <LINK REF="STD-Reinares-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reinares 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Findings from individual studies appear inconclusive in demonstrating an effect for family interventions when compared with no family intervention. For studies comparing one family intervention against another type of family intervention, the <LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 1996</LINK> study, a psychoeducational trial carefully conducted over a two year period, presented significant findings on relapse rates, from which the NNT shows that out of every three patients treated with family focused therapy, one less patient would relapse over time in comparison with patients undergoing crisis management intervention. For secondary outcomes, a result with clinical and statistical significance came from <LINK REF="STD-van-Gent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Gent 1991</LINK>, where participants attending for marital psychoeducation had a higher mean score in the anxiety scale than the control group (WMD 0.69; 95%CI 0.05-1.34). This could be considered a side-effect, which might be accounted for by the discomfort induced by the knowledge of the dificult aspects of the disorder, such as chronicity, and the fact that patients can relapse even with adequate medication. This increase in the levels of anxiety might be attributed to chance, and is also acknowledged as a post-hoc finding. Further studies may elucidate this issue.</P>
<P>Results of our review are limited due to the small number of randomised controlled trials on this subject. Additionally, the heterogeneity of studies, specially because they assessed different outcomes, and the lack of trials for each type of comparison performed, were major limitations. Although a non-randomised controlled study might produce useful information in this research field, we wished to follow the standards and criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration, in which the randomisation is a fundamental procedure in a health treatment study. In any case, we agree with the idea according to which the randomisation is really an important step in the trial process in order to minimise selection bias. </P>
<P>In general, there is increased acceptance of the need for adjuvant psychosocial interventions (psychotherapies and psychoeducational methods) added to standard medications in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the addition of psychosocial interventions may reduce symptoms, enhance social functioning, reduce hospitalisations and relapse rates and increase adherence to the treatment of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Vieta-2005-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieta 2005 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2004</LINK>). Results of a systematic review on psychosocial interventions in bipolar disorder ( <LINK REF="REF-Vieta-2005-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieta 2005 a</LINK> ) found evidence of benefits of these interventions in combination with pharmacologic treatment. Furthermore, the same review considers the possibility that different types of psychosocial intevention have a distinct impact on the treatment of different types of bipolar patients. A related observation in another article suggests that mood fluctuations may have multiple distinct aspects in different patients, which might require different psychosocial intervention models in order for the health professional to manage the complexity of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). In other words, bipolar disorder might present in different ways within the same phase or in the same patient, and possibly family intervention treatment could be more effective if these variations of clinical presentation were assessed at the point at which the intervention is initiated. </P>
<P>Family members or caregivers may play a very important role in detecting subtle mood fluctuations of the patient, and could act therapeutically if properly prepared. It is possible that improving the environment, in which family functioning plays a major role, may be one kind of help for patients. On the other hand, stressful conditions in the family context, such as excessive hostility or overinvolvement (also denominated "expressed emotion"), could result in increased risk for patients ( <LINK REF="REF-Miklowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miklowitz 1998</LINK> ). Among psychosocial interventions, family interventions may be as promising as other psychosocial interventions in improving therapeutic outcomes, and perhaps even more so, because they involve the patient's immediate world. Some important authors working in this field recommend the implementation of family interventions for the treatment of bipolar disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Miklowitz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Miklowitz 2006a</LINK> ). Nevertheless, given that studies with adequate methods to produce good quality evidence appear to be the exception rather than the rule in the literature, it will be necessary to gather more data yielded by good quality randomised controlled trials about effectiveness of family psychosocial interventions to provide a sound scientific basis for the use of these interventions. The fact that there are researchers working with samples of bipolar patient in child and adolescent populations is important (<LINK REF="STD-Fristad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fristad 2002</LINK>), as these young people can present with different symptoms, behaviours and responses to psychosocial interventions, and in addition, may be more dependent on their family and its functioning. </P>
<P>The majority of interventions included in this review used psychoeducational methods, and the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, together with the small number of trials for inclusion, means that the evidence is not yet compelling. In the case of psychotherapies, the paucity of data is especially significant. Randomised controlled trials involving more specific family psychotherapies such as those based on cognitive behavioural, systemic family therapy and psychodynamic principles are needed. It is important to stress that although few significant results favouring psychosocial interventions were found in this review, it is not appropriate to conclude that family psychosocial interventions added to pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorders are not useful. Family interventions might be an important means of increasing the effectiveness of treatment for biolar patients, and of helping relatives and clinicians in the task of better dealing with the illness and its consequences. What is clear with this review is that it is difficult to make a precise evaluation of family psychosocial interventions' effectiveness, mainly due to the small and heterogeneous number randomised controlled trials and some of their methodological limitations. It is highly desirable that professionals working in this field concern themselves with carrying out further well designed studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Whilst the addition of family psychotherapy or psychoeducation interventions to medications in the treatment of bipolar patients might be considered good practice, it is important to be aware that there is insufficient evidence in the literature to allow clear conclusions to be drawn on their effectiveness. Therefore, it is not possible to recommend without restriction that clinicians or health policy makers should use family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder or to recommend one family intervention as more effective than another. It is also important to bear in mind the cost/benefit ratio in this type of intervention, not only regarding the economic aspects, but also patients' and their families' affective investment and expectations. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We suggest that researchers should carry out further randomised controlled trials to answer more clearly the questions about efficacy and effectiveness of family psychosocial interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Use of rigorous methods of randomisation, larger sample sizes, standard outome assessments, measurement of adverse effects/acceptability and precise reporting of findings are called for, to produce reliable and applicable information on this important and under-researched topic. </P>

In the Miller 2004 the authors did not mention a confirmation diagnostic procedure after the application of DSM-III-R criteria, but they have considered the sample as composed of bipolar I patients. In another context it should be clarified, but we did not consider indispensable the distinction between bipolar I and II disorders, for the objectives of this review.</P>
