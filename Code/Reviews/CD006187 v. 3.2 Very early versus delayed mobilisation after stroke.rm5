<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-17 10:31:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The impact of very early mobilisation on recovery after stroke is not clear. Care in a stroke unit is recommended for patients early after stroke and results in reduced disability and an increased likelihood of returning home. Very early mobilisation (helping patients to get up out of bed very early and often after stroke symptom onset) is performed in some stroke units and is recommended in many acute stroke clinical guidelines. However, this review identified only one small trial (71 participants) which found no difference in death and dependency at three months between those who undertook an early intensive mobilisation protocol and those who did not. No significant harms were identified and a small reduction in non serious adverse events was found. At present there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effects of routine very early mobilisation after stroke and several trials are currently ongoing.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-17 10:31:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2008). In addition, we searched 25 databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2007), EMBASE (1980 to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2006), and AMED (1985 to January 2007). We also searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched January 2007) and the Chinese medical database Wanfangdata (searched March 2007), handsearched journals, searched reference lists and contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-09-17 10:23:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Unconfounded RCTs of acute stroke patients, comparing an intervention group that started out of bed mobilisation within 48 hours of stroke and aimed to reduce time to first mobilisation and/or increase the amount or frequency (or both) of mobilisation, with conventional care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-17 11:58:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One review author eliminated obviously irrelevant records; two review authors independently applied selection criteria to remaining studies. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome (dependency or institutionalisation) at the end of scheduled follow up. Secondary outcomes included mortality, dependency, institutionalisation, activities of daily living (ADLs), quality of life, time to walking, adverse events (e.g. deep vein thrombosis) and patient mood.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-17 10:30:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One study, involving 71 participants, was included. In this study the experimental group had earlier and more frequent mobilisation than the control group (median 18.1 hours post stroke for experimental group versus 30.8 hours control; 167 minutes of mobilisation (interquartile range (IQR) 62 to 305) during admission for experimental group versus 69 (IQR 31 to 115) minutes control). Fewer patients who received early and frequent mobilisation were dead or disabled at three months, but this was not statistically significant and the confidence intervals were wide (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79, P = 0.42). No significant difference on any secondary outcomes of interest were found.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of routine very early mobilisation after stroke, compared with conventional care. More research is required to determine the benefits and harms of very early mobilisation after stroke. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-24 13:18:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke presents a major global public health challenge, with 5.5 million people dying from stroke each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>) and many more living with chronic disability (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2000</LINK>). We know that treatment in a stroke unit (compared to treatment in a general medical ward) reduces the odds of being dead or disabled at 12 months post stroke (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2007</LINK>). However, relatively little is known about which components of acute stroke unit care may be responsible for better outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2002</LINK>). Early rehabilitation is described as an important feature of stroke unit care (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1998</LINK>), but there is only limited information about what early rehabilitation entails and who provides it. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the optimal amount of rehabilitation that can be provided early after stroke, exactly how early rehabilitation should start is controversial. Early mobilisation (getting patients up and out of bed within 24 to 48 hours of stroke) as part of a rehabilitation package is an established feature of acute stroke unit care in many Scandinavian hospitals. In other parts of the world, patients are restricted to bed for some days (<LINK REF="REF-Diserens-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diserens 2006</LINK>) before mobilisation is allowed. In some cases these differences in practice reflect concerns about the possibility that early mobilisation may have a detrimental effect on the vulnerable ischaemic penumbra (<LINK REF="REF-Diserens-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diserens 2006</LINK>) although there is little evidence to support this view (<LINK REF="REF-Bernhardt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhardt 2007</LINK>), while in other cases they are likely to reflect historical practices. Although very early mobilisation has been recently recommended in a number of acute stroke clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF 2007</LINK>), only indirect evidence currently supports these recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Indredavik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indredavik 1999</LINK>). It is not known whether very early mobilisation independently improves outcome after stroke.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether very early mobilisation (started as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours after onset of symptoms) in acute stroke patients improves recovery (primarily the proportion of independent survivors) in comparison with conventional care.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-17 10:35:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Very early mobilisation was defined as any intervention delivered with the aim of reducing the time from stroke onset to first mobilisation (first out of bed episode), and increasing the amount of out of bed physical activity (e.g. participation in activities of daily living (ADLs) such as walking to toilet, transferring on/off toilet, sitting out of bed, standing and walking). Any form of very early mobilisation was considered irrespective of the number and discipline of staff assisting; and dose or duration of intervention. Conventional care was defined as usual mobilisation practice.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection and identification of relevant trials</HEADING>
<P>We selected trials for inclusion based on the described inclusion criteria. Two review authors (MT and JMC) independently read the titles (and abstracts if available) of all the references identified and eliminated any obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full text for remaining studies and, based on the inclusion criteria (types of studies, types of participants, aims of interventions, outcome measures), two review authors (MT and JMC) independently classified these as eligible, not eligible or unsure. Any trials classified as not eligible by the review authors were excluded. Three review authors (MT, JMC and LL) made decisions about inclusion, and we resolved differences in opinion regarding trial eligibility by discussion between all review authors. If further information was needed to reach consensus, we contacted trialists and attempted to obtain the missing information.</P>
<P>Papers and abstracts in Chinese were reviewed by one researcher fluent in Chinese and with medical training (JW or WZ, <I>see</I> <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>). One review author (MT) assessed a short English description of the decision made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>One review author (MT), who had no involvement in any included studies, evaluated the methodological quality of included trials. This review author extracted information for each included trial about the method of randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and any intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Our primary aim was to obtain standardised data through collaboration with the original trialists. Two review authors (MT and JMC) extracted data from published sources using a standard data recording form. We extracted important quality indicator data such as concealment of randomisation, blinding of outcome evaluation, and intention-to-treat analysis, and graded these as present or unclear. In addition, we extracted data relating to all primary and secondary outcomes of interest, as well as important imbalances in prognostic factors, comparison (details of the intervention in the treatment and control groups, details of co-intervention(s) in both groups) and other relevant outcomes not prespecified in the protocol (for example, exertion).</P>
<P>All the extracted data were checked for agreement between review authors, with a third review author (LL) arbitrating any items where consensus could not be reached. If necessary, we contacted trialists to request more information, clarification or missing data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to compare interventions that commenced mobilisation earlier and aimed to improve the frequency or amount (or both) of mobilisation, delivered by any member of the acute stroke unit staff, versus delayed mobilisation (or conventional care) on primary and secondary outcome parameters. Binary (dichotomous) outcomes were analysed with a fixed-effect model, as odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes standardised mean difference (SMD) with a random-effects model was used to take account of any statistical heterogeneity. We planned to examine the statistical heterogeneity between studies using the I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) statistic. Substantial heterogeneity was determined as a value greater than 50%. We used the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2006</LINK>), for analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of differences in methodological quality (method of randomisation, allocation concealment, intention-to treat-analysis and blinding of final assessment), time to first mobilisation and amount of mobilisation.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients in <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> are shown in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> only those patients regarded as meeting the World Health Organization criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Hatano-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatano 1976</LINK>) definition of a stroke were included. The mean age of all stroke 71 patients was 74.7 years. Fifty-four per cent were male and 87% had suffered an ischaemic stroke that affected the right side in 51% of cases. For 75% of patients, this was their first-ever stroke. Of the common risk factors for stroke, 70% of the group presented with hypertension, 28% with ischaemic heart disease, 27% with hypercholesterolaemia and 54% were either current smokers or had previously smoked.</P>
<P>Stroke severity was measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Brott-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brott 1989</LINK>) and classified as mild (NIHSS 0 to 7), moderate (NIHSS 8 to 16) or severe (NIHSS &gt; 16) stroke. Stratified randomisation was used to balance stroke severity between groups. The mean baseline NIHSS was 10, and 58% of the sample had experienced moderate or severe stroke.</P>
<P>There were no significant baseline imbalances between groups in important prognostic factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes and length of follow up</HEADING>
<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> study, the primary outcome was death at three months. Secondary outcome measures included: serious adverse events at three months (any event that was life-threatening, incapacitating or prolonged hospital admission and patient acuity); non-serious adverse events (all other adverse events that did not meet the 'serious' criteria) at three months post stoke; falls during intervention phase and at three months; deterioration within seven days of stroke onset, perceived exertion immediately following mobilisations; and hypotensive episodes during mobilisation. Deterioration was defined according to the European Progressing Stroke Study definition (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 2004</LINK>), on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, a two or greater worsening in either consciousness, leg or eye movement scores, or a three or greater worsening in speech score. Falls during the intervention (whether serious or non-serious events) and at three months were reported separately. Disability was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) with a score of 3 to 6 indicating poor outcome.</P>
<P>As <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> was a Phase II (pilot) trial, feasibility outcomes included time to first mobilisation and total 'dose' (minutes) of mobilisation throughout the acute intervention period.</P>
<P>Follow up for <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> occurred at seven and 14 days post stroke, then at three, six and 12 months; however, with the exception of disability on the modified Rankin Scale (which was reported at six and 12 months), published data for this study are limited to the three-month time point.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Proportion of people followed up</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK>, 100% of patients were followed up at three months. Two patients (3%) were lost to follow up at 12 months (both in the intervention group).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention characteristics</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK>, the experimental intervention aimed to provide the first mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke. A nurse and physiotherapy team performed mobilisations, which aimed to assist the patient to be upright and out of bed (sitting, standing or walking) at least twice a day, six days per week. Physiological monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and temperature was done prior to each mobilisation within the first three days of stroke. The experimental intervention was additional to conventional care. Frequent mobilisations continued until 14 days post stroke or discharge.</P>
<P>Patients in the experimental group received the first mobilisation at a median time of 18.1 (interquartile rate (IQR) 12.8 to 21.5) hours post stroke. All patients in this group were mobilised within 48 hours. Patients received a median of 167 (IQR 62 to 305) minutes of mobilisation during the acute stroke unit admission. Median length of stay was six days (IQR 1 to 19).</P>
<P>The control group received conventional stroke unit care only, which included a mobilisation component. Patients in the control group received first mobilisation at a median time of 30.8 (IQR 23.0 to 39.9) hours post stroke. Not all patients were mobilised within 48 hours of stroke onset in this group. A median of 69 (IQR 31 to 115) minutes of mobilisation was provided to this group during the acute stroke unit admission. Median length of stay was seven days (IQR 2 to 22).<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-24 13:20:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This systematic review aimed to assess the benefits or harms of very early mobilisation compared with conventional practice. We conducted a comprehensive search of 26 citation and clinical trial registries and attempted to contact researchers in the field to identify unpublished studies. We identified only three eligible RCTs, with two trials currently underway in Scotland (<LINK REF="STD-VERITAS" TYPE="STUDY">VERITAS</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="STD-AVERT-III" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT III</LINK>). The identified <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-II" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT II</LINK> trial (Australia) was a small safety and feasibility study including 71 participants that compared patients who undertook an early (within 24 hours of stroke onset) and more frequent mobilisation protocol with patients who commenced usual care mobilisation later. However, the majority of patients in both groups were mobilised within 48 hours of stroke. In the included study, which was of high methodological quality, there was no difference found in death and disability between groups, no significant harms were identified and the only significant benefit identified was a lower rate of non-serious adverse advents in the very early mobilisation group. Given these results, there is insufficient evidence of benefit or harm to recommend commencing mobilisation within 48 hours after stroke.</P>
<P>Clearly there is research interest in this field, with 39 relevant trials identified. Despite this significant body of potentially relevant research, very few studies met the inclusion criteria. One of the major problems we identified during our search for relevant research, was that the term 'early rehabilitation' was used to define interventions spanning a wide time interval. For example, some authors used the term 'early' to describe an intervention that commenced within 48 hours post stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Xue-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 2004</LINK>), while other authors described interventions commencing within three months of stroke as 'early' interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2002</LINK>). It is likely that what clinicians and researchers consider as early rehabilitation is strongly dependent on when rehabilitation usually commences within their healthcare system. This may vary considerably between countries.</P>
<P>The most common reason for trial exclusion in this review was that the mobilisation interventions in the experimental group commenced more than 48 hours after stroke symptom onset, with over 140 studies in this category. Also, a few studies failed to detail the time from stroke onset, instead noting time from admission (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Asberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Asberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gao 2001</LINK>). Given that it can take patients hours or even days to reach hospital following a stroke, these studies failed to provide a precise time point from stroke onset to commencing intervention and consequently the trials could not be included. Other studies provided insufficient information about the timing of the intervention to allow confirmation that the trial met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hamrin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hamrin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raicevic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Raicevic 2000</LINK>). Author contact has been attempted for these studies and we are awaiting responses. Finally, poor definition of the intervention content and dose was also a problem in this review. It was not uncommon to find interventions only broadly defined with limited information about how much mobilisation was delivered by whom, how often and over what time frame (days/weeks). Once again, we have attempted to contact the authors to seek further information and await a response.</P>
<P>We recommend that researchers and clinicians move to using a common terminology. We have proposed the term 'very early' rehabilitation used to indicate interventions commencing within two days, and 'early' as those commencing three to seven days following stroke onset (<LINK REF="REF-Bernhardt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhardt 2007</LINK>). In this time-critical field of research, it is also important that researchers clearly define when interventions commenced (hours) and that the time is estimated from the start of stroke symptom onset.</P>
<P>Our review identified a substantial number of trials (51 RCTs, 6596 participants) from China that addressed the topic of early rehabilitation following stroke. We understand that current usual practice in many places in China is for little or no organised rehabilitation to be provided to patients following stroke. It is therefore likely that these trials, many of which have been undertaken over the past five years, reflect increasing interest in the provision of rehabilitation to people with stroke. Unfortunately, all the 19 relevant trials identified in this review failed to meet the inclusion criteria because they provided either a complete multidisciplinary rehabilitation program or package (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Xue-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 2004</LINK>) which may or may not include a mobilisation component, and compared this with no rehabilitation, or did not provide details of the time of commencement of mobilisation (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>). In view of this rapidly growing body of Chinese research and the difficulties associated with acquisition and translation of Chinese research, forming partnerships with Chinese researchers on the topic of early rehabilitation would be beneficial.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-09-17 11:29:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is insufficient evidence regarding the benefits or harms of very early mobilisation after stroke to make any recommendation on the practice. This review found no evidence to suggest that the practice should be discontinued in countries where very early mobilisation is a well established part of stroke unit care (<LINK REF="REF-Indredavik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indredavik 1999</LINK>). However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the practice should be adopted more broadly.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-17 11:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Larger, high-quality trials of very early mobilisation are needed before any clear indication about the harms and benefits of the practice can be established. These studies need to clearly define the timing of commencement of mobilisation interventions, and timing should be provided from time of stroke symptom onset, not admission. Researchers and journal editors must ensure publications fulfil CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) with adequate description of the experimental and control interventions. <LINK REF="STD-AVERT-III" TYPE="STUDY">AVERT III</LINK>, a large (2104 participants) multicentre trial of very early mobilisation versus standard care is currently ongoing with results not expected until early 2011. This and related trials are likely to make a considerable contribution to our understanding of the implications of very early mobilisation on stroke patient outcome.</P>
