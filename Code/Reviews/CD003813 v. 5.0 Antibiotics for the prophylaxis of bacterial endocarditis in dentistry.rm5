<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:03:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, has been produced to determine whether people at increased risk of bacterial endocarditis, a severe infection or inflammation of the lining of the heart chambers, should routinely take antibiotics before invasive dental procedures in order to reduce the incidence of endocarditis, the number of deaths, and the amount of serious illness this group of people experiences.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Bacterial endocarditis (BE) is a rare disease, it is generally accepted that 10 out of 100,000 people will suffer from it each year. The infection often occurs on previously damaged or malformed areas of the heart. It is usually treated with antibiotics, however BE is a life-threatening condition and up to 30% of people who suffer from it die, even with antibiotic treatment.</P>
<P>It is thought that invasive dental procedures may cause BE in people who are at risk of developing it. It is not known how many cases of BE (if any) are directly caused this way. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, which is the presence of bacteria in the blood, and although it is usually dealt with quickly by the body&#8217;s immune system, it has been believed that bacteraemia may lead to BE in a few at risk people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that before undergoing invasive dental procedures, people at high risk of BE should be given antibiotics in order to reduce the possibility of BE occurring. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required for any interventional procedure, either dental or surgical.</P>
<P>Some authorities have questioned the routine use of antibiotics, arguing that overprescription has resulted in the emergence of resistance of many organisms to common antibiotics, and also that the occasional adverse effects of antibiotics (severe allergic reactions) may outweigh the potential benefits.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of January 2013.</P>
<P>The objective was to determine whether preventive (prophylactic) use of antibiotics, compared to no antibiotics or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences the numbers of deaths, serious illness or incidence of endocarditis.</P>
<P>One study was included in this review, which compared the treatment of people at high risk of endocarditis who did develop BE and a group of people at high risk of endocarditis who did not develop BE. The study was an observational case-control study based in the Netherlands which looked at information about 349 people who contracted BE over a specific two year period. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted BE. All those participating in the study had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared with regard to who had received preventive antibiotics before these procedures and those who did not.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>It is unclear whether taking antibiotics as a preventive measure before undergoing invasive dental procedures is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk.</P>
<P>No studies were located that assessed numbers of deaths, serious adverse events requiring hospital admission, other adverse events, or cost implications of treatment.</P>
<P>There is a lack of evidence to support previously published guidelines in this area. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of preventive antibiotic treatment with their patients before a decision is made about prescribing it.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Although external factors relating to the study, such as inclusion of relevant participants and well defined parameters, were good, overall the observational and retrospective nature of the design of the study conferred a substantial risk of bias.</P>

<P>Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:00:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Richard J Oliver">
<P>To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:54:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/">http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/</A>). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:54:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic, compared to no such administration, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those individuals at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received or not. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who developed endocarditis.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over two years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines, and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxies). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days, and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:55:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Richard J Oliver">
<P>There remains no evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure.

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-09 14:50:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:04:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 10:59:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infective endocarditis is a rare disease caused by infected vegetations (growths), which often occur on previously damaged or congenitally malformed cardiac valves or endocardium (heart chamber lining). The infecting organisms are usually bacteria but less commonly are fungi, particularly of the Candida species, which may enter the blood via a number of portals. Bacterial endocarditis (BE) is infective endocarditis caused by bacteria which enter the blood (bacteraemia). Bacteria may enter the blood through a variety of portals but especially mucosal surfaces. The gingiva and periodontal ligament, which surrounds all teeth, are almost constantly experiencing a degree of inflammation and as such are a potential point of entry for bacteria within the blood. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that everyday activities such as toothbrushing cause bacteraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a generally accepted incidence of BE of approximately 10 per 100,000 of the population per year. Though rare, it is a life-threatening condition with a mortality of up to 30%, even with antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Delahaye-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delahaye 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Netzer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Netzer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verheul-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verheul 1993</LINK>). In the past the majority of patients who developed endocarditis had a known pre-existing cardiac defect. More recently, however, this trend has shifted with nearly half of the cases of endocarditis having no known previous cardiac disease (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoen 2006</LINK>). Common cardiac conditions that put people at risk include previous endocarditis, prosthetic heart valves, valvular stenosis, ventricular septal defect and valvular damage following rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="REF-Danchin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danchin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farook-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farook 2012</LINK>). People with some of these conditions have a higher risk of developing endocarditis, namely those with previous endocarditis and prosthetic heart valves (<LINK REF="REF-Durack-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durack 1994</LINK>). The above conditions either cause changes in the surface of the heart lining (endocardium) or changes in the blood flow, which damage the endocardium and enable organisms in the blood to adhere and multiply forming bacterial vegetations. This leads to a severe systemic illness as well as having direct effects on the functioning of the heart. Fragments of the vegetations may break away and become lodged elsewhere in the circulation (embolism).</P>
<P>The incidence of BE is low and the proportion of cases arising as a result of dental treatment is arguable, estimated to be as low as 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Gendron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gendron 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunneroth-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunneroth 1984</LINK>) and as high as 64% of cases of BE (<LINK REF="STD-Bennis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennis 1995</LINK>). Although dental procedures are commonly implicated in the causation of endocarditis, the number of cases where the temporal relationship can be demonstrated ranges between only 4% and 7.5% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Gendron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gendron 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:02:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to BE. There has previously been a well established practice of administering antibiotics, typically penicillins, to individuals who are at risk of developing BE prior to procedures during which a bacteraemia may develop. Early guidelines supported this practice (<LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EWP-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">EWP 1993</LINK>). The rationale for this was that a high circulating dose of antibiotic will prevent the development of an infected vegetation on damaged endocardium and thus prevent endocarditis. However, since the publication of the first version of this review in 2004, some authorities have questioned the routine use of antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Strom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strom 1998</LINK>), arguing that the adverse effects of antibiotics may outweigh the potential benefits. For example, in France, one study stated that patients receiving penicillin were five times more likely to die from an anaphylactic (allergic) reaction than from endocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Bor-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bor 1984</LINK>), however this study only considered people with mitral valve prolapse who are not at greatly increased risk of endocarditis. Across Europe, the US and Australia there have been radical changes to the guidelines, moving away from giving antibiotics to all at risk patients to only advising that they are given to those at high risk (<LINK REF="REF-Farook-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farook 2012</LINK>). The definition of 'high risk' varies across American, European and Australian regulatory bodies. More recently, in England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance that was more restrictive, stating that no antibiotics were required for any interventional procedure (dental or other surgical site) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Despite marked reductions in antibiotic prophylaxis for BE over the past 10 years, no increase in its incidence has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornhill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornhill 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:04:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been a key strategy for preventing BE for several decades, and remains so in many parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Thornhill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornhill 2011</LINK>). Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of BE is not in question; without antibiotic therapy, infective endocarditis is fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Durack-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durack 1994</LINK>). However, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of BE remains controversial.</P>

<P>To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Harms</HEADING>
<P>If there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness, and there was evidence from these or case-control studies suggesting that prophylaxis with antibiotics reduced the incidence of endocarditis, then the following would have also been assessed: whether the harms of prophylaxis with single antibiotic doses such as with penicillin (amoxicillin 2 g or 3 g) before invasive dental procedures, compared with no antibiotic or placebo, in people at high risk of endocarditis did not differ from the benefits in prevention of endocarditis.</P>

<P>Study titles and abstracts obtained from the search were screened for inclusion independently by two review authors. The review authors were not blinded to the authors, institution or journal. Full text papers that were retrieved were similarly screened for inclusion independently by two review authors. The inclusion criteria were as stated above. Disagreements over inclusion were resolved by discussion; if agreement could still not be reached it was intended that the paper would be taken to a third party, but this did not occur.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data and quality information were independently extracted by two review authors onto a custom designed data collection form. Briefly, in addition to bibliographic details of the paper, the key items of data were the study design, country of origin, details of the antibiotic intervention, study population details including risk factors and type of dental procedure. The outcome data collected from RCTs and CCTs included number of deaths; number of hospital admissions; the number of serious illnesses that would be expected to result in hospital admission; the number of cases of endocarditis; any other adverse events noted; and the number of people originally randomised to each group. The outcome data collected from cohort studies would have included the same information as for RCTs plus adjusted odds ratios or risk ratios and information on which factors were adjusted for. The outcome data collected from case-control studies included the adjusted odds ratio of a person at high risk of endocarditis having had antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dentistry before either developing endocarditis (cases) or not (controls). Authors were contacted for further details of their studies as well as to assess inclusion, where necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study quality</HEADING>
<P>Included studies were to be ranked according to study design: RCT, CCT, cohort study, case-control study.</P>
<P>All included studies were assessed for risk of bias by two review authors using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. Domains assessed for each included study are: sequence generation, allocation concealment, confounding, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, risk of selective outcome reporting, and risk of other potential sources of bias. For the primary outcome the following factors have been identified as important confounders; other sources of fluoride, social class; ethnicity and residential history while the use of other fluoride sources is the only confounder considered to be relevant to the secondary outcome.</P>
<P>A description of the risk of bias domains was tabulated for each included trial, along with a judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>A summary assessment of the risk of bias for the primary outcome (across domains) across studies would have been undertaken (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=06879747091072257283120228130046&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>) had data allowed. Within a study, a summary assessment of low risk of bias was given when there was a low risk of bias for all key domains, unclear risk of bias when there was an unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains, and high risk of bias when there was a high risk of bias for one or more key domains.</P>
<P>Where data appeared ambiguous or incomplete, the study authors would have been contacted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>It was planned that data on the number of patients with each outcome event, by allocated treatment group (RCTs) or quantile (cohort studies), would be sought. We aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome (separately) across RCTs, CCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies in a random-effects meta-analysis as an odds ratio (the ratio of odds in the prophylaxis group to the odds in the no prophylaxis group), since the odds ratio is the only good measure of association that works across prospective studies and case-control studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>). Heterogeneity between trial results was to be tested for using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, and considered significant where P value &lt; 0.1. For case-control studies it was planned that the odds of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment in the previous three months for cases and controls would not be pooled with data from other types of studies. It was planned that if harm data were collected they would be tabulated according to study design, but not pooled.</P>
<P>For amoxicillin, if sufficient data were available, then the interventions of 2 g and 3 g amoxicillin would be considered separately. Also, if appropriate, subgrouping would be used to explore the effects of different underlying causes of at risk and high risk status for endocarditis, and of different invasive dental techniques.</P>
<P>It was also planned that sensitivity analysis would be carried out on any pooled analyses, removing studies where there appeared to be significant differences in risk factors for endocarditis between the groups compared and where this had not been adequately adjusted for.</P>

<P>A total of 1390 references were identified by the above search strategy. Assessment of the titles and abstracts, where available, resulted in 122 references of potential relevance; all of which were obtained in full text (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). A further 86 were rejected since they were clearly discussion papers, editorials or guidelines. A total of 36 references were assessed for inclusion, in duplicate. Of these full papers, 35 were eventually excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for further details). In particular, one potentially useful cohort study was identified but excluded as it was not possible to separate out those who received prophylaxis, or not, before dental treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Gersony-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gersony 1977</LINK>). Several case-control studies were identified where only some of the cases were at high risk of endocarditis before dental treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Strom-1998B" TYPE="STUDY">Strom 1998B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strom-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strom 2000</LINK>). It was evident that there were many review articles, commentaries and guidelines but few primary studies.</P>
<P>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified, nor were any other controlled trials (quasi-randomised, historically controlled) or cohort studies identified. Three case-control studies were initially included (<LINK REF="STD-Imperiale-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Imperiale 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacassin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lacassin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Meer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Meer 1992</LINK>) however on discussion with editors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group it was decided that two of these, <LINK REF="STD-Imperiale-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Imperiale 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lacassin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lacassin 1995</LINK>, might have been severely biased and so should be excluded. In these studies people with endocarditis (cases) who died, about 20% of potential cases in both studies, were not included. Excluding this group, whose characteristics may have been very different from those cases who survived endocarditis, from the cases but not from the controls (where appreciably fewer people were likely to have died) will have made the characteristics of the two groups very different. Thus only one case-control study was included in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Meer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Meer 1992</LINK>.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Meer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Meer 1992</LINK> study collected details of all of the 349 people who developed definite native-valve endocarditis in the Netherlands over a two-year period (first November 1986 to first November 1988). Cases were eligible if they had previously had congenital heart disease, coarctation of the aorta, rheumatic or other valvular dysfunction, or mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. They had to have undergone a medical or dental procedure that required prophylaxis within 180 days of the onset of symptoms of endocarditis. Proxy responders (spouses or general practitioners) were used where cases were too ill to be interviewed or had died.</P>
<P>Controls had not been diagnosed with endocarditis but had one of the cardiac conditions and were outpatients at cardiology departments of one of five hospitals. Controls were matched for age (within the same five year age category) and had undergone a medical or dental procedure within 180 days of their interview. A random sample of potential controls was drawn, and where there were at least four controls per case all were contacted. Where there were fewer than four controls a further random sample was drawn.</P>
<P>For both groups, all information about invasive procedures and use of prophylaxis was checked with medical or dental specialists and pharmacists.<BR/>

<P>The included study used a case-control design and was therefore at risk of the usual sources of bias associated with this observational study design. The study was judged to be at risk of selection bias and outcome reporting bias (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). There were some concerns regarding attrition bias as cases who were very ill or who died were included in the analysis via the use of proxy responders, however this did not occur for the 53/889 controls who died. In addition, there were concerns that it was unclear how similar the groups were with regard to type of cardiac risk factor, gender, or type of dental intervention.</P>
<P>Overall, the observational and retrospective nature of the design conferred a high risk of bias.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:14:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the included case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Meer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Meer 1992</LINK>), of the 349 people with definite native-valve endocarditis 197 had previous heart disease (proxy responders were interviewed for 10 of these). Of these, 54 had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days, of whom in six a causal relationship was ruled out as it was unlikely that the agent isolated from the blood originated in the area of the procedure. Of the 48 people with endocarditis that were left, 44 had undergone a dental procedure which the paper identified as having a definite (24) or possible (20) indication for prophylaxis (none of these cases had used a proxy responder). Indications for definite prophylaxis were dental extractions and dental root work, while indications for possible prophylaxis were defined as dental scaling.</P>
<P>Of 889 potential controls who were sent an introductory letter, 689 were ineligible (53 had died, 29 had a prosthetic heart valve, 62 could not be located, 102 could not be contacted by phone, and 418 had not undergone an invasive dental or medical procedure within the past 180 days). The remaining 200 were interviewed by phone two to five days later; 181 of these controls had undergone a dental procedure with definite (79) or possible (102) indications for prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Seven of 24 cases and 16 of 79 controls had had appropriate prophylaxis for a dental procedure requiring definite prophylaxis within 180 days.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the cases and controls were not well described as those who had received a dental procedure (rather than a medical one) were not separated out in the publication (the separated data were provided by Professor Van der Meer). The median time between a dental procedure requiring definite prophylaxis and onset of endocarditis was 10 days in the cases, and the median time between a dental procedure requiring definite prophylaxis and interview was 71 days in the controls (data missing for 12 controls). The procedure was apical surgery in one case (4%) and one control (1%), dental avulsion in one case (4%) and 12 controls (15%), dental extraction in nine cases (38%) and 15 controls (19%), dental abscess in one case (4%) and one control (1%), removal of subgingival calculus in three cases (13%) and eight controls (33%), removal of calculus plus polishing of teeth in six cases (25%) and 34 controls (43%), and root canal therapy in three cases (13%) and eight controls (10%).</P>
<P>Including the cases and controls undergoing either definite or possible indication for prophylaxis, and including the four cases and 19 controls who underwent a non-dental indication, 69% of cases were male and 55% of controls. The median age of this larger group was 41 years for cases and 40 for controls (the controls were age-matched).</P>
<P>Seven of 21 cases and 9 of 46 controls had had appropriate prophylaxis for a dental procedure requiring definite prophylaxis within 90 days. Seven of 44 cases and 17 of 181 controls had had appropriate prophylaxis for a dental procedure requiring definite or possible prophylaxis within 180 days. Seven of 32 cases and 9 of 100 controls had had appropriate prophylaxis for a dental procedure requiring definite or possible prophylaxis within 90 days. No information was presented on the adjunctive use of mouthwash.</P>
<P>In each of these ways of assessing the data the proportion of those receiving prophylaxis was greater in the cases than in the controls. Translating the data so that we assessed the odds of developing endocarditis in those receiving prophylaxis compared with those not receiving prophylaxis we find an odds ratio (OR) which was not significantly different from the OR for any of the groupings (OR 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 4.57 for those with a definite indication for prophylaxis over 180 days).</P>
<P>Only four cases developed endocarditis following non-dental medical interventions (within the past 180 days and with pre-existing cardiac indications for the use of prophylaxis), so assessment of the effects of prophylaxis in these cases was not possible.</P>
<P>It was unclear whether antibiotic prophylaxis was effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who were about to undergo an invasive dental procedure.</P>
<P>No studies were located that assessed mortality, serious adverse events requiring hospital admission, other adverse events or cost implications of treatment.</P>
<P>Because no significant protective effect of antibiotic prophylaxis was seen against endocarditis, we did not do a wide ranging search to pool information on the potential harmful effects of antibiotic prophylaxis as pre-specified in the protocol.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 14:50:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review update has identified no further studies meeting the review's inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The one included case-control study, which included all of the people in the Netherlands who developed endocarditis following an invasive dental procedure while at known cardiac risk over a two-year period (24 individuals who underwent a procedure definitely requiring prophylaxis, and a further 20 that may possibly have required prophylaxis), provides no conclusive evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in high risk individuals about to undergo an invasive dental procedure.</P>
<P>A non-statistically significant difference for the development of endocarditis over 180 days in those receiving prophylaxis compared with those not receiving prophylaxis was shown for those individuals with a definite indication for prophylaxis (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.57 to 4.57). If we include data from the two excluded case-control studies (<LINK REF="STD-Imperiale-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Imperiale 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacassin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lacassin 1995</LINK>) (excluded due to inappropriate comparisons, see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) a total of 59 participants developed endocarditis of the 67 people receiving appropriate prophylaxis and 148 people not receiving prophylaxis across all three studies (random-effects OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.15).</P>
<P>There are currently insufficient primary data to know whether antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures in people at high risk of endocarditis does actually prevent endocarditis, deaths or other serious illness.</P>
<P>For the original version of this review we canvassed opinion among some healthcare workers with an interest in evidence based care and a separate group of dentists who had attended an evidence based practice course. Those healthcare workers and dentists who were blinded to the details of the intervention and condition, but shown the level of evidence and the non-significant odds ratio, stated that in this circumstance they would attempt to seek out further evidence (randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies etc) or involve their patients in the decision about whether to use the intervention, or both. However, those dentists who were not blinded, who were told that the topic was endocarditis prophylaxis using penicillin, stated that they would use prophylaxis despite the paucity of evidence and cited medico-legal reasons for this decision. It will be interesting how the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>) is adhered to not just by dentists but other healthcare professionals to which it applies. A recent study examined the legal situation of claimants who had contracted endocarditis against the dentists who had recently treated them (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2007</LINK>). The authors concluded that as long as dentists adhere to current published guidelines there is little course for redress and it is eminently defensible in a court of law.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:16:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the usefulness of prophylaxis could not be established, we have not examined in detail the harms of antibiotic administration; this would be a systematic review in itself. Such a review would, however, be extremely valuable and could potentially be used by a wide spectrum of research workers and other systematic reviews. In the absence of a systematic review on the harms of penicillins, the most authoritative source is <I>Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 2006</LINK>). The range of potential side effects from the administration of antibiotics is vast, largely with a hypersensitive aetiology, but some direct toxic effects may also occur.</P>
<P>The effects of the NICE guidance on the incidence of endocarditis in the UK are going to be monitored using the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Tracked over a number of years and compared with the pre-NICE guideline era the incidence of endocarditis might be one method to answer this conundrum, albeit in a rather crude fashion.</P>
<P>Another under explored area is the cost of prophylaxis, both in terms of finance and health. The financial cost to health services of providing large quantities of prophylactic antibiotics must be weighed against the cost of treating patients who develop endocarditis, which, although significant, occurs in appreciably fewer patients than those potentially at risk. The health costs need considering, particularly the potential harms of the administration of antibiotics compared to the development of endocarditis. The involvement of health economists would be beneficial. This was explored in depth in the recent NICE guidance (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the varying guidelines produced over the years and the recent significant change recommended by NICE, it is important for medical and dental practitioners to remember that patients remain at risk of developing endocarditis. Many patients will develop endocarditis with organisms that have originated from the oral cavity. Whilst there is no evidence that dental treatment is directly related to the development of the disease or not, nor that prophylactic antibiotics can prevent the development of the disease or not, it would appear logical to recommend that the highest level of oral health should be achieved and maintained in at risk patients.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:17:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence is low, coming from a single study at high risk of bias. It would be useful to have evidence about the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis in dentistry from higher levels of evidence. As the incidence of endocarditis is so low, a randomised controlled trial run over two years would require approximately 60,000 patients with a cardiac risk factor for endocarditis to be included (a cohort study over 10 years would require approximately 18,000 patients). Such a trial would require an intense international effort.</P>
<P>A larger, well conducted case-control study might be more feasible but would still require a large effort and multicentre participation. If including every endocarditis case in the Netherlands for two years produces only 24 appropriate cases then the area or time span covered will be very large indeed. Selection of appropriate controls is probably the most challenging aspect; ideally, as in Van der Meer's study, they would have had dental treatment in a predefined time and be matched very closely for sex, age and type of cardiac risk factor. Additionally, neither cases nor controls should be excluded for death or serious illness (use of proxy respondents would be ideal and this would require retrospective identification of controls as well as ongoing prospective identification of cases) and dental records would be available and be explicit about the use (or not) of prophylaxis. Full details would be collected on other factors which may compound the risk such as general well being, coexisting medical problems, socio-economic status and oral health status.</P>

<P>There is general agreement that there is little scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farook-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farook 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornhill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornhill 2011</LINK>). This lack of evidence has led to variations in guideline recommendations with regard to who should or should not be prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis and who is or is not considered high risk for bacterial endocarditis. However, one area where most guidelines are in agreement is with regard to the need for regular dental surveillance to promote good oral hygiene, thus reducing the need for invasive dental procedures and subsequently reducing the risk of bacterial endocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-17 10:41:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Richard J Oliver">
<P>There remains no evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis is either effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people considered at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of penicillin administration outweigh any beneficial effect.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-09 11:18:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) would only be feasible in extensive areas of very centralised and organised health care, due to the large numbers of participants with risk factors for endocarditis required. A well designed multicentre cohort or case-control study is possible but would still require a very large and co-ordinated effort, and a great deal of attention would need to be paid to recruiting suitable control participants. These would be most feasible to perform in an area where registers exist so that it is possible to identify all people with current risk factors for endocarditis, and would randomise them or follow their dental histories in detail and identify outcomes completely and accurately.</P>
<P>A systematic review of the harms and costs associated with antibiotic use is needed, and such a review may be useful to assess the harms for systematic reviews of a number of different interventions. It would be important to assess the effects of type of antibiotic, route of administration, dose, previous history of reaction and duration of use on the side effects and adverse events experienced by people on antibiotic therapy.</P>

<P>All of the 349 people who developed definite native-valve endocarditis in the Netherlands over a 2-year period (1st November 1986 to 1st November 1988) were collected.<BR/>Cases (n = 48) were eligible if they had previously had congenital heart disease, coarctation of the aorta, rheumatic or other valvular dysfunction, or mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. Proxy responders (spouses or general practitioners) were used where cases were too ill to be interviewed or had died.<BR/>Controls (n = 200) had not been diagnosed with endocarditis but had 1 of the cardiac conditions and were outpatients at cardiology departments of 1 of 5 hospitals. Controls were matched for age (within the same 5-year age category). A random sample of potential controls was drawn, and where there were at least 4 controls per case all were contacted. Where there were fewer than 4 controls a further random sample was drawn.<BR/>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-24 16:37:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cases and controls had to have undergone a medical or dental procedure that required prophylaxis within 180 days of the onset of symptoms of endocarditis (cases) or of their interview (controls). 6 of 24 (25%) cases and 34 of 79 (43%) controls undergoing a dental procedure with definite indication for prophylaxis had removal of calculus plus polishing of teeth, 9 of 24 (38%) cases and 15 of 79 (19%) controls had a dental extraction, 1 case and 1 control had apical surgery, 1 case and 1 control had dental extraction, 1 (4%) case and 12 (15%) controls had dental avulsion, 3 (13%) cases and 8 (10%) controls had removal of subgingival calculus, 3 (13%) cases and 8 (10%) controls had root canal therapy. Median time from dental procedure to onset of endocarditis in cases was 10 days, range 0 to 175 days (and for the 7 who received antibiotics median time to onset was 18 days, range 7 to 60). Median time from dental procedure to interview in controls was 71 days, range 0 to 179 (12 missing values ignored), and for the controls who received antibiotics a median of 83 days, range 5 to 151 (1 missing value ignored).<BR/>For both groups all information about invasive procedures and use of prophylaxis was checked with medical or dental specialists and pharmacists.<BR/>

<P>Of 349 people with definite native-valve endocarditis, 197 had previous heart disease (10 proxy responders). Of these, 54 had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days, of whom in 6 a causal relationship was ruled out as it was unlikely that the agent isolated from the blood originated in the area of the procedure. Of the 48 people with endocarditis left, 44 had undergone dental procedure with a definite (24) or possible (20) indication for prophylaxis (none of these cases had used a proxy responder).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Of 889 potential controls who were sent an introductory letter 689 were ineligible (53 had died, 29 had a prosthetic heart valve, 62 could not be located, 102 could not be contacted by phone and 418 had not undergone an invasive dental or medical procedure within the past 180 days), the remaining 200 were interviewed by phone 2 to 5 days later. 181 of these controls had undergone a dental procedure with definite (79) or possible (102) indication for prophylaxis.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Endocarditis was defined by the diagnostic criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Von-Reyn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Reyn 1981</LINK>, and it was checked that controls had not developed endocarditis. Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis was checked with medical, dental and pharmacy staff, and assessed against the Netherlands Heart Foundation recommendations.</P>
<P>7 of 24 cases and 16 of 79 controls had had appropriate prophylaxis for a dental procedure requiring definite prophylaxis within 180 days.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>The published paper provides data on participants who had both medical and dental invasive procedures. The author kindly separated out those who had had invasive dental interventions.</P>
