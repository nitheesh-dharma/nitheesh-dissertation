<TITLE>Ovulation suppression for endometriosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-21 23:38:34 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review of 23 trials involving 3043 women with endometriosis has shown that there no evidence of benefit with the use of ovulation suppression for women with endometriosis and infertility. Endometriosis is caused by the lining of the uterus (endometrium) spreading to a site outside the uterus. It is associated with subfertility and can cause pain during both sexual intercourse and menstruation. The hormone oestrogen stimulates the growth of endometriosis. For many years, the use of drugs such as danazol to stop ovulation and the production of oestrogen has been standard practice in the treatment of pain and subfertility caused by endometriosis. This works well for pain, but does not appear to improve fertility. In fact, as ovulation and periods are stopped for the time of treatment, fertility may be reduced by this approach.</P>

</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-21 23:32:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is determined by the finding of endometrial glands or stroma in sites other than the uterine cavity. The lesions are extremely variable when visualised with the naked eye. They include non-pigmented blebs or vesicles, flame-like echymoses, and classical blue-black powder burn spots. In mildly affected women, the pelvis may initially appear healthy but in severe cases it may be totally disorganised by dense scar tissue formation. The most widely accepted classification of disease severity comes from the American Fertility Society (<LINK REF="REF-Am-Fertil-Soc-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Am Fertil Soc 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schenken_x002c_-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenken, 1997</LINK>). Numerical scores are assigned based on visual findings. Interestingly, this is a relatively insensitive tool for prediction but remains useful in describing the extent of visible pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Schenken_x002c_-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenken, 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the reason why women develop endometriosis is unknown, several theories exist. The most plausible theory is that endometrial fragments expelled into the pelvis by retrograde menstruation (when menstrual blood passes from the uterus through the tubes and into the pelvis) implant in its peritoneal surface (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1927" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1927</LINK>). Other possibilities include metaplasia of celomic cells (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1919" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1919</LINK>) spread by the blood or lymph systems, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1927" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1927</LINK>). More recently the development of endometriosis has been linked to a defect in the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Gleicher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleicher 1987</LINK>).<BR/>Neither the incidence (annual occurrence) nor the prevalence (proportion of the population affected) of endometriosis is known. Estimates have ranged from 1% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Schweppe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweppe 1988</LINK>). The minimal standard for diagnosis is the direct visualisation of lesions at the time of laparoscopy or laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Yuzpe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuzpe 1986</LINK>). The invasive nature of the diagnostic test makes population-based incidence and prevalence studies impossible.</P>
<P>It is widely accepted that endometriosis of sufficient severity to cause pelvic adhesions (AFS Stages III and IV) impairs fertility by interfering with oocyte pick-up and transport. The association is less clear in Stage I (minimal) and Stage II (mild) endometriosis. Although it has been recognised that endometriosis is more prevalent in nulliparous women, it is unclear if mild endometriosis causes infertility or if it is simply a marker for an underlying pathology which itself reduces fertility.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-21 23:39:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Visible disease generally regresses in response to medical or surgical oophorectomy (removal of the ovary or ovaries). It may recur with oestrogen replacement. Most endometriosis becomes inactive at the time of menopause. This hormonal dependency has prompted widespread use of agents which suppress ovarian activity and therefore stop ovulation. In the 1970s, danazol was identified as such an agent and quickly became a standard treatment for pain and subfertility associated with endometriosis. Other agents such as progestins or oral contraceptives, or both, have also been used.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-07-22 21:40:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study were used to calculate Peto odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity (variations) between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points on the graphs and the overlap in their CIs and, more formally, by checking the results of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for heterogeneity between groups was computed and used. If possible, the outcomes were pooled statistically.</P>
<P>One study compared both danazol and MPA with a control (<LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1988_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1988(a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1988_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1988(b)</LINK>). For the purpose of this overview, each treatment arm has been included as a separate 'trial'. However, in order to avoid double counting of control patients in the analysis, the control participants have been divided evenly between the interventions. The design of the study is detailed in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>Data were described per woman randomised in the study. However, in some of the studies not all of the women were 'infertile'. Data were therefore reported, if available, for subfertile couples or couples wanting to conceive only, as well as for the whole study population of which a large proportion of women would have been subfertile. Outcome data was only reported prior to additional treatment regimens commencing as this additional intervention may have affected the primary outcome.</P>

<P>Studies frequently included data on symptoms other than subfertility and reported pregnancies for the subgroup of women attempting to conceive post-treatment. These women appear to have been identified as such after completion of suppression rather than at the time of randomisation. It is thus possible that some women who originally set out to conceive but were unsuccessful did not enter the denominator for subfertile women attempting to conceive. There is no way to determine whether this actually occurred and, if it did, whether it was more or less common following treatment rather than observation. Assuming that incomplete follow up was a feature shared equally by both groups, the relationship between pregnancy rates and the ORs that were calculated would not be affected. However, loss of women attempting but failing to conceive would artificially increase pregnancy rates in both groups. Data has therefore been analysed in this review, if possible, for all women randomised into the study and for those women specifically identified as having subfertility and trying to conceive, or both.</P>

<P>Two studies comprised women who had undergone ablation of visible endometriosis at their diagnostic laparoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 1999</LINK>). In another trial, half the included women had conservative surgery for endometriosis prior to receiving medical treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1988_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1988(a)</LINK>). The effect of this potentially effective co-intervention was therefore balanced between study arms. However, follow up in the second of these trials varied between six and 36 months (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 1999</LINK>). Since the mean duration of follow up was not reported for each study arm, there remains a potential for bias in results due to unequal follow up with danazol versus observation (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 1999</LINK>). Uncertainty around completeness of follow up was a concern in all studies.</P>
<P>
<BR/>"Correction of other fertility factors" in addition to endometriosis was reported in one study. Since this was done for both active and control patients, its effect should not have biased the study comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Bayer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bayer 1988</LINK>). Four studies explicitly excluded other infertility diagnoses from their patient sample (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fedele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fedele 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1988_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1988(a)</LINK>). This selective approach might be expected to improve the response of treated women since only those with endometriosis as their exclusive fertility problem received the treatment aimed at this disease process. If the treatment was indeed effective, it should appear more so in the 'endometriosis only' group than in any other group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK> included women with all stages of disease. All underwent conservative surgery for ablation or excision of residual disease upon completion of medical therapy. Although this may have confounded results if applied to only one study arm, participants in both the danazol and nafarelin arms received this potentially effective treatment, balancing its impact on conception. Bromham et al excluded women with severe disease requiring surgical excision and those with a previous failed response to danazol (<LINK REF="STD-Bromham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bromham 1995</LINK>). While this limits the potential for generalisation of results to such patients, again this pre-randomisation manoeuvre should not have influenced the comparison of gestrinone versus danazol. <LINK REF="STD-ANZ-Zoladex--1996" TYPE="STUDY">ANZ Zoladex 1996</LINK> only reported pregnancy data for the subfertile women in their study.<BR/>None of the studies used a crossover design. None explicitly excluded participants with other subfertility diagnoses. Co-intervention with clomiphene and other subfertility treatments was a concern in three studies with less rigorous concealment of allocation than those described above (<LINK REF="STD-Dmowski-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dmowski 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fedele-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Fedele 1989a</LINK>). Again, since this adjunctive therapy appears to have been equally available to women in treatment and control arms, it should not have affected the relative likelihood of pregnancy. If it was explicitly detailed that pregnancies occurred after the addition of a co-intervention these pregnancies were excluded from analysis. In two trials, &gt; 40% of patients dropped out of one or more treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Noble-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1992</LINK>). Since pregnancy data were reported on an intention-to-treat basis in these trials, the high rate of withdrawal from active treatment may have led to an underestimate of the treatment's true potential. This raises the important issue of common side effects with danazol and other suppressive agents leading to poor compliance. If women who failed to comply with treatment were excluded, to provide an efficacy rather than effectiveness analysis, the value of treatment in a real-world context might be overestimated.</P>

<P>
<B>1) Ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment </B>( <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>)<BR/>From the 12 trials, there were 88 pregnancies in 420 women administered an ovarian suppression agent compared with 84 pregnancies in 413 women receiving no treatment or placebo. The common OR for pregnancy across trials was 0.97 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.37, P = 0.85) for all women randomised, and 1.02 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.50, P = 0.22) for women clearly identified as subfertile (80 pregnancies from 287 women for ovarian suppression and 73 pregnancies from 270 women receiving placebo or no treatment). There was no evidence of clinical heterogeneity between studies with an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 25% and 24%, respectively, for both the total population and subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>The possibility that agents other than danazol may be more effective led to further post hoc subgroup analyses. All studies comparing ovarian suppression agents other than danazol with no treatment or placebo were combined. The common OR for all women randomised was 1.02 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.52, P = 0.91); and for women clearly identified as subfertile the OR was 1.10 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.73, P = 0.69). Heterogeneity as assessed by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 44% and 42%, respectively. There was no evidence of effect with newer agents. Further analysis was done with the exclusion of Vercellini et al (<LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 1999</LINK>). This was done because all women undergoing ovarian suppression had recently undergone laparoscopy with ablation of visible disease. If the ablation had 'cured' them, suppression may have proven less effective than observation because of the period of amenorrhoea induced by treatment. Again the pooled data suggested no evidence of effect from agents other than danazol versus placebo (common OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.88, P = 0.42, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 41%).</P>
<P>
<B>2) Other ovulation suppression agents versus danazol </B>(<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>)<BR/>One study reported on live birth with no difference identified between ovarian suppression and danazol (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.32, P = 0.70). The trials reporting on clinical pregnancies yield a pooled OR for pregnancy of 1.38 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.82, P = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) for all women randomised. This effect was not observed when those women identified as subfertile were analysed (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.94, P = 0.10, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Although these studies assessed different interventions there was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity, as indicated by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. There was no statistically significant difference between the effectiveness of danazol and other ovulation suppression agents for the treatment of endometriosis-associated subfertility.<BR/>When the most widely used drugs GnRHa and danazol were directly compared, the pooled OR for pregnancy was 1.45 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.95, P = 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) for all women randomised, and 1.63 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.37, P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) for women identified as subfertile. This suggests there is evidence of a benefit of GnRH over danazol for subfertile women. This effect was not observed for agents other than GnRH versus danazol: OR 1.35 (95% CI 0.84 to 2.17, P = 0.22, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) for all women randomised; OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.29, P = 0.80, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) for women identified as subfertile.</P>
<P>
<B>3) GnRH versus OC </B>(<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>)<BR/>One study comparing GnRH with OC reported live birth: OR 0.69 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.85, P = 0.46). For clinical pregnancies the OR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.12, P = 0.86) for all women randomised; and OR 0.83 (95% CI 0.34 to 2.05, P = 0.69) for women identified with subfertility, indicating no evidence of benefit of one intervention over the other in this single study.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-22 22:41:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review comparing ovulation suppression versus placebo for endometriosis reports no evidence of benefit on pregnancy outcomes. This is a reasonable body of evidence with little inconsistency and minimal evidence of heterogeneity. Ovulation suppression for up to six months, a hitherto common approach to endometriosis-associated subfertility, has significant costs and side effects. It is difficult to interpret the improved pregnancy results for GnRHa versus danazol given that there was no evidence of benefit in terms of pregnancy outcomes for ovulation suppression versus placebo in women with endometriosis and infertility.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-07-22 22:46:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two of the studies reported live birth as an outcome, which limits the applicability of the results. The other aspects of ovulation suppression are the side effects, not reported in all trials (refer to <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). GnRH analogues may accelerate the rate of bone loss to as much as 1% per month. Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, headache and nasal congestion are also common adverse effects. Danazol increases low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and causes weight gain and oily skin. Progestins may depress mood and libido, and cause weight gain. High-dose combined oral contraceptives increase thromboembolic risk. The 'mainstream' drugs GnRHa and danazol are also both expensive and cost several hundred dollars per month.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-22 22:50:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the treatment of endometriosis-associated subfertility, the combined data from trials comparing danazol, gestrinone, or MPA with placebo or no treatment do not provide convincing evidence of benefit. Trials comparing gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone, or an oral contraceptive pill with an 'active control', with danazol, demonstrate no statistically significant difference in subsequent fecundity between groups. Although ovulation suppression with GnRH analogues did appear to show evidence of benefit over danazol, no recommendation for clinical care can be made as there is no evidence of benefit with any ovulation suppression agent versus placebo. The adverse event profile with any of the ovulation suppression agents makes treatment an unpopular choice over expectant treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-22 22:51:14 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence comparing suppression with no treatment or placebo provides 80% power to detect a benefit of 20% (two tailed alpha 0.05), and consistently fails to do so. Larger trials of this comparison do not appear warranted.</P>

<P>The original review was prepared in 1996. For the update of this review in 2003, three new RCTs were added to the review and all sections of the text were substantially revised. The review was updated again in 2009 with the addition of one further study, and the title of the review was changed to reflect the content and outcomes, that is subfertility.<BR/>
