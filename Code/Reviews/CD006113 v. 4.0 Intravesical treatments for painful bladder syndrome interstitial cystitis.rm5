<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Intravesical treatments for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis(PBS/IC).</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Interstitial cystitis is also known as painful bladder syndrome. It typically causes symptoms of bladder and pelvic pain, an increased urge to pass urine and excessive urination during both day and night. The cause of the condition is not well-understood but it is thought to result from long-standing inflammation of the bladder. Many treatments have been used for PBS/IC and in this review we assess the effects of putting medication directly into the bladder (bladder instillations) to treat it. </P>
<P>We found nine studies that addressed this question, assessing six different types of treatment and involving 616 participants. For none of the instillations was the evidence conclusive. It was most promising for BCG (a type of tuberculosis bacterium) and possibly also for oxybutinin (a drug commonly taken orally to stop unwanted bladder contractions). Another agent, Resiniferatoixin, seemed to worsen pain and increase the likelihood of patients stopping treatment early. Little evidence was found for assessing benefits and harms of other treatments instilled into the bladder.<BR/> </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Painful Bladder Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis (PBS/IC) occurs predominantly in women. It is a poorly-understood condition with symptoms of bladder pain, urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia. Treatments for PBS/IC include dietary/lifestyle interventions, oral medication, intravesical instillations and, in some cases, surgery. Success rates are generally modest and there is little consensus as to the best form of treatment for this condition. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of intravesical treatment for PBS/IC. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (30 May 2006) as well as reference lists of all selected trials. Recognised researchers in the field were contacted for any additional relevant material. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in the review if they had recruited participants with a clinical diagnosis of PBS/IC and if at least one arm of the trial was treatment with an intravesical preparation. Outcome measures were pre-determined, the primary ones being the effect on pain and bladder capacity. Others included symptomatic response to treatment, quality-of-life assessment, economic factors and adverse events. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, then extracted relevant data from the studies. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine eligible trials were identified - six parallel group, one incomplete cross-over and two cross-over trials - with a total of 616 participants. Six trials compared an 'active' instillation with placebo instillation, two compared different types of instillation, and one was a comparison of an instillation plus bladder training versus bladder training alone. Altogether, the review included trials of six different types of intravesical instillation: Resiniferatoxin, Dimethyl sulfoxide, BCG, pentosanpolysulphate, oxybutin, and alkalinisation of urine pH. Confidence intervals were generally wide.</P>
<P>Resiniferatoxin was not associated with sustained differences in the review outcomes reported but pain during instillation and withdrawal from treatment was significantly more common. The data available about Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were very limited but with no apparent differences from placebo. Groups treated with BCG tended to report less pain and fewer general symptoms. Although adverse events were commonly reported, these were no more common after BCG than after placebo instillation. The few data about Pentosanpolysulphate tended to favour the actively treated, but with wide confidence intervals; there was little information about adverse events. Oxybutinin instillation was associated with increased bladder capacity, reduced frequency, improved quality of life scores and fewer drop-outs. Alkalinisation of urine pH did not make any clear difference, but with potentially wide confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Overall, the evidence base for treating PBS/IC using intravesical preparations is limited and the potential for meta-analysis reduced by variation in the outcome measures used. The quality of trial reports was mixed and in some cases this precluded any meaningful data extraction. BCG and oxybutin are reasonably well-tolerated and evidence is most promising for these. Resiniferatoxin showed no evidence of effect for most outcomes and caused pain, which reduced treatment compliance. There is little evidence for the other treatments included in this review. Randomised controlled trials are still needed and study design should incorporate outcomes that are most relevant to these with PBS/IC and should be standardised.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The condition</HEADING>
<P>Interstitial cystitis (also known as Painful Bladder Syndrome) is a chronic bladder condition seen mainly in women (10:1 female to male) and characterised by pain, urgency, frequency and nocturia. There are cystoscopic and histologic features which are said to be typical but in many cases the diagnosis is one of exclusion, having ruled out specific causes such as infection and malignancy. Overactive Bladder (OAB) shows some similarity in its clinical presentation but without the pain, which is the defining symptom of painful bladder syndrome/ interstitial cystitis (PBS/ IC).</P>
<P>The prevalence of PBS/ IC varies between populations and ranges from 8 out of 100,000 in the Netherlands to 500 out of 100,000 in some parts of the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 2002</LINK>). In part this is due to a lack of standardised diagnostic criteria and a wide variation in the investigative steps undertaken to make the diagnosis. The strictest diagnostic criteria are those used by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in their research definition of interstitial cystitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gillenwater-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillenwater 1988</LINK>). This requires both cystoscopy and cystometry to exclude other possible causes for patient symptoms and also describes minimum criteria for age, duration of symptoms, degree of frequency and nocturia. These criteria have allowed a reasonably homogeneous group of patients to be identified for research purposes but there is controversy as to their usefulness for routine clinical diagnosis. A particular finding at cystoscopy is that of Hunner's ulceration which, if present, is an inclusion NIDDK criteria. Distinction has been made between ulcerative and non-ulcerative variants of the condition in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peeker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The underlying pathophysiology of PBS/ IC is incompletely understood and the condition is increasingly viewed as being multifactorial (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 2002</LINK>). A loss of integrity at the epithelial surface of the bladder, possibly due to an infective or other inflammatory insult, is thought to be important along with sensory nerve up-regulation and enhanced mast cell activation (<LINK REF="REF-Sant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sant 2002</LINK>). The end result of this process is a form of regional neuropathy that can have other gynaecological and gastrointestinal manifestations as well as pain and voiding symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Nickel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickel 2002</LINK>). The clinical course of PBS/ IC and the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies in some cases has given rise to an autoimmune theory of pathophysiology.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The intervention</HEADING>
<P>The multiple theories of pathogenesis proposed for PBS/ IC have resulted in the development of a large range of treatments. These have included oral medication, intravesical or bladder instillation therapy, dietary changes, lifestyle interventions, peripheral or transcutaneous nerve stimulation and surgical intervention. Combinations of different treatment methods have been used to improve efficacy. This review will focus on those treatments where medication is administered via the intravesical route (ie given directly into the bladder). A systematic review of oral treatment for PBS/ IC is currently in progress (<LINK REF="REF-Jamison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamison 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravesical treatments for PBS/ IC are listed below, along with the proposed mode of action.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): multiple action, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, collagen dissolution, muscle relaxant, effect on histamine release from mast cells.</LI>
<LI>Heparinoids (heparin and hyaluronic acid): enhances the mucopolysaccharide/ glycosaminoglycan(GAG) layer that lines the bladder, inhibits leukocyte function and migration, scavenges reactive oxygen species.</LI>
<LI>Pentosanpolysulfate: reduces the permeability of the bladder mucosa to toxic urine components.</LI>
<LI>Capsaicin and Resiniferatoxin: de-sensitisation of afferent bladder innervation.</LI>
<LI>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG): believed to work immunologically, on the basis of an autoimmune cause for interstitial cystitis.</LI>
<LI>Chondroitin sulfate: replenishment of GAG layer.</LI>
<LI>Disodium cromoglycate: mast cell inhibition.</LI>
<LI>Lignocaine: direct anaesthetic effect.</LI>
<LI>Oxybutinin: anticholinergic effect to reduce bladder spasm.</LI>
<LI>Clorpactin (oxychlorosene): used originally to treat TB because of antimicrobial properties.</LI>
<LI>Silver nitrate: antiseptic and astringent effect.</LI>
<LI>Steroids: anti-inflammatory effect.</LI>
<LI>Doxorubicin (Adriamicin): uncertain of proposed mode of action.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>At the protocol stage, we recognised that there may be other preparations/medicines administered via the intravesical route which are not listed here. We planned to assess these too, provided that the trial inclusion criteria were met.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effects of medication delivered by the intravesical/bladder instillation route with placebo and other treatments for painful bladder syndrome/ interstitial cystitis in adults.</P>
<P>The following comparisons were made:</P>
<P>1. Intravesical treatment verses placebo or no treatment.<BR/>2. One intravesical treatment verses another intravesical treatment.<BR/>3. Intravesical treatment verses other methods of delivering pharmacological treatment.<BR/>4. Intravesical treatment verses other modes of treatment eg. dietary and lifestyle changes.<BR/>5. Intravesical treatment combined with any other form of treatment verses the other treatment alone. </P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Much research has been focused on a relatively homogenous group of participants who meet the NIDDK criteria. In practice the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the condition is often based on less rigid clinical grounds. Studies were therefore considered for this review if they comprised adults in whom a clinical diagnosis of Painful Bladder Syndrome/ Interstitial Cystitis had been made, with or without meeting NIDDK criteria. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>A trial where at least one of the arms was 'treatment with an intravesical preparation' or 'bladder instillation treatment'. The exact drug or preparation being administered by this route was not pre-specified and there may have been a range of possibilities as described in the protocol background above. Comparison may have been with either a) placebo or no treatment, b) another preparation, or combination of preparations, administered via the intravesical route, c) any other treatment, including an orally administered preparation or d) dietary or lifestyle measures.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<UL>
<LI>The primary outcome measures were pain and bladder capacity. Pain assessment is subjective and relies on patient self-reporting. It may have involved the use of specific pain scores or scales as well as descriptive endpoints. Bladder capacity was assessed in awake rather than anaesthetised subjects using either patient bladder diaries or results of urodynamic investigations.</LI>
<LI>Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported outcomes such as voiding frequency, episodes of nocturia or nocturnal enuresis as well as objective cystoscopic and histological findings.</LI>
<LI>Quality of Life information, both general and condition-specific with data from appropriate questionnaires.</LI>
<LI>Economic outcomes: direct and indirect costs of treatment, formal economic analyses of treatment.</LI>
<LI>Other outcomes: adverse events; any long-term follow-up data; need for further treatment; other outcomes not pre-specified but judged important when carrying out review.</LI>

<P>This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Incontinence Group as a whole. Relevant trials were primarily identified from the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register. The methods used to derive this, including the search strategy, are described under the Group's details in <I>The Cochrane Library (</I>
<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>). The register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and hand searching of journals and conference proceedings.</P>
<P>The Incontinence Group's trials register was searched using the Group's own keyword system, the search terms used were:</P>
<P>topic.urine.interstitial*<BR/>AND<BR/>({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({intvent.chem.drug*}<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the register for this review: 30 May 2006.</P>
<P>The trials in the Incontinence Group's Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL.</P>
<P>Additionally all reference lists of selected trials were also searched. We contacted patient support groups and trialists in the field to identify any additional or unpublished trials. We did not place any limitations on the searches.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Identified trials were selected for inclusion in the review on the basis of appropriateness as determined by two independent reviewers without prior consideration of the results. Non-English language publications were translated. The reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the Incontinence Group's quality assessment criteria including quality of randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment, description of withdrawal and dropout, and intention to treat analysis. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and if necessary referred to the editorial team.</P>
<P>For each eligible study, data relevant to the prestated outcome measures, characteristics of study, interventions and participants were independently abstracted by two reviewers. An attempt was made to contact authors to acquire any missing or unreported study data. In the event of duplicate publications, the studies were treated as a single source of data.</P>
<P>Outcomes were presented for unfavourable events and where appropriate data were combined quantitatively using the statistical program within the Cochrane Review Manager Software. Binary outcomes were presented as relative risks, and continuous outcomes by mean differences, accompanied by 95% confidence intervals. If different tools were used to measure outcomes such as quality of life, standardised mean differences were considered. Crossover trials were analysed in Revman by the Generic Inverse Variance method; mean and standard error of within-subject differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratio with standard error for binary outcomes. </P>
<P>Statistical combination of data was done using a fixed effects model in the first instance. If appropriate, the I squared statistic, in conjunction with the chi-squared test for heterogeneity and visual inspection of the forest plots would have been used to assess heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity existed the characteristics of the studies were examined to look for potential causes. If none were found, further analysis with a random effects model and the use of sensitivity analyses would have been undertaken. When meta-analysis was inappropriate then a descriptive comparison was made instead. </P>
<P>If justified by the number of eligible trials and their participant inclusion criteria, a subgroup analysis would have been performed on those trials where inclusion was based on NIDDK criteria.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Results of the Search</HEADING>
<P>The Incontinence Cochrane Review Group (CRG) search, as at 30 May 2006, yielded 61 references. Forty-five of these were able to be quickly discounted, while another four were excluded after closer inspection. Checking of trial references yielded one further possible study (<LINK REF="STD-Lazzeri-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lazzeri 1996</LINK>) although this too was later excluded. This left nine trials, reported in twelve papers, for inclusion in the review.</P>

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>) some participants 'crossed-over' at the end of the treatment period. We planned to treat this study as a parallel group trial limiting consideration to data before the option to cross-over, but there proved to be too little information provided to allow this. The rest were parallel group trials. Three of the trials had additional publications, the references of which have been included for completeness (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In total there were 616 participants - numbers in individual studies ranged from 21 to 265. The majority of participants were women and ages ranged from 18 to 85 years. Although trial participants were eligible for review inclusion on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of PBS/IC, most trials had recruited using NIDDK criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Intravesical treatment vs placebo or no treatment</HEADING>
<P>There were six trials that addressed this comparison, involving four different preparations.</P>
<P>Bade et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>) compared pentosanpolysulphate with placebo in 20 women with NIDDK-defined Interstitial Cystitis. Ten participants had instillations of pentosanpolysulphate twice-weekly for three months. Follow-up at three months included subjective assessment of response using a visual analogue scale (VAS), voiding diary and urodynamic bladder capacity assessment.</P>
<P>Chen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>) and Payne et al (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>) compared resiniferatoxin (RTX) with placebo. Both trials had multiple arms to allow comparison of different RTX dose strengths. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK> had 22 participants (17 women) all meeting NIDDK criteria. Eighteen received a single instillation of RTX in one of two dose strengths. Follow-up was at four and 12 weeks and consisted of voiding diary, pain score on VAS, scores on validated symptom and problem indices, serum levels of RTX and metabolites as well as biochemistry and haematology results. <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK> had 163 participants (140 women) diagnosed on clinical and cystoscopic grounds with Hunner's ulcers being an exclusion criteria. Seventy six participants were given RTX in a single instillation at one of three dose strengths. Follow-up was at 4 weeks for the primary outcome of a subjective global response score and at up to 12 weeks for other outcomes which included pain scores, voiding diary information and cystoscopy findings.</P>
<P>Mayer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>) and Peters et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) compared Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK> had 265 participants (217 women) all meeting NIDDK diagnostic criteria. Active treatment for 131 of the participants comprised a series of 6 instillations with live Tice strain BCG. The instillations were completed within 10 weeks with follow-up at 34 weeks after starting. Outcomes were: 'response to treatment' - based on a subjective global assessment and stability in medication, pain score, voiding diary data, scores on validated bladder symptom questionnaires.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK> studied 33 women who met NIDDK criteria. Seventeen received active treatment with six, weekly instillations of Tice strain BCG. Follow-up occurred after a minimum of six months. The outcomes reported were mostly questionnaire based including: the number experiencing a moderate-or-better improvement in overall symptoms, specific questions on urgency, frequency, burning, pain and dyspareunia. Bladder capacity at cystometry and a general quality of life questionnaire were additional outcomes used.</P>
<P>Perez-Marrero (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>) compared dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with placebo in 33 participants (30 women) diagnosed clinically and with cystoscopy/biopsy. The cases were described as 'early-stage disease' and excluded Hunner's ulcers or contracted bladders. Participants were divided into groups of 15 and 17, each then receiving four instillations, two weeks apart, of either DMSO or placebo. After a four week washout period the treatment allocation was reversed and a further four instillations given. Assessment followed the completion of each treatment phase and comprised urodynamic assessment, voiding diary and VAS scores for pain, urgency and frequency.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. One intravesical treatment vs another</HEADING>
<P>This comparison was addressed in two trials involving 47 participants.</P>
<P>Peeker et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>) compared BCG with DMSO in a trial of 21 participants (20 women) all meeting NIDDK criteria but stratified into ulcerative and non-ulcerative types. Participants were divided into two groups and treated with six, weekly instillations of either BCG or DMSO. Assessment of outcome took place three months after finishing the instillations and participants were then offered the alternative treatment if they had not improved. The selected outcomes were pain on VAS, frequency and bladder capacity from bladder diaries, before selective cross-over.<BR/>
<BR/>Nguan et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nguan 2005</LINK>) compared instillation of two solutions, one neutral and the other physiologically acidic, in a cross-over study involving 26 women who met NIDDK criteria. The participants were randomised to receive an instillation of either acidic (pH 5.0) or neutral (pH 7.5) solution for a period of 30 minutes. At the end of this time the solution was drained, the bladder twice washed out with sterile de-ionised water and the alternative instillation administered. A 10-point numerical rating scale was used to assess bladder pain (change from baseline) at the end of each instillation.</P>

<P>The investigators studied 36 women meeting NIDDK criteria, 24 of whom were treated with repeated oxybutinin bladder instillations. Filling occurred to the point of first desire to void at which time the catheter was clamped until functional capacity was reached. This process continued on an inpatient basis, during waking hours, for one week. Single days of the same treatment then followed; weekly for six weeks and monthly for three months. The 12 remaining women underwent the same bladder-filling regimen, but with saline rather than oxybutinin solution. The outcomes of voids/day, first desire volume, capacity volume and a symptom score were assessed at six months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Most of the reports identified by the search strategy were quickly eliminated upon review of the abstract and comparison with the pre-defined inclusion criteria. This was usually due to the mode of administration being oral rather than intravesical. Eight further references were then excluded after full review; four did not meet inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Dimitrakov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dimitrakov 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazzeri-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lazzeri 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazzeri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lazzeri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philip-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 2004</LINK>), three reported trials already included (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>) and one was a conference abstract concerning a study from which data has never been published (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation, description of participants and blinding</HEADING>
<P>All of the included studies stated random allocation of treatment with the randomisation method described for four (<LINK REF="STD-Barbalias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barbalias 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>

In most cases the treatment groups were similar although in <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK> the disease duration was longer in the group receiving active treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK> the mean ages of the placebo and treatment groups differed by 13 years, a difference perhaps accounted for by the smaller number of participants receiving placebo (four) compared with active treatment (eighteen). With the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Barbalias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barbalias 2000</LINK>) all specified blinding of participants to allocated treatment. Blinding of treatment personnel was specified in five studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nguan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) while blinded outcome assessors were described in these five and an additional two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adherence to prescribed treatment</HEADING>
<P>All studies described proposed treatment in good detail and adhered to it. The two resiniferatoxin studies both had variation in the pre-treatment given to participants; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK> offered a lignocaine pre-instillation which was used by some, but not all, participants while <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK> used lignocaine pre-instillation in all participants but changed the dose during the course of the trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow-up and withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of numbers of withdrawals from treatment was satisfactory in all the studies and in most cases the reasons for subject withdrawal were well-documented. Duration of follow-up and timing of assessment after treatment varied widely between studies. As expected, the cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nguan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nguan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>) had very short follow-up periods while others extended follow-up beyond six month (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>).</P>

Data presentation was often limited and did not allow easy extraction or adequate analysis. Problems ranged from omission of standard deviations from continuous data (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbalias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barbalias 2000</LINK>) to omission of numbers in treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>) and presentation of outcome by categories other than treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">- Pain (Revman Outcomes 01.01, 01.02, 01.03, 01.04, 01.05, 01.06.)</HEADING>
<P>The effect on pain was reported in all of the five trials, except Bade (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>). Neither RTX (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>) nor DMSO (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>) instillations showed an advantage over placebo. Of the two studies that looked at BCG instillation, Mayer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>) did suggest a benefit from BCG treatment in terms of reducing pain score but this was not statistically significant (WMD -0.50, 95% CI: -1.06, 0.06; p = 0.08). The data from Peters (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) also tended to favour the BCG group, but again the difference was not statistically significant (10 out of 17 versus 4 out of 15 had improvement in vaginal urethral pain: RR 2.21; 95% CI 0.87 to 5.58). The ways in which pain was reported were too different to allow data from the two trials to be combined.</P>

<P>Assessment with either bladder diary (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>) or urodynamic techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) showed no difference in capacity following intravesical BCG or placebo instillation. Urodynamic capacity increased more with intravesical pentosanpolysulphate than with placebo and although, only 33 ml, the extra increase was reported to be statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>). The instillation of DMSO did not increase the cystometric capacity significantly more than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">-Frequency (Revman Outcome 01.10, 01.11. Other data table 01.12)</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was reported in four of the trials comparing intravesical treatment with placebo. Of those where data was presented in a format suitable for Revman analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK> showed no difference between RTX and placebo while <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK> similarly showed no difference between BCG and placebo. In the trial by Bade et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>) urinary frequency was less following pentosanpolysulphate instillation than placebo. This reduction was non-significant as was the difference in frequency seen with BCG instillation compared with placebo in (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Chen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>) assessed nocturia following intravesical RTX and placebo and found no difference. The small reduction in nocturia seen with pentosanpolysulphate versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>) was non-significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">-Improvement in symptoms (Revman 01.15, 01.16, 01.20, 01.21, 01.22 )</HEADING>
<P>The subjective change in PBS/IC symptoms was reported in several of the studies, in some cases as the primary outcome measure. Varying methods of symptom assessment were used. Bade et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>) used a visual analogue scale and found no difference between pentosanpolysulphate and placebo. Payne et al (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>) used a Global Response Assessment scale and saw no benefit of RTX over placebo. Chen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>) reported Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) scores at both four and twelve weeks after instillation as no better than placebo. The effect of BCG instillation on symptoms was assessed with the ICSI as well as by the number of participants reporting a symptomatic 'response' to treatment. The ICSI results from <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK> favoured BCG, although the result was not significant (WMD -0.7, 95%CI: -1.7, 0.3). When assessing subjective response Peters et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) and Mayer et al each reported a trend toward BCG over placebo that failed to achieve significance. Meta-analysis, however, gave a typical estimate of symptomatic benefit following BCG treatment that was statistically significant (RR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.12- 2.99).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">-Quality of life (Revman 01.17, 01.18. Other data table 01.19)</HEADING>
<P>A general questionnaire as well as more condition-specific tools were used in some studies to assess symptoms of PBS/IC and their impact on quality of life. Peters et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) reported benefit of BCG instillation over placebo in all eight domains of the Rand-36 quality-of-life questionnaire but in only two domains, social function and fatigue, were the differences statistically significant.</P>
<P>Two studies used the Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI) to assess the difference between intravesical treatment and placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK> better scores were reported following RTX over placebo at 4 weeks (WMD -2.67, 95%CI: -5.13, -0.21) but this difference was no longer present at twelve weeks. ICPI results from <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK> showed no difference between BCG and placebo instillation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">-Cystoscopic or Histologic changes (Revman 01.31)</HEADING>
<P>One study assessed the effect of intravesical treatment on the cystoscopic appearance of the bladder. Although in the review protocol it was intended that changes on cystoscopy might reflect treatment efficacy, Chen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>) examined post-treatment to determine the degree of resulting inflammation. There was no difference seen following RTX and placebo instillation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">-Adverse events (Revman 01.23, 01.24, 01.26, 01.27, 01.28, 01.29, 01.30. Other data table 01.25)</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of adverse events varied widely between the different studies, due in no small part to the use of different intravesical preparations.</P>
<P>The two RTX trials measured the pain following instillation. The larger of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>) showed pain with instillation to be significant problem while the smaller trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005a</LINK>) showed a trend in the same direction which was not statistically significant. The subsequent meta-analysis of data suggested about a 50% increased risk of pain with RTX than placebo ( RR 1.53, 95%CI: 1.13, 2.07). Tolerance of intravesical RTX was compared with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2005</LINK>, the participants having active treatment being significantly more likely to stop before completion of the course ( RR 5.18, 95%CI: 1.29, 20.83).</P>
<P>Adverse events following BCG instillation were assessed in two studies. Mayer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>) reported the occurrence of 'more than one adverse event' in 95% of participants whether they received BCG or placebo. More significant adverse events were seen in around 50% of both groups, while one participant withdrew from each arm of the trial because of a severe adverse event. Peters et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>) found no difference in the overall rate of adverse events with instillation of BCG or placebo, or during follow-up. Subjective bladder symptoms, including pain, were the same for the BCG and placebo groups in both studies. Haematuria was more common with BCG than placebo in both <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1997</LINK>(RR 1.78, 95%CI: 1.19, 2.66). Mayer et al reported less arthralgia/myalgia with BCG instillation than with placebo ( RR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.92) while Peters et al found no difference in arthralgia rates between the two groups during instillation or follow-up.</P>
<P>There was little mention made of adverse events in the trial of pentosanpolysulphate instillation (<LINK REF="STD-Bade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bade 1997</LINK>). Haematuria was described as 'rarely seen', there were no irritative symptoms reported and the single drop-out from the study was from the active treatment group and reportedly due to lack of treatment efficacy.</P>
<P>In the crossover study of DMSO vs placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK>) there were adverse events reported in five participants (15%). Three were minor, the report not stating which instillation was being given at the time, while two were severe and occurred in the placebo instillation phase.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. One intravesical treatment versus another</HEADING>
<P>Of the two trials comparing one intravesical treatment with another, the study by Peeker et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>) did not provide useful data for any outcome. The report did not specify the numbers of participants in either group during the initial instillation while treatment cross-over only occurred if the first one was ineffective. The only outcome used in the cross-over trial by Nguan et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nguan 2005</LINK>) was the mean pain-score change after each of two sequential instillations. The available data suggested that the mean(SD) change after an acidic instillation, 0.33(3.43), was similar to that which followed a neutral instillation, 0.50(2.78). Further analysis using Revman was not possible as the paper did not report within-subject differences in outcome for the two treatments.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Barbalias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barbalias 2000</LINK> the combination of bladder training and intravesical oxybutinin was followed by a larger increase in mean cystometric capacity than bladder training alone (102 ml vs 37.4 ml). This result was reported to be statistically significant but there was no measure of variance provided and so data could not be shown graphically in the review. See other data table 05.01.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Frequency</HEADING>
<P>Combining intravesical oxybutinin with bladder training was followed by a significant reduction in daily voiding frequency compared with bladder training alone but the lack of any information on variance precluded Revman entry. (See other data table 05.02.)</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:13:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence identified and reviewed was very limited and at best provided only 'pointers' for guiding clinical practice.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>As anticipated prior to undertaking this review, the number of studies suitable for inclusion was limited. While it was not expected that we would necessarily find high quality studies on all of the instillation treatments for PBS/IC, the lack of good evidence for some that are more commonly used was notable. It is apparent that most research has used NIDDK criteria for participant inclusion and as such the trial participants are likely to be a reasonably homogeneous group. Such adherence to the NIDDK diagnostic criteria may mean that the participants included in these studies differ in some ways from other patients who are diagnosed with PBS/IC in clinical practice. The trial interventions varied widely as did the methods of assessing treatment response. This being the case there was little scope for combining data from trials, even when two studies looked at the same intervention there were limited outcomes that were similar enough for the results to be combined for any meaningful meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The outcomes presented in the protocol for this review had been chosen to reflect either important benefit or a particular disadvantage that might arise from the treatments. As we have described in the results section and shown in the comparison tables, there was considerable variation among the studies in the assessment and reporting of outcomes and many of the prestated review outcomes were not reported. Given that pain is such a defining feature of the condition it was surprising that this was not universally reported. Long-term efficacy data is lacking for most of the treatments, as is data on the need for future treatment. The question of economic outcomes was not addressed in any of the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The nine trials that make up this review cover six different interventions for treating PBS/IC. While aspects of the methodology and reporting can be assessed the trials cannot all be directly compared for consistency of results. Indeed there are only two interventions where more than one study is available for analysis. The trials were all small. A calculation of sample size for power to detect a difference was described for five of the trials, although this sample size was not achieved in all cases and in others it did not apply to all of the outcomes being assessed.</P>
<P>The six parallel-design studies generally had satisfactory designs although the presentation of continuous data often lacked any measure of variance which precluded entry into Revman for analysis. Of the three remaining studies <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Marrero-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Marrero 1988</LINK> was of cross-over design and provided individual participant data that could be analysed with Revman, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Nguan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nguan 2005</LINK>, also a cross-over study, did not. The study by Peeker et al (<LINK REF="STD-Peeker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peeker 2000</LINK>) was not a true cross-over design in that only some of the participants from each arm crossed over to receive the alternative treatment. There was insufficient information provided to allow parallel analysis of the first period of the trial and consequently data from this study has not contributed to the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases and limitations in the review process</HEADING>
<P>A major concern was that selective reporting of our prestated outcome might have introduced bias. In the course of completing this review we therefore attempted to contact several authors for additional information or data, but with only very limited success.</P>
<P>Care has been taken when analysing the studies, particularly those with the same intervention such as the two resiniferatoxin and the two BCG studies, to avoid grouping outcomes together unless they were reported in the same terms. This may mean that we have kept data apart which may in fact have been very similar and when combined could have provided stronger evidence of effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Resiniferatoxin: </B>was tested in one small to medium-sized trial (Payne 2005) and one small-sized trial (Chen 2005). There was no evidence of sustained differences in the review outcomes reported (pain, bladder capacity, frequency, nocturia, symptomatic improvement, and quality of life), although data were sparse and some confidence intervals too wide to rule out clinically important differences. Pain during instillation was about 50% more commonly reported after Resiniferatoxin, and this was associated with about a five times increased likelihood of participants choosing to withdraw from a course of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): </B>was tested in a single cross-over trial including 33 participants (Perez-Marrero 1988), with few data on review outcomes reported. The limited data showed no apparent difference between the groups in pain and bladder capacity; the two reports of serious adverse events both followed placebo instillation.</P>
<P>
<B>BCG: </B>was tested in one relatively larger trial (Mayer 2005) and one small trial (Peters 1997). The results of both studies favoured the BCG group in respect of pain, although neither difference was statistically significant. No clear differences were observed in bladder capacity and frequency. Symptom scores also favoured the BCG groups, and the difference was statistically significant within a meta-analysis of the two studies; quality of life measures favoured the BCG group in the small trial (Peters 1997), but not the larger trial (Mayer 2005). Nearly all participants (95%) in the Mayer trial reported more than one adverse event with no difference between the groups in this respect - with only one withdrawal in each group. The Peters trial reported no differences in adverse events other than more haematuria in the BCG group. There was a suggestion that BCG might reduce arthralgia/myalgia.</P>
<P>
<B>Pentosanpolysulphate: </B>was testing in a single small trial. Bladder capacity was reported to be significantly higher after active treatment but the difference (33mls) is of uncertain clinical significance. The limited data on frequency and nocturia non-significantly favoured the active group with wide confidence intervals. There was little mention of adverse events in the trial's report.</P>
<P>
<B>Oxybutinin:</B> was tested in combination with bladder training versus placebo instillation plus bladder training in a single small trial (Barbalias 2000). No pain data were reported. The oxybutin group had significantly increased bladder capacity, and reduced frequency. While both groups' quality of life scores improved, the change was significantly larger in the oxybutinin group. Adverse events were not reported, but drop-outs were less common in the oxybutinin group (1/24 versus 4/12).</P>
<P>
<B>Alkalinisation of urine pH:</B> was compared in a single cross-over trial involving 26 women and this showed no clear differences, but with potentially wide confidence intervals.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Trial evidence to guide the clinical use of intravesical treatments for Painful bladder syndrome/Interstitial cystitis is very limited. Of the six types of instillation tested, the evidence is most promising for BCG and oxybutin and both appear to be reasonably well tolerated. Resiniferatoxin showed no evidence of benefit but caused pain which significantly reduced treatment compliance. There is little evidence to guide the use of other intravesical treatments. Adverse events were commonly reported after instillation irrespective of whether 'active' or placebo treatments, and this should be taken into account when making a recommendation about intravesical treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The review has shown the clear need for further randomised trials of instilled treatments for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis: evidence about current treatments is insufficient; some currently used agents have significant adverse effects; and instillation itself is associated with adverse events. Future trials could be of three types. The first is further trials of the two most promising treatments - BCG and oxybutinin - large enough to confirm or refute the benefits suggested in this review; the second is further trials of some of the other agents tested in trials considered in this review, such as DMSO and Pentosanpolysulphate, where current evidence is so limited; the third is trials of other promising agents, such as hyaluronic acid, for which there are currently no trials.</P>
<P>The choice of appropriate control management should warrant careful consideration. The frequency of reports of unwanted effects after placebo instillation indicates that placebo management should not be undertaken lightly and its choice must have a strong scientific underpinning. However, the principal questions at the moment, judged on the evidence reviewed here, relate to efficacy (whether the treatments can work in an ideal setting). It therefore does seem reasonable to include placebo groups in future trials given the likely placebo effects. Once efficacious intravesical agents have been identified it would then be appropriate to undertake trials with more pragmatic designs. These could be of alternative agents,or of alternative routes of administration (such as of oxybutinin), or of broader alternative forms of management for painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis.</P>
<P>Another important consideration in future trials should be the eligibility criteria. This review has dealt mainly with studies recruiting using NIDDK criteria. This will not always reflect current clinical practice, and consideration should be given to using wider diagnostic criteria based on more clinical grounds.</P>
<P>As painful bladder syndrome/Interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition, cross-over designs may be a statistically efficient way to evaluate short-term efficacy. However, a key issue is whether any beneficial effects are sustained over time, and assessing this would require a parallel group design. Indeed, longer-term outcomes including relapse of symptoms and need for further treatment would be important components of future evaluations.</P>
<P>Researchers should be encouraged to develop a standard set of validated outcome measures to allow later combination of data across trials in future systematic reviews; existing measures such as the ICSI and ICPI are candidates for this.</P>
<P>Finally, the trials considered in this review were not well reported. Use of standard approaches, such as described in the CONSORT statement, should be encouraged, with the data reported in a way that would allow later reanalysis with other trial data (e.g. mandatory reporting of measures of variance for all estimates of differences).</P>

<P>Cross-over trial with placebo.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>33 participants (30 women) with mean age of 48 and mean symptom-duration of 5 years.<BR/>Diagnosis made clinically and with cystoscopy/biopsy. <BR/>Stated to be in 'early stages of disease' without Hunner's ulcers or contracted bladders. <BR/>One woman excluded (from placebo group) soon after starting trial when becoming pregnant.<BR/>Two withdrew during the study (see details in 'outcomes' below).</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Four treatments, each 2 weeks apart, involving outpatient bladder instillations given via catheter and lasting at least 15 minutes.<BR/>Group 1 (15 pts). 50ml of 50% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<BR/>Group 2 (17 pts). 50ml of normal saline.<BR/>After a 4 week 'rest' period the two groups crossed over, to complete the instillations with the 'other' treatment<BR/>ie placebo for group 1 and DMSO for group 2.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Timing of assessment is unclear, but looks to have occurred soon after each phase of treatment has been given.<BR/> Assessment at the end of each phase of the study comprised:</P>
<P>1. Subjective assessment by subjects.<BR/> Response to treatment rated as either minimal, moderate or marked.<BR/> Group 1. Minimal response 13% ( after rest and cross-over to placebo the figures were: 13% min, 33% mod and 53% marked improvement)<BR/> Moderate response 47%<BR/> Marked response 40%</P>
<P> Group 2. Minimal response 41% (after rest and cross-over to DMSO the figures were 33% min, 20% mod and 47% marked improvement).<BR/> Moderate response 41%<BR/> Marked response 18%</P>
<P>2. Objective outcome; based on Urodynamics, 48 hour voiding chart, digital linear-type scale for symptoms of pain, urgency and frequency.<BR/> ('Valid' objective improvement required consistency between urodynamic results, diary data and symptom-scale results.)</P>
<P>After Phase One:</P>
<P> Group 1. Objective improvement in 93% (after rest and cross-over to placebo this group continued to show improvement in 86% of subjects) <BR/> Group 2. Objective improvement in 35% ( after rest and cross-over to DMSO this group showed improvement in 67% of subjects)</P>
<P>Improvement in pain:<BR/> - with DMSO (given as initial or second instillation) pain resolved in 23/28.<BR/> - with placebo (given as initial or second instillation) pain resolved in 22/28.<BR/> Analysed binary crossover pain data using Generic Inverse Variance method: Estimate = 0.2231 (SE = 0.6767)</P>
<P>Improvement in bladder capacity:<BR/>(Analysed as continuous crossover data using Generic Inverse Variance method): Mean (SE) of within-subject difference = 17.0 ml(14.4)</P>
<P>Adverse effects: </P>
<P>Two participants withdrew from the study at the end of phase one (both from group 2, ie after placebo).<BR/>Adverse effects seen in 5 subjects(15%) - 3 minor (2 UTI, 1 Biliary colic). Uncertain if placebo or DMSO.<BR/> - 2 severe (1 hemiparesis, 1 migraine both subsiding within 48 hrs). Both during placebo phase.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Good attempt at concealing treatment from subjects and clinic staff, difficult due to unique side effects of one preparation.<BR/>Independent outcome assessment by different staff.</P>

<P>Group 2 (15 pts).<BR/>50ml of sterile saline.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Follow-up was for a minimum of 6 months except for the one subject unblinded to withdraw because severe arthralgia during instillations.<BR/>'Responders' to treatment (ie at least moderate improvement in overall symptoms at exit questionnaire):<BR/>Group 1. 60%<BR/>Group 2. 27%</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Randomisation and blinding stated but not described.<BR/>Attempted to contact author regarding outcome data in terms of treatment group, rather than just responder/non-responder. Replied 11/06 'looking for data.' <BR/>The only data able to be put into comparisons table is that for pain and for 'response' to treatment.<BR/>Number in the BCG group was 17 to start with, left at 17 for adverse effect analysis, but for efficacy, reduced to 15 as only 15 evaluated at end.</P>
