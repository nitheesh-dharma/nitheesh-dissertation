<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-07 09:32:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease. People with phenylketonuria can either not process phenylalanine from their diet at all or only in part. High blood levels of phenylalanine can cause brain or nerve damage. A diet avoiding foods high in phenylalanine can be hard to follow. People with phenylketonuria can have low levels of the amino acid tyrosine in their blood. We searched for trials which compared adding tyrosine to diet along with or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet. We were able to include three trials with 56 people in the review. Although the amount of tyrosine measured in the blood of those taking the supplement was higher, there were no differences noted in any other outcome measures. There is no evidence to suggest that tyrosine should be routinely added to the diet of people with phenylketonuria. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to provide more evidence.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-07-18 16:11:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease for which the main treatment is the dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet has to be initiated in the neonatal period to prevent or reduce mental handicap. However, the diet is very restrictive and unpalatable and can be difficult to follow. A deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine has been suggested as a cause of some of the neuropsychological problems exhibited in phenylketonuria. Therefore, this review aims to assess the efficacy of tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of tyrosine supplementation alongside or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet for people with phenylketonuria, who commenced on diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life. To assess the evidence that tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet improves intelligence, neuropsychological performance, growth and nutritional status, mortality rate and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-18 16:11:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearches of the <I>Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease</I> (from inception in 1978 to 1998). The manufacturers of prescribable dietary products used in the treatment of phenylketonuria were also contacted for further references.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 28 June 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating the use of tyrosine supplementation versus placebo in people with phenylketonuria in addition to, or instead of, a phenylalanine-restricted diet. People treated for maternal phenylketonuria were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:11:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Six trials were found, of which three trials reporting the results of a total of 56 participants, were suitable for inclusion in the review. The blood tyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in the participants receiving tyrosine supplements than those in the placebo group, mean difference 23.46 (95% confidence interval 12.87 to 34.05). No significant differences were found between any of the other outcomes measured.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>From the available evidence no recommendations can be made about whether tyrosine supplementation should be introduced into routine clinical practice. Further randomised controlled studies are required to provide more evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-07 09:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-07-07 09:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disease which affects 100 cases per million live births in Caucasian and Oriental populations (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 1995</LINK>). This disease is characterised by an absence or deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a liver enzyme which is involved in the breakdown of the essential amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. In classical PKU there is a total, or almost total, deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to high blood phenylalanine concentrations of 1200 &#956;mol/L or more (<LINK REF="REF-Scriver-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scriver 1995</LINK>). In some cases blood phenylalanine concentrations are persistently raised above 400 &#956;mol/L, but not to the levels seen in classical PKU, although some degree of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity remains present. These conditions are called the hyperphenylalaninaemias. However, for the purpose of this review the term PKU will be used to include both classical PKU and the hyperphenylalaninaemias.</P>
<P>In an infant with PKU, the blood phenylalanine concentration is within the normal range at birth, but becomes elevated usually within several hours to a few days of commencing a normal dietary protein intake. In severe cases this leads to neurological damage and mental retardation if left untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Paine-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paine 1957</LINK>). In infants with less severe phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency the occurrence of brain damage is more variable.</P>
<P>The results of a number of cohort studies have indicated that dietary treatment of PKU is effective in preventing, or reducing, mental handicap, if initiated within the first 20 days of life (<LINK REF="REF-MRC1-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC1 1993</LINK>). The main principle of the diet is to reduce blood phenylalanine levels by avoiding foods with moderate to high levels of phenylalanine and to provide additional protein using a low phenylalanine or phenylalanine-free amino acid supplement (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 1994</LINK>). It is currently recommended that this diet is continued for life (<LINK REF="REF-MRC2-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC2 1993</LINK>). The diet for PKU can be very complicated to follow and is often considered to be unpalatable. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for people to adhere to the diet strictly, if at all. In view of this researchers have investigated other potential therapies which would facilitate compliance to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>). Supplementation of the diet with tyrosine is one such therapy which has been studied in PKU.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:13:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Tyrosine, a neutral amino acid, is a precursor of two central neurotransmitters (chemicals which assist in the transmission of nerve impulses), dopamine and noradrenaline. High blood concentrations of phenylalanine have been found to impair uptake of tyrosine into the brain and result in lower than normal levels of tyrosine in both the blood and the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Oldendorf-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldendorf 1973</LINK>). This deficiency of tyrosine has been suggested as one reason for the decreased neuropsychological performance seen in some people with PKU (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>). It has been suggested that tyrosine supplementation could have an important role in the treatment of PKU, although trials investigating this have achieved differing results and no specific recommendations have been made for its use (<LINK REF="REF-Lou-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lou 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzocco-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzocco 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to examine evidence that, in people with PKU (who commenced the diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life) tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of low phenylalanine diet, improves: intelligence; neuropsychological performance; growth and nutritional status; mortality rate; and quality of life.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:46:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials included in the review, according to the method described by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). If the two authors disagreed about the quality of a trial, then the disagreement was resolved by discussion until a consensus was reached.</P>
<P>The method used to assess the quality of the trials focuses on four areas: allocation concealment; generation of the randomisation sequence; intention-to-treat analysis and blinding. We graded whether the allocation of participants to treatment groups was concealed to the investigators as being adequate, unclear or inadequate. We used the same three categories to assess the adequacy of the method used to generate the randomisation sequence. The third area by which we assessed the quality of the trials was whether an intention-to-treat analysis was employed. We assessed this using the following categories; adequate, unclear or with exclusions (i.e. participants were excluded from the final analysis).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:30:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>For binary outcome measures, we planned to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies, (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls). For continuous outcomes, we planned to record either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment/intervention values and standard deviation or standard error for each group. We planned to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference. </P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-09-12 14:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We considered three methods of analysis for cross-over trials, depending on which data were available (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). The ideal approach would have been to use the results of paired analysis, as this would have allowed a within-individual comparison of the treatment effect. If such data were not available, a second approach would have been to use data from the first arm of the trial only, and to ignore data from after the participants crossed-over into the second arm of the trial. A third, and unsatisfactory, approach would have been to ignore the cross-over design and use the combined results. This approach disregards the fact that the participants have appeared in both arms of the trial. The concern with this approach is the risk that any carry-over effect of the treatment could distort the results of the individual trials, and ultimately the meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Three trials (56 participants) met the criteria for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzocco-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzocco 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>). All the trials investigated the effect of tyrosine supplementation in people with PKU who were diagnosed by neonatal screening and commenced on phenylalanine-restricted diet in early infancy. The trial by Pietz included people who had been on a relaxed diet for at least a year and investigated the effect of tyrosine supplementation alongside a relaxed diet (<LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>). In the trials by Smith and Mazzocco, tyrosine supplementation in addition to the phenylalanine-restricted diet was investigated in a group of people who had remained on the diet from diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzocco-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzocco 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>). All of the three trials were of cross-over design and both treatment and control arms of two of the trials were of four weeks duration (<LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>). The remaining trial entailed a double cross-over design with each arm lasting 10 to 14 days and no washout period in between (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzocco-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzocco 1992</LINK>).

One trial, which entailed a double cross-over design with each arm lasting 10 to 14 days and no washout period in between, published data which allowed the results of the first arm of the trial only to be used in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzocco-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzocco 1992</LINK>). Similar first-arm data were not provided in the remaining two trials (where both treatment and control arms were of four weeks duration), therefore this method of analysis was not an option. For these, data from both arms of the trial had been combined, thus ignoring the cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Pietz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pietz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>).</P>

One trial was identified which investigated the effect of tyrosine supplementation for PKU, however, we did not consider this eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Lou-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 1987</LINK>). The reason for this was that the intervention was only administered for three days, and most of the participants (9 of 14) did not achieve dietary control within the recommended time frame (before one month of age). In addition, this trial employed a cross-over design, but the trial publication does not provide the necessary data to allow the appropriate analysis of the results. A third trial investigated intellectually disabled adults with untreated PKU <LINK REF="STD-Kalkanoglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalkanoglu 2005</LINK>. The final trial investigated the use of phenylalanine-free protein substitutes, containing all amino acids other than phenylalanine, rather than just the effect of an additional tyrosine only supplement (<LINK REF="STD-MacDonald-2003" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald 2003</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The three trials considered in this review were of a good quality, but only included a small number of participants. The length of the treatment and control arms were short in all three trials and some of the outcomes considered important in this review were not measured. A significant difference was found between the blood tyrosine concentration in the treatment and control arm of all three trials, as would be expected when the treatment was tyrosine supplementation. No other significant differences were found in any of the other outcomes. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-11 15:13:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions can be reached on the effectiveness of tyrosine supplementation in PKU based on the evidence currently available. It is suggested that tyrosine supplementation is not introduced into widespread clinical practice until this intervention has been evaluated in a large multicentre RCT.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-11 15:13:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are good theoretical reasons for believing that tyrosine supplementation may improve neuropsychological performance in PKU. There is thus a need for this intervention to be properly evaluated in RCTs over a long enough time period for any therapeutic effect to be demonstrated. Attention needs to be paid to including adequate numbers of participants, the dosage of tyrosine to be used and the length of time over which the intervention is taken. It would also be necessary to consider which are the appropriate outcomes to measure and consumer involvement in the design of the trial would be useful.</P>
