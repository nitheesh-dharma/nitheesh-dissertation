<P>This review assessed the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects that single dose oral dextropropoxyphene taken alone or in combination with paracetamol had in treating moderate to severe postoperative pain. The combination of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg with paracetamol 650 mg showed similar efficacy to that of tramadol 100 mg for single dose studies in postoperative pain but with a lower incidence of side effects. This review also highlighted that Ibuprofen 400 mg was yet more effective than both tramadol 100 mg and dextropropoxyphene 65 mg.<BR/>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:56:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 1999. Patient surveys have shown that postoperative pain is often not managed well, and there is a need to assess the efficacy and safety of commonly used analgesics as newer treatments become available. Dextropropoxyphene is one example of an opioid analgesic that used to be widely prescribed for pain relief in combination with paracetamol under names such as Co-proxamol and Distalgesic. This drug is now only available on a named patient basis in the UK. For this group there is a provision for the supply of unlicensed co-proxamol on the responsibility of the prescriber.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single dose oral dextropropoxyphene alone and in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) for moderate to severe postoperative pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Published studies were identified from: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL up to December 2007, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database (1954 to 1994).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The inclusion criteria used were: full journal publication, postoperative pain, postoperative oral administration, adult participants, baseline pain of moderate to severe intensity, double-blind design, and random allocation to treatment groups which included dextropropoxyphene and placebo or a combination of dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol and placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors, and studies were quality scored.</P>
<P>Summed pain intensity and pain relief data were extracted and converted into dichotomous information to yield the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief. This was used to calculate the relative benefit and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) for one participant to achieve at least 50% pain relief.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:56:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies (440 participants) compared dextropropoxyphene with placebo, four studies (325 participants) and one individual patient meta-analysis (638 participant) compared dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol 650 mg with placebo.</P>
<P>For a single dose of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg in postoperative pain the NNT for at least 50% pain relief was 7.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6 to 22) when compared with placebo over four to six hours. There was no significant difference between the proportion of participants remedicating within four to eight hours with dextroporpoxyphene 65 mg (35%) and placebo (43%), relative risk 0.8 (0.7 to 1.03).</P>
<P>For the equivalent dose of dextropropoxyphene combined with paracetamol 650 mg the NNT was 4.4 (3.5 to 5.6) when compared with placebo. These results were compared with those for other analgesics obtained from equivalent systematic reviews. Significantly fewer participants remedicated within four to eight hours with dextropropoxyphene 65 mg combined with paracetamol 650 mg (34%) than with placebo (57%), relative risk 0.7 (0.5 to 0.8).</P>
<P>Pooled data showed increased incidence of central nervous system adverse effects for dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol compared with placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:56:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Since the last version of this review no new relevant studies have been identified. The combination of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg with paracetamol 650 mg shows similar efficacy to tramadol 100 mg for single dose studies in postoperative pain but with a lower incidence of adverse effects. The same dose of paracetamol combined with 60 mg codeine appears more effective but, with the slight overlap in the 95% CI, this conclusion is not robust. Adverse effects of both combinations were similar.</P>
<P>Ibuprofen 400 mg has a lower (better) NNT than both dextropropoxyphene 65 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg and tramadol 100 mg.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:56:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 1999) on 'Single dose dextropropoxyphene for the treatment of acute postoperative pain'.</P>
<P>Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic which has been widely available since the 1950s. It used to be commonly available, particularly in combination with paracetamol under such names as Co-proxamol and Distalgesic. In 1996, there were ten million prescriptions in England for Co-proxamol alone, representing one fifth of all analgesics prescribed (opioid, non-opioid centrally acting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)) though it is not clear how much was used for postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-GSS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">GSS 1996</LINK>). There have been increasing limits on prescribing in recent years, especially in the UK, and to some extent in Australia. The reason for this was concern about intentional overdose in the community, and as many as 300 to 400 deaths per year were attributed to dextropropoxyphene combinations with paracetamol. The result is that the combination of dextropropoxyphene combined with paracetamol is much less prescribed in the UK with 2006 prescriptions down to 1.4 million of dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol. This drug is now only available on a named patient basis in the UK. For this group there is a provision for the supply of unlicensed co-proxamol on the responsibility of the prescriber.</P>
<P>Patient surveys have shown that postoperative pain is often not managed well (<LINK REF="REF-Bruster-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruster 1994</LINK>). There is no report of significant improvement in acute pain treatment in hospital in recent decades with the use of dextropropoxyphene, although individual units can often demonstrate excellent results. In part this is because of managerial problems rather than a lack of analgesic efficacy. The efficacy and safety of commonly used analgesics and newer treatments still require evaluation. Judging relative analgesic efficacy is difficult as clinical trials use a variety of comparators; more recent clinical trials tend to be better conducted and reported, and are larger than older ones. Efficacy can be determined indirectly by comparing analgesics with placebo in similar clinical circumstances to produce a common analgesic descriptor such as number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) to achieve at least 50% pain relief.</P>
<P>A reliable method has been developed to convert mean pain outcome values from categorical scales (percent of maximum possible pain intensity or pain relief; %maxSPID and %maxTOTPAR) into dichotomous information (number of participants with at least 50% pain relief) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). Other possible outcomes of interest include the requirement of patients to remedicate within a particular time window.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantitatively evaluate the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of dextropropoxyphene, both with and without paracetamol, in postoperative pain. To compare the results with those for other analgesics assessed in the same way in order to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies were included if they were a full journal publication of single dose, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in postoperative pain. Multiple dose studies were included if the appropriate data from the first dose was available.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded if they did not clearly state that the interventions had been randomly allocated. Also excluded were studies of experimental pain, case reports and clinical observations. Abstracts and unpublished data were not included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Only studies of adult participants with established postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity were included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies were included if they contained a treatment group allocated to either dextropropoxyphene alone or a combination of dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol. Treatments and placebo were administered orally.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The derived pain relief outcomes used were TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) over four to six hours or sufficient data provided to allow their calculation. The pain measures used for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were the five point pain relief (PR) scale with standard or comparable wording (none, slight, moderate, good, complete) or the four point pain intensity (PI) scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) or a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain relief or pain intensity.</P>
<P>Also accepted were global evaluations of pain relief over four to six hours if measured on a five point scale by the participant and not the investigator. The data were extracted as dichotomous information (number of participants reporting good or excellent).</P>
<P>The number of participants who remedicated in the period of four to eight hours was also used, and the median time to remedication, if information was available was also assessed.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:57:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>From each study we extracted: the number of participants treated, the mean TOTPAR or mean SPID, study duration, the dose of dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol where appropriate, and information on adverse effects. Mean TOTPAR and mean SPID values were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The following equations were used to estimate the proportion of participants achieving at least 50% maxTOTPAR (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>):</P>
<P>Proportion with &gt;50% maxTOTPAR = 1.33 x mean %maxTOTPAR - 11.5</P>
<P>Proportion with &gt;50% maxTOTPAR = 1.36 x mean %maxSPID - 2.3</P>
<P>The proportions were converted to the number of participants achieving at least 50% maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. The number of participants with at least 50% maxTOTPAR was then used to calculate relative benefit and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT).</P>
<P>Relative benefit (RB) and relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1986</LINK>). Homogeneity was assumed when P &gt; 0.1. A statistically significant benefit of active treatment over placebo was assumed when the lower limit of the 95% CI of the RB was &gt;1. A statistically significant benefit of placebo over active treatment was assumed when the upper limit of the 95% CI of the RB was &lt;1. NNT and number-needed-to-treat-to-harm (NNH) with 95% CI were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). The CI includes no benefit of one treatment over the other when the upper limit is represented as infinity. Calculations were performed using Excel v 5.0 on a Macintosh Performa 6320.</P>
<P>Dextropropoxyphene is available as either a hydrochloride or napsylate salt. Equivalent molar doses are 65 mg of dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride and 100 mg of dextropropoxyphene napsylate. We did not distinguish between the different salts, other than to combine equivalent doses of dextropropoxyphene base.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:57:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>One hundred and thirty two published studies were identified from the search as potential single dose RCTs. Two could not be obtained through either Oxford University Library or the British Library and attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful. Five citations obtained from reference lists of the retrieved studies could not be traced by the British Library. Of the 125 retrieved studies 34 were not RCTs, 21 were not postoperative pain models or included other pain conditions, 27 were not placebo controlled, in five dextropropoxyphene was administered but was not the intervention being investigated, one was a preliminary report of a trial in progress which contained no data, one was an abstract and one was intra-muscular administration.</P>
<P>Of the 35 RCTs that were placebo controlled 23 were excluded. In 16 studies participants did not have baseline pain of at least moderate severity. This is methodologically important as testing the intervention on participants with established pain ensures adequate sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Lasagna-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasagna 1962</LINK>). In six studies pain outcome measurements other than those described in the selection criteria were used. As the method for generating dichotomous data has only been verified for the most commonly used pain scales (those described in the selection criteria) applied over four to six hours, other outcome measurements cannot be legitimately used with this technique. One study was not double-blind. The data from one study was duplicated and therefore added to the primary study which was <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>. Eleven reports met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Each report was independently scored for quality by two of the review authors using a three-item scale with a maximum score of five (see below) (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996b</LINK>); all of the review authors then met to agree upon a 'consensus' score for each report.</P>
<P>The quality scores for individual studies are reported in the notes section of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. These scores were not used to weight the results in any way.</P>
<P>The scale used is as follows:<BR/>Is the study randomised ? If yes - 1 point<BR/>Is the randomisation procedure reported and is it appropriate ? If yes add 1 point, if no deduct 1 point<BR/>Is the study double blind ? If yes add 1 point<BR/>Is the double blind method reported and is it appropriate ? If yes add 1 point, if no deduct 1 point<BR/>Are the reasons for patient withdrawals and dropouts described ? If yes add 1 point</P>

<B>Dextropropoxyphene versus placebo</B>
<BR/>Six studies compared dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride 65 mg (214 participants) with placebo (226 participants), and one study also compared a dose of 130 mg (25 participants) with placebo (25 participants). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloomfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomfield 1980</LINK>) investigated postpartum pain (episiotomy), one pain following peridontal surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1986</LINK>), one post-urogenital surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 1976</LINK>), one post-gynaecological surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Staden-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Van Staden 1971</LINK>), and one after various surgical interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Trop-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Trop 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>The placebo response rate (the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief with placebo) varied between 4 and 76%. The dextropropoxyphene response rate (the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief with dextropropoxyphene) varied between 19 and 84%. Dextropropoxyphene 65 mg was significantly different from placebo, RB 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9).</P>
<P>For a single dose of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg the NNT was 7.7 (4.6 to 22) for at least 50% pain relief over a period of four to six hours compared with placebo for pain of moderate to severe intensity. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Trop-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Trop 1979</LINK>) used a dose of 130 mg of dextropropoxyphene (25 participants). The RB estimate for dextropropoxyphene 130 mg compared with placebo was 10 (1.4 to 72) and the NNT was 2.8 (1.8 to 6.5) for at least 50% relief of pain of moderate to severe intensity over a period of five hours compared with placebo.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the proportion of participants remedicating within four to eight hours with dextroporpoxyphene 65 mg (35%) and placebo (43%), RR 0.8 (0.7 to 1.03).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Adverse effects:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Details of adverse effects are given in the notes section of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. No participants withdrew as a result of adverse effects. All were reported as transient and of mild to moderate severity. One study reported no adverse effects with either placebo or active treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study the authors reported both dextropropoxyphene 65 mg and 130 mg to have a significantly higher incidence of 'grogginess', 'sleepiness', and 'light-headedness' than placebo (P = 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Trop-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Trop 1979</LINK>). However, pooled data from the four studies reporting either drowsiness, sleepiness or somnolence (<LINK REF="STD-Bloomfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomfield 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trop-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Trop 1979</LINK>) showed no significant difference in incidence between dextropropoxyphene 65 mg (18/115) and placebo (15/121), with a RR of 1.3 (0.7 to 2.2). No other study reported light-headedness or 'grogginess' in the dextropropoxyphene group.</P>
<P>
<B>Dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol versus placebo</B>
<BR/>Four studies compared dextropropoxyphene napsylate 100 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg with placebo, and one used dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride 65 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg. A total of 478 participants received dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol, and 485 participants received placebo. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1981</LINK>) looked at pain following dental surgery (impacted third molar), two (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Honig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Honig 1981</LINK>) post-orthopaedic surgery, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>) pain following both dental and general surgery (abdominal, orthopaedic and gynaecological).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>) was a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 18 original studies providing dichotomous information (the number of participants achieving at least 50% maxTOTPAR). Eight of these studies investigated dextropropoxyphene napsylate 100 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg; one of these eight studies had been published separately by Sunshine et al and was added as a secondary study to <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>The placebo response rate varied between 6% and 27%. The dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol response rate varied between 25% and 57%. Dextropropoxyphene (65 mg hydrochloride or 100 mg napsylate) plus paracetamol 650 mg was significantly superior to placebo, relative benefit 2.5 (2.0 to 3.2). For a single dose of dextropropoxyphene (65 mg hydrochloride or 100 mg napsylate) plus paracetamol 650 mg the NNT was 4.4 (3.5 to 5.6) for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo for pain of moderate to severe intensity.</P>
<P>Significantly fewer participants remedicated within four to eight hours with dextropropoxyphene 65 mg combined with paracetamol 650 mg (34%) than with placebo (57%), RR 0.7 (0.5 to 0.8).</P>

<B>
<I>Adverse effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>Details of adverse effects are given in the notes section of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. No participants withdrew as a result of adverse effects and all were reported as transient and of mild to moderate severity. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Honig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Honig 1981</LINK>) did not give details of adverse effects but reported that there was no significant difference between active and placebo groups. The individual patient meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>) pooled data on adverse effects from all 18 placebo groups; 714 participants received placebo. Where possible the NNH has been calculated. This is the number of participants who need to receive the treatment in order for one of them to suffer the adverse event.</P>
<P>Three studies reported the incidence of drowsiness or somnolence (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). The pooled data indicated a significantly higher incidence of drowsiness and somnolence in the dextropropoxyphene combination group (57/405) than in the placebo group (55/799), with a RR of 2.1 (1.5 to 2.9) and a NNH of 14 (9.1 to 30).</P>
<P>Four studies reported dizziness (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). Pooled data indicated a significantly higher incidence of dizziness with dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (17/428) compared with placebo (16/829), with a RR of 2.2 (1.1 to 4.3) and NNH of 50 (24 to infinity).</P>
<P>Four studies reported the incidence of headache (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Honig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Honig 1981</LINK>). The pooled data showed dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (14/435) to have a significantly lower incidence of headache than placebo (51/829), with a RR of 0.5 (0.3 to 0.9) and number-needed-to-harm of -33 (-170 to -19).</P>
<P>Three studies reported the incidence of nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). Pooled data showed no significant difference with dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (12/405) than with placebo (33/799), RR 0.7 (0.4 to 1.4).</P>
<P>Vomiting was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). The incidence of vomiting with dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (2/323) was not significantly different from placebo (6/714), RR 1.4 (0.3 to 6.7).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-05 16:58:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>For a single dose of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg the NNT was 7.7 (4.6 to 22) for at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo. This means that one in every eight participants with pain of moderate to severe intensity would experience at least 50% pain relief with dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride 65 mg who would not have done so with placebo. The equivalent NNT for a single dose of dextropropoxyphene (65 mg hydrochloride or 100 mg napsylate) plus paracetamol 650 mg was 4.4 (3.5 to 5.6), indicating higher efficacy. The CIs of the NNT for dextropropoxyphene alone and for the combination with paracetamol overlapped.</P>
<P>For a single dose of dextropropoxyphene 130 mg the NNT was 2.8 (1.8 to 6.5). This difference in NNTs appears to show a dose response for dextropropoxyphene. However, given the overlapping CIs and the very small number of participants in the dextropropoxyphene 130 mg trial (50) this conclusion is not robust.</P>
<P>It was surprising that there were so few eligible randomised studies comparing either dextropropoxyphene alone or in combination with paracetamol against placebo considering the background of ten million prescriptions in 1996 in the UK for combinations with paracetamol. This probably reflects the fact that many of the studies were performed over 20 years ago when the now well established and validated methodology for single dose analgesic trials was still being developed.</P>
<P>A rank order of single dose analgesic efficacy in postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity was presented previously (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1998a</LINK>). The additional information came from systematic reviews of single dose studies of a wide range of analgesics tested in postoperative pain which used a similar method (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997c</LINK>). The only analgesic whose 95% CIs does not overlap the lower limit CI for the dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol combination was ibuprofen 400 mg (CI 2.5 to 3.0), which has a lower (better) NNT of 2.7. However, as some patients cannot be prescribed NSAIDS it may be more appropriate to compare dextropropoxyphene with tramadol or a combination of paracetamol and codeine. The dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (65 mg/650 mg) combination has a slightly lower NNT than that for tramadol 100 mg (NNT 4.8 (3.8 to 6.1)), although the CIs overlap substantially. Paracetamol 650 mg with codeine 60 mg has a lower NNT than both (NNT 3.6 (2.9 to 4.5)) with less overlap of the CIs.</P>
<P>With dextropropoxyphene with and without paracetamol, about 35% of participants remedicated within four to eight hours. With placebo, the percentage remedicating was higher at 43% and 57% respectively. For the latter, but not the former, the difference achieved statistical significance. It is possible that, with more comparative information for other analgesics, and especially with reporting at the level of the individual patient, more and better outcomes can be found, one of which is likely to be remedication time or percentage (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A single dose of dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol (65 mg/650 mg) showed a significantly higher incidence of central nervous system adverse effects (somnolence, dizziness) than placebo. The same dose of paracetamol when combined with codeine 60 mg also showed a significantly higher incidence of dizziness and drowsiness than placebo, NNH of 25 (7.7 to 257) and 10 (4.6 to 31) respectively. These adverse effects have also been shown for tramadol 100 mg with a lower (worse) NNH for both dizziness (NNH 13 (9 to 20)) and somnolence (NNH 9 (6 to 13)) (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). Tramadol 100 mg also showed a significantly higher incidence of nausea and vomiting than placebo. Nausea and vomiting were reported with both paracetamol combinations (dextropropoxyphene 65 mg or codeine 60 mg) but the incidence for either combination was not significantly different from placebo.</P>
<P>The combination of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg with paracetamol 650 mg showed similar efficacy to tramadol 100 mg for single dose studies in postoperative pain but the combination had a lower incidence of adverse effects. The same dose of paracetamol in combination with 60 mg codeine appears more effective, but with the slight overlap in the 95% CIs this conclusion is not robust. The two paracetamol combinations could not be separated for adverse effects as the NNH CIs for both dizziness and drowsiness/somnolence overlap considerably.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Dextropropoxyphene is not particularly effective on its own in single dose postoperative use. It is far more commonly used in combination with paracetamol and our results support the assertion that this provides more effective analgesia. However, evidence produced by the same methodology suggests that ibuprofen 400 mg provides better analgesia for postoperative pain than the paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene combination. In some parts of the world limitations on prescribing make dextropropoxyphene increasingly difficult to obtain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Dextropropoxyphene alone and in combination with paracetamol was previously extensively used. One of the major problems with reviewing such well established interventions is that the original studies may predate the development of validated analgesic trial methodology. However, a quantitative assessment of these interventions is required as a comparison for novel analgesics. Potentially more evidence may be produced by using the combination as the 'gold standard' analgesic in RCTs of new interventions. It is unlikely that new studies in acute pain will feature dextropropoxyphene alone or in combination with paracetamol, and there does not appear to be any pressing need for new studies because there are many alternative analgesics now available.</P>
<P>The combination of dextropropoxyphene with paracetamol has been widely used in chronic pain. Although results from single dose studies usually translate reasonably well to multiple dose situations, a method needs to be developed to quantitatively assess both efficacy and adverse effects in prolonged usage.</P>
