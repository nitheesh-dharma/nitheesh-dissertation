<P>In high- and moderate-income countries, labour wards have become the settings for childbirth for the majority of childbearing women. Routine medical interventions have also increased steadily over time, leading to many questions about benefits, safety, and risk for healthy childbearing women. The design of conventional hospital labour rooms is similar to the design of other hospital sick rooms, i.e. the hospital bed is a central feature of the room, and medical equipment is in plain view. In an effort to support normal labour and birth for healthy childbearing women, a variety of institutional maternity care settings have been constructed. Some are 'home-like' bedrooms within hospital labour wards. Others are 'home-like' birthing units adjacent to the labour wards. Others are freestanding birth centres. More recently, 'ambient' and Snoezelen rooms have been constructed within labour wards; these rooms are not home-like but contain a variety of sensory stimuli and furnishings designed to promote feelings of calmness, control, and freedom of movement.</P>
<P>The primary aim of this review is to evaluate the effects, on labour and birth outcomes, of care in an alternative institutional birth setting compared with care in a conventional hospital labour ward. We included ten trials involving 11,795 women. We found no trials of freestanding birth centres. When compared to conventional institutional settings, alternative settings were associated with reduced likelihood of medical interventions, increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, increased maternal satisfaction, and greater likelihood of continued breastfeeding at one to two months postpartum, with no apparent risks to mother or baby. Unfortunately, in several trials, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by differences in the organizational models of care (including separate staff and more continuity of caregiver in the alternative setting), and thus it is not possible to draw conclusions about the independent effects of the design of the birth environment. We conclude that women and policy makers should be informed about the benefits of institutional settings which focus on supporting normal labour and birth.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-26 15:40:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Ten trials involving 11,795 women met the inclusion criteria. We found no trials of freestanding birth centres or Snoezelen rooms. Allocation to an alternative setting increased the likelihood of: no intrapartum analgesia/anesthesia (six trials, n = 8953; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33); spontaneous vaginal birth (eight trials; n = 11,202; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05); breastfeeding at six to eight weeks (one trial, n = 1147; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06); and very positive views of care (two trials, n = 1207; RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.15). Allocation to an alternative setting decreased the likelihood of epidural analgesia (eight trials, n = 10.931; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87); oxytocin augmentation of labour (eight trials, n = 11,131; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88); instrumental vaginal birth (eight trials, n = 11,202; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99), and episiotomy (eight trials, n = 11,055; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90). There was no apparent effect on other adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. Care by the same or separate staff had no apparent effects. No conclusions could be drawn regarding the effects of continuity of caregiver or architectural characteristics. In several of the trials included in this review, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by important differences in the organizational models for care (separate staff for the alternative setting, offering more continuity of caregiver), and thus it is difficult to draw inferences about the independent effects of the physical birth environment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-22 10:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>In high- and moderate-income countries, labour wards have become the settings for labour and birth for the majority of childbearing women. Routine medical interventions have also increased steadily over time, leading to many questions about benefits, safety, and risk for healthy childbearing women. The design of conventional hospital labour rooms is similar to the design of other hospital patient rooms, i.e. the hospital bed is a central feature of the room, and medical equipment such as oxygen, suction, and intravenous equipment are in plain view.</P>
<P>As a critique of 'technological' approaches to childbirth, there has been a steady increase in interest in the impact of the care environment on the outcomes of labour and birth. Since the 1970s in many high-income countries, many hospitals have endeavoured to make their labour rooms or birthing units 'home-like,' although a more accurate term would be 'bedroom-like,' since the hospital bed is still the prominent feature. Labour rooms are decorated and furnished to be like Western middle-class bedrooms, with medical equipment concealed from view (<LINK REF="REF-Fannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fannin 2003</LINK>). The bedroom-like rooms draw on notions of domesticity and the naturalness of birth, while hiding the technology behind curtains and wood cabinets (<LINK REF="REF-Fannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fannin 2003</LINK>). According to Fannin (<LINK REF="REF-Fannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fannin 2003</LINK>), these hybrid spaces send dual messages to birthing women and to the staff working in them, exemplifying the struggles over competing conceptualizations of safety, control, and family, and thus over the very meaning of birth itself (<LINK REF="REF-Fannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fannin 2003</LINK>). In a parallel trend, alternative locations for care which are geographically separate from the hospital labour and delivery unit have been gaining prominence in high-income countries. These 'freestanding' birth centres have evolved both out of concerns that routine hospital policies and practices may have spillover effects on birth centre care, and as a means of providing an alternative to home birth. Freestanding units offer more scope for separation between 'technological' and 'social' models of birth, and recent observational evidence from The Birthplace study in England supports their efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years, in recognition that a bedroom (home-like or otherwise) may not be the optimum environment to support normal labour, other types of institutional birth settings have been constructed. While the new types of rooms share the same values (decreasing anxiety and fear, promoting mobility and personal control), they do not resemble home environments and do not contain hospital labour beds. One such room is the ambient room (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>), in which scenes from nature are projected on a wall, a variety of music is available, and other features encourage mobility during labour. Another type of room is the Snoezelen room, in which the user is exposed to multiple sensory stimulations including fibre-optic lights, auditory stimuli, and aromatherapy. A qualitative study of women's labour experiences in a Snoezelen room found that the users would choose it again in a future labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hauck-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauck 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternative settings vary in location and staffing models. While some alternative settings have arisen as a re-configuration of previously existing facilities, others have been purpose built. Some in-hospital birth centres are adjacent to conventional labour wards, or on another floor of the same hospital. Others are freestanding centres that are not physically part of a hospital but may or may not have administrative linkages to a hospital. The organizational models of care delivery in birth centres vary. The model of care may or may not involve continuity of care provider, in which the same staff provide antenatal as well as intrapartum care. While the core staff of birth centres are usually midwives or nurse-midwives, they may be a separate staff or they may be part of the regular labour ward staff. If they are part of the regular labour ward staff, they provide care for women in the birthing centre as well as women in the traditional labour ward, necessitating a shift in philosophical orientation from one emphasizing normality and avoidance of interventions to one emphasizing detection/management of risk and use of routine interventions. Another common, though not universal, feature is that these units have no routine input by medical practitioners. In these cases, the core staff are usually midwives or nurse-midwives, sometimes with the addition of trained but non-professional assistants, and/or doulas.</P>
<P>The focus of this review is on alternative institutional environments for labour and birth. While the home-like, ambient, and Snoezelen settings vary in whether they also include antenatal care, continuity of care, and in their structural characteristics, they share a philosophical orientation towards promoting normal birth. Their philosophies and guidelines value minimal intervention in labour and the promotion of enhanced freedom and control for women in labour, and booking is restricted to women deemed at low risk of obstetric emergency. All include labour rooms which do not look like hospital sick rooms. This review is complementary to two other Cochrane reviews, 'Midwifery-led versus other models of care delivery for childbearing women' (<LINK REF="REF-Hatem-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatem 2008</LINK>) and 'Home versus hospital birth' (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>The primary objective was to evaluate the effects, on labour and birth outcomes, of care in an alternative institutional birth setting compared with care in a conventional hospital labour ward.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to determine if the effects of care in alternative birth settings were influenced by:<BR/>(a) whether the staff in the alternative setting were also part of the conventional maternity care staff;<BR/>(b) whether care in the alternative setting included more continuity of care provider than women experienced in the conventional hospital setting;<BR/>(c) whether the alternative setting was in a building that was geographically separate from the hospital; and<BR/>(d) the architectural characteristics of the alternative setting.</P>

<P>We included trials if the intervention included care during labour and birth in an alternative institutional birth setting.

We excluded trials comparing home birth with institutional birth; they are the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2004</LINK>).</P>

In the prior update, one author (DW) assessed the risk of bias for <LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>. We would have resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Since women and care providers cannot be blinded to type of institutional birth environment, we considered blinding adequate if outcomes were recorded by outcome assessors who had no knowledge of the woman's group assignment. We judged studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. To be included in the review, data on a given outcome had to be available for at least 80% of those who were originally randomized. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we included missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:</P>

<LI>adequate;</LI>
<LI>inadequate:</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias, including, for example, whether the trial was stopped early due to a data-dependent process, there was evidence of extreme baseline imbalance, or there have been claims of fraud.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomized trials in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials. For cluster-randomized trials, we would have adjusted their sample sizes or standard errors<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If we had used ICCs from other sources, we would have reported this and conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we had identified both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we planned to synthesize the relevant information. We would have considered it reasonable to combine the results from both if there were little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit was considered to be unlikely. We would also have acknowledged heterogeneity in the randomization unit and performed a separate meta-analysis.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis for combining data.

<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity in a fixed-effect meta-analysis according to our pre-specified criteria, we repeated the analysis using a random-effects method.

<LI>type of alternative institutional setting (bedroom-like, ambient, Snoezelen); </LI>
<LI>location of alternative setting (in-hospital or freestanding birth centre);</LI>
<LI>staffing model (separate staff for alternative setting or same staff who work in conventional labour ward setting);</LI>

<P>The outcomes which we used in subgroup analyses were chosen from the primary outcomes, on the basis of their importance from the perspective of parents, care providers, and policy makers.

<P>For fixed-effect meta-analyses, we conducted planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.

<P>
<I>See</I> table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Ten trials involving 11,795 women met inclusion criteria for the review, although nine trials involving 11,503 women provided data for this review. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Abdullahi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullahi 1990</LINK>) (n = 292) reported no data relevant to the review's pre-specified outcomes. If in the future the trial authors supply usable data, we will incorporate the data into the review. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>) was a small randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of an ambient labour room. We found no trials of freestanding units, Snoezelen rooms or other alternative labour room designs. All other trials compared bedroom-like settings with conventional institutional labour wards. Five trials included at least some antenatal care in the alternative setting (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Byrne-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>All of the alternative settings were characterized by a philosophical orientation towards labour and birth as fundamentally normal experiences. All restricted access to women who were experiencing normal pregnancies. However, there were differences in the scope of the interventions. The Stockholm trial (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>) enrolled 1860 women in an evaluation of care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period by a team of 10 midwives at a hospital birth centre, compared with standard care by different midwives during the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal periods, in which intrapartum care was in a conventional labour ward in the same hospital. The Aberdeen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>) enrolled 2844 women in an evaluation of care in an alternative, midwife-managed delivery unit compared with care in a consultant-led labour ward; the same midwives also worked in both intrapartum settings. In the Norwegian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bernitz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bernitz 2011</LINK>), which enrolled 1111 in spontaneous labour, separate staff worked in the alternative and conventional settings. The London (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 1986</LINK>), Montreal (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>), Danish (<LINK REF="STD-Abdullahi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullahi 1990</LINK>) and Toronto (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>) trials were smaller trials which compared care in alternative birth rooms within standard labour wards; the same staff cared for women in both groups. The Leicester trial (<LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>) enrolled 3510 women in an evaluation of intrapartum care in an alternative, midwife-managed unit compared with care in a standard labour ward in the same hospital; women allocated to the former group had up to three antenatal visits in a clinic run by the midwives in the birth centre, with the remainder of their antenatal care by their general practitioner or community midwife. The Australian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Byrne-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 2000</LINK>) enrolled 201 women at 20 to 36 weeks' gestation. Birth centre care was provided by midwives who were 'committed to the normality of the birth process' and involved antenatal, intrapartum, and up to 12 hours of postnatal care. The Irish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2009</LINK>) enrolled 1653 women prior to 24 weeks' gestation, in an evaluation of midwifery-led versus consultant-led care. One component of midwifery-led care was the setting for intrapartum and postpartum care - a home-like unit adjacent to the conventional labour ward.</P>
<P>Thus the trials varied considerably in the scope of the intervention (study groups which differed solely in intrapartum care versus study groups in which there were differences in antenatal and/or postnatal care as well as intrapartum care), and the length of time between randomization and onset of 'treatment', but all trials shared common aspects of the intervention: intrapartum care in a setting that did not look like a conventional hospital patient room and did not offer medical interventions such as epidural analgesia or intrapartum oxytocics. All trials but one (<LINK REF="STD-Bernitz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bernitz 2011</LINK>), in which care in the alternative birth setting was by separate midwifery staff also involved increased continuity of caregiver.</P>
<P>We found no randomized trials which compared care in a freestanding birth centre with hospital-based birth centres or conventional hospital care.</P>
<P>Response rates to questionnaires seeking information about women's satisfaction with their birth experiences were at least 80% in only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>). Although 1860 women were enrolled in the Stockholm trial (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>), data on maternal satisfaction outcomes were sought from, and reported on, the first 1230 women who were enrolled. Postpartum questionnaire data were only available for 22% of those enrolled in the Irish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2009</LINK>). Of the three trials with usable outcome data, two (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>), employed the same measure of satisfaction (interest in the same birth setting in the future), while the third (<LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>) reported on whether the woman's labour and delivery were managed as she liked.</P>
<P>Substantial numbers of women allocated to alternative settings were transferred to standard care either before or during labour, because they no longer met eligibility criteria for the alternative setting. The most common reasons for intrapartum transfer were: failure to progress in labour, fetal distress, and desire for pharmacologic analgesia. In the Australian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Byrne-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 2000</LINK>), only 23/100 women allocated to birth centre care actually gave birth in the birth centre. In two UK trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>), 46% of women randomized to the birth centres actually gave birth in them. Thirty-four per cent of women in the Stockholm trial (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>) were transferred to standard care antenatally or intrapartum for medical reasons, and an additional 3% withdrew from birth centre care at their own request. In the Montreal trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>), 63% of nulliparous women and 19% of multiparous women were transferred intrapartum to standard care, for an overall transfer rate of 43%. In the London trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 1986</LINK>), 29% of 76 women were transferred from birth room to standard care. Transfers in the Toronto trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>) were for women's preference (n = 1) and at delivery if a caesarean delivery was to be performed (13% of 30 women). Permanent transfers from midwifery-led care in the Irish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2009</LINK>) included 505 women antenatally (most commonly for induction of labour), 144 during the intrapartum period (most commonly for complications or slow progress), and five postnatally, for an overall transfer rate of 59%. However, wherever possible, the woman's midwife remained with her after an intrapartum transfer of care. In the Norwegian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bernitz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bernitz 2011</LINK>), the transfer rate from the alternative setting was 28.4% (117 of 412).</P>

<P>With the exception of the quasi-random method (alternation) used in the smallest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>), all trials used adequate methods of sequence generation.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Women who were randomized to receive care in an alternative birth setting were more likely to labour and give birth without analgesia/anesthesia (six trials, n = 8953; risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), and more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (eight trials, n = 11,202; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Allocation to care in an alternative setting had no apparent effect on serious maternal morbidity/mortality (four trials, n = 6334; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.36) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). In oxytocin augmentation of labour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), the I² was 61%, &#964;² was 0.02, and the P value for the Chi² test of heterogeneity was 0.01. The majority of the observations came from very large trials, and visual inspection of the forest plots did not suggest inconsistency in the direction of effects. A sensitivity analysis, in which we removed the methodologically weakest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>), had no effect on heterogeneity. We have therefore reported the results of random-effects analyses. Women allocated to an alternative birth setting were less likely to have oxytocin augmentation of labour (eight trials, n = 11,131; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials which measured women's views of their care had at least 80% follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>), as noted above under <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>; none of the questions in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>) were conceptually similar to those used in the other two. Thus the meta-analysis results include only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>), and the measure used was whether the woman would prefer the same setting for a subsequent birth, (two trials, n = 1207; RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.15) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). Other measures of satisfaction with the childbirth experience reported in the trials included involvement in the process of birth, freedom to express feelings, support from midwives, and indicators of involvement in decision-making; all results either favoured those allocated to an alternative birth setting or suggested no differences.</P>
<P>Only five trials reported both perinatal mortality and serious perinatal morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>). We noted evidence of substantial heterogeneity: the &#964;² was 0.35, I² was 66%, and the P value for the Chi² test for heterogeneity was 0.05. We did not perform a sensitivity analysis, since the only trial which was methodologically weak (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1984</LINK>) contributed no adverse outcomes to the meta-analysis. Visual inspection of the forest plot showed that one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>) had effects in opposite directions to the other trials. Close examination of the trial reports failed to identify a reason why their results should not be combined. Comparison of results using a fixed-effect and random-effects model indicated results were comparable. We report the results of the random-effects model (five trials, n = 6385; RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

<P>All but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bernitz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bernitz 2011</LINK>), in which the staff of the alternative setting were separate from the staff of the conventional setting, also involved more continuity of caregiver in the alternative setting. We found no trials of freestanding birth centre care compared with conventional institutional settings, no trials of Snoezelen rooms, only one small (n = 62) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>) of an ambient room, and no trials of other architectural designs for labour rooms. Therefore, the subgroup analyses were confined to comparisons of trials in which either the same or separate midwifery/nursing staff provided care in the two settings.</P>
<P>In the four outcomes of interest in the subgroup analysis, there were no apparent effects, based on whether the same or separate staff cared for women in the two settings, on the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), Chi² test for subgroup differences 0.00, P = 0.94), serious perinatal morbidity/mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), Chi² test for subgroup differences 0.92, P = 0.34), or serious maternal morbidity/mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), Chi² test for subgroup differences 0.05, P = 0.83). It was not possible to draw conclusions in regard to women's views of their care, since the comparison involved one small trial (n = 62) in which the staff were the same (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>) with a large trial (n = 1927) in which there was separate staffing of the two units (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-22 10:26:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The benefits of alternative institutional settings for birth include increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, labour and birth without analgesia/anesthesia, breastfeeding at six to eight weeks postpartum, satisfaction with care, and decreased likelihood of oxytocin augmentation, assisted vaginal birth, caesarean birth, and episiotomy. The results are consistent with a growing body of research which has demonstrated the independent effects of physical attributes of the hospital room on caregivers&#8217; behaviour and patients&#8217; health outcomes, including postsurgical complications and length of stay (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004</LINK>). However, in several of the trials included in this review, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by important differences in the organizational models for care (separate staff for the alternative setting, offering more continuity of caregiver), and thus it is difficult to draw inferences about the independent effects of the physical birth environment. Furthermore, the effects of an alternative environment may be overpowered by routine institutional policies and practices (<LINK REF="REF-Fannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fannin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were only three trials in which losses to follow-up on questionnaires were low enough to permit inclusion of the data in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hundley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hundley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1997</LINK>), but similar results are reported in the other trials that measured satisfaction with care. Different measures were used in the trials, but the results pertaining to women's ratings of their birth experiences consistently favoured the group allocated to the alternative setting. Given the generally high rates of transfer from alternative settings to the conventional ward for intrapartum care, which presumably would create disappointment, these results strongly suggest higher levels of satisfaction in those allocated to alternative birth settings.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-05-10 15:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Although more than 11,000 women have participated in randomized trials of alternative birth settings, the low number of women allocated to alternative settings who actually gave birth in their allocated setting serves to dilute both the potential benefits and risks of alternative settings. Other important factors that complicate interpretation of the results are the variations in organizational models of care in the trials, including the potential impact of antenatal care, continuity of caregiver, and midwifery-led versus consultant-led care.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-26 14:56:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-05-10 15:54:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pregnant women should be informed that hospital birth centres are associated with lower rates of medical interventions during labour and birth and higher levels of satisfaction, without increasing risk to themselves or their babies. Decision-makers who wish to decrease rates of medical interventions for women experiencing normal pregnancies should consider developing birthing units with policies and practices to support normal labour and birth.</P>
<P>It was not possible to examine the separate influences of types of alternative hospital settings or continuity of caregiver, and there were no trials of freestanding birth centres. There were no apparent differences in effects, based on whether the same or separate staff provided care in the alternative and conventional units. Thus those who wish to develop a alternative birth setting, and those who wish to use them, have little to go on when making decisions about the autonomy of the setting or its architectural features. These issues are critically important, in light of women's reports of greater satisfaction with alternative institutional birth settings, and the lower rates of interventions associated with alternative settings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-26 14:56:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials should measure and report serious perinatal morbidity as well as perinatal mortality. It would also be helpful to consider the importance of ensuring high-quality inter-professional working relationships, with clear protocols for consultation and transfer of care. Future trials should also address the potential confounding effects of differences in the extent of continuity of caregiver in the alternative versus conventional birth settings. It would be helpful to have full descriptions of both the alternative and usual care interventions. And trials should include evidence-based approaches to encourage high response rates to postal questionnaires, as well as cost-effectiveness analyses.</P>
<P>Given the growing awareness of the importance of the birth environment, the escalating caesarean delivery rates in many high-income countries, and the favourable results of large observational studies of freestanding birth centres (e.g.<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2011</LINK>), randomized trials of freestanding birth centres are warranted. Similarly, adequately-powered trials are needed, of architectural designs which promote freedom of mobility and enhance feelings of calmness and control.</P>
<P>Questions have arisen about: the impact of competing philosophical, political, and administrative pressures on the operation of alternative settings (<LINK REF="REF-Annandale-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annandale 1987</LINK>); these questions require qualitative investigation. Qualitative studies, examining what happens when women are transferred from alternative to conventional birth settings, would shed light on the impact of transfer on women, care providers, and decision-making processes regarding the need for intervention. Questions which can be answered quantitatively include: the effects of alternative settings on birth outcomes, women's preferences for traditional labour ward care compared to birth centre care, the pros and cons of freestanding versus hospital-based birth centres, and the optimum organizational models of birth centre care. Evidence from both qualitative and quantitative sources is needed, to provide a complete picture of the nature, benefits, and risks of birth centre care.</P>

Envelopes were attached to the records of 7906 women and 3510 (44%) of those were considered eligible for the study. 8% of those randomized to the experimental group refused to participate in the trial.</P>

<P>The review authors comment about a "trend towards higher rates of perinatal mortality in the alternative settings" has been reported elsewhere in support of claims that birth centres are less safe than conventional settings for labour (1). A possible explanation for any real increase in perinatal mortality could be delayed transfer from the birth centre. We examined reports of the six trials included in the review and, as in the Cochrane review, found 41 perinatal deaths amongst women allocated birth centres. Only six of these deaths, however, were of normally formed babies who reached term. It is only these babies who were eligible to be born in a birth centre. Three of these six deaths were of women who had been allocated birth centre care but actually received standard labour care.</P>
<P>This raises questions about the validity of the underlying randomised trials. These studies have an experimental design where researcher control should ensure that people receive the specific treatment that was planned for them (2). The Cochrane Handbook gives no guidance on how to evaluate either the quality of the researchers' definition of the planned treatments, or the agreement between what treatment was actually provided and what the researcher planned (3). For the majority of the trials in this review the treatments are not adequately defined. Nor did they adequately control the treatments actually provided to each allocated group. It is not clear how any birth centre trial can sensibly be considered to have been scientifically controlled. The reviewers attempted to deal with this crucial point by claiming that they were only looking at the effect of the 'setting', but their objectives clearly state that they were examining the effect of "care within a setting".</P>
<P>In conclusion, this review is scientifically weak because of the weaknesses of the underlying trials.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-12-01 17:01:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We acknowledge in our Review that place of birth is a complex amalgamation of setting and care (and, indeed, philosophies of care) within that setting. We did not, and never intended to, distinguish 'setting' from 'care within the setting'. On the contrary, the two are indistinguishable, involving not only architectural differences but also different policies and procedures (and frequently, different care providers), compared to a conventional hospital labour ward.</P>
<P>We agree that one reason for excess perinatal mortality (if indeed it is a "true" excess) could be delayed transfer. But there may be other factors, such as those we raise in our Discussion. Systematic reviews, and randomized trials, report what happened but cannot tell one why it happened. The fact that some of the babies who died were antenatal transfers and not at term does not invalidate the Review, as it included the outcomes of women and babies from the point of trial entry, which, in some of the included studies, was early in pregnancy. Intention-to-treat captures all the outcomes consequent on the initial place of booking, as those are the outcomes that are likely to pertain for women in 'real life' who make similar booking decisions.</P>
<P>We point out in the Discussion that the high rates of transfer out of alternative settings serve to dilute both the potential benefits and risks. The issue here is not one of validity, but of the precision of the results. It would be unethical to keep women in their allocated form of care, regardless of subsequent changes in risk factors or preferences. The important question for women and providers is whether choosing a alternative setting is likely to be better or worse than choosing a conventional hospital setting. Making this judgment will include an assessment of the rates of transfer between settings, and of fetal and infant wellbeing at various stages of gestation. The package of care provided in alternative settings needs to be examined in conjunction with that delivered in the referral unit(s), since this is what women are potentially signing up for when they make their booking decision.</P>
<P>In our view, none of the points raised threaten the internal validity of the Review, but they do illustrate the turmoil that can arise when results are used to support the arguments of one faction or another without regard to the full context of a study, especially in a highly contested area like place of birth. We acknowledge the difficulties faced by both those who want to maximize choice for childbearing women, and those who are concerned about safety issues. We hope that a close reading of our introduction, methods, and discussion will reveal that we share some of the concerns of both groups of protagonists, and we hope that the design of future research in this area can benefit from on-going debates like the one we are addressing here.</P>
