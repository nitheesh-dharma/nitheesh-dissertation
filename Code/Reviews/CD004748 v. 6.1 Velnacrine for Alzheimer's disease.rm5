<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Velnacrine is a derivative of tacrine. There is evidence that it is toxic in a similar way to tacrine and all research stopped in 1994.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of velnacrine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 8 January 2004 using the terms velnacr* and 'HP 029'. The CDCIG SR is regularly updated and contains records from all major health care databases and a great many ongoing trial databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with velnacrine was administered for more than two weeks to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials, involving 899 participants, were included. Cutler 1990 reported only the adverse events, and omitted the results for the placebo group. Medication was stopped for all in the highest dose group after the fourth day because one member suffered a tonic seizure. It is not possible to report any comparisons with placebo. Antuono 1995 reported benefit for velnacrine at endpoint for the CGI-C, and the Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PGIR), but not for the Carers Assessment of Time Activity (CATS). These results could not be checked because the relevant information was not reported, and we cannot assess the effect on the results of the higher number of non-completers from the velnacrine group. Treatment was discontinued because of safety reasons in 135 patients, mostly due to an abnormal liver function tests. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number with an abnormal liver function test before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [105/297 vs 4/152, OR =20.23, 95% CI 7.29 to 56.18, p&lt;0.00001]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [130/297 vs 39/152, OR =2.26, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.47, p=0.0002]. </P>
<P>Results are available for the dose replication phases of Zemlan 1996a and Zemlan 1996b. All the patients had taken velnacrine within two weeks prior to this phase and were identified as responders to velnacrine defined by improvement on the ADAS-Cog. Both studies reported a significant benefit for velnacrine compared with placebo for the ADAS-cog, but the results could not be checked because the relevant information was not reported. Neither study reported any benefit for velnacrine for the other efficacy measures. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number with elevated liver transaminases before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [45/153 vs 29/156, OR =1.82, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.11, p=0.03]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [68/211 vs 47/215, OR =1.70, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.62, p=0.02]. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There has been no research into the use of velnacrine as a cognitive enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease since 1994.

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 16:18:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>Healthcare condition</B>
<BR/>Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. The slow, progressive decline is initially characterized by memory loss, followed by a more general cognitive decline, inability to perform activities of daily living, and behavioural symptoms, such as agitation, depression and anxiety.</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, belongs to a class of reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and belongs to the family of aminoacridines. In 1993 it became the first drug approved by the FDA for Alzheimer's dementia. Unfortunately it is associated with significant disadvantages, including low oral bio-availability and metabolism involving hepatic microsomal enzymes with a consequent risk of interactions with other drugs. Tacrine is also associated with adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. </P>
<P>Large numbers of analogues have been derived from tacrine, in the hope that they would have similar efficacy, but would be less toxic. Velnacrine maleate (Mentane, HP 029), a hydroxy derivative of tacrine (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridin-1-ol maleate), is a reversible, lipophilic cholinesterase inhibitor that is identical to the primary metabolite of tacrine. Velnacrine has reversed scopolamine induced dementia in animal models of cognitive dysfunction. In single dose studies in healthy male volunteers, velnacrine was well absorbed, and peak plasma levels were reached in approximately one hour, and the drug was eliminated rapidly with a half-life of about two hours (<LINK REF="REF-Puri-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puri 1989b</LINK>). The single highest dose of velnacrine that has been well tolerated is 100mg, and multiple-dose tolerance studies have shown that 300mg/day were not associated with clinically significant adverse events in healthy elderly men (<LINK REF="REF-Puri-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puri 1988</LINK>). Phase I studies have indicated that daily doses of up to 225 mg, given in three evenly divided doses are safe in treating patients with Alzheimer's disease. </P>
<P>
<B>Rationale for the review</B>
<BR/>There has been no research into the use of velnacrine as a cognitive enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease since 1994. Early data had indicated that velnacrine had a similar efficiency to that of tacrine but was less hepatotoxic. The FDA peripheral and CNS drug advisory board voted unanimously against recommending approval. This review is of historical importance only.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of velnacrine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized, trials of patients with Alzheimer's disease in which treatment with velnacrine was administered for longer than two weeks and compared with a placebo group were studied. Trials in which the allocation to treatment was not randomized, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed were excluded. This is because prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased allocation of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The patients in trials to be included were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease according to internationally accepted criteria such as DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>SELECTION OF STUDIES<BR/>Irrelevant citations were discarded by a review of the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that the article could possibly be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. One reviewer (JSB) selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. </P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>The same reviewer assessed the methodological quality of each trial with particular emphasis on the allocation concealment, which was ranked using the Cochrane approach: </P>
<P>Category A (adequate concealment) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administered sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; (or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment. </P>
<P>Category B (unclear) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a list or table to allocate assignments; (ii) use of envelopes or sealed envelopes; (iii) statement that the study was randomized without further detail. </P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments; no explicit assurance of randomization.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials are included if they conform to categories A or B, while those falling into category C are excluded. </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available. For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. </P>
<P>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior. </P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If ITT data were not available an analysis of patients who completed treatment was conducted. The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of ordered categories (more than 10) the data will be treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables which can be approximated to continuous variables, the main outcomes of interest were the assessment score at the time point being considered and the change from the baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) at this time point. For some binary and ordinal outcomes the endpoint category relative to baseline category was the outcome of interest. For other categorical outcomes, such as the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>), the endpoint itself was of clinical relevance as all patients had begun, by definition, at the same baseline score. The baseline assessment score was the latest available score, no longer than two months prior to the randomization. Studies may have included a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. The data from these non-randomized titration periods were not used to assess safety or efficacy since patients were not randomized, nor was treatment or dose allocation concealed. Data from any open follow-on phase, after the randomized phase, were not used to assess safety or efficacy for the same reasons.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. </P>
<P>When change from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome was the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test.<BR/>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio was used to measure treatment effect. </P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, functional and quality of life scales, there are two possible approaches. If ordinal scale data appear to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators perform suggests parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data. The second approach, which may not have excluded the first, was to concatenate into 2 categories which best represent the contrasting states of interest, and to treat the variable as binary. </P>
<P>A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials was calculated. Overall estimates of the treatment difference are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using I2 statistic performed. Where there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model is used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>

The studies were all supported by Hoechst- Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. and carried out in the USA. They were all randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group studies. Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease was made using NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>) in all four studies. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cutler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cutler 1990</LINK> recruited 24 people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, confirmed by neuropsychiatric testing using the modified Hachinski Ischaemia Scale, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>)and the Blessed Dementia Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Blessed-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessed 1968</LINK>), who were otherwise healthy. Patients were hospitalized for the 10-day study. They were randomized to placebo or one of three treatment groups. The maximum daily dose in the three treatment groups was 225, 300 and 450 mg/day, divided into three equal doses per day. Food intake was not allowed during the hour before and after taking a dose. All patients began with 60 mg/day and were titrated up to the maximum dose by the fifth day. Laboratory tests were performed at baseline, day four and on the final day. Vital signs and adverse events were monitored three times daily.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Antuono-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Antuono 1995</LINK> was a 24-week study, testing two doses of velnacrine, 150 and 225 mg/day (divided into 3 equal doses).

<B>OUTCOME MEASURES</B>
<BR/>The primary measures in the three studies other than <LINK REF="STD-Cutler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cutler 1990</LINK> were the cognitive part of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C). Secondary measures included the ADAS-Noncog, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living , the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS), the carer rated Patient's Global Improvement Rating (PGIR), and the Caregiver Activities Time Survey (CATS). Safety evaluations included vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events.

<P>No study provided details of the method of randomization but all included studies fulfilled Category B randomization criteria. </P>
<P>Non-completion of the double-blind phase was a serious problem in all studies. Thirty eight per cent of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Antuono-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Antuono 1995</LINK> did not complete the randomized treatment phase, mostly because of abnormal clinical laboratory values. Medication was stopped for all in the highest dose group of <LINK REF="STD-Cutler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cutler 1990</LINK> after the fourth day because one participant suffered a tonic seizure. The dose ranging study conducted before the dose replication study of <LINK REF="STD-Zemlan-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Zemlan 1996a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zemlan-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Zemlan 1996b</LINK> compromised the results of the latter. All patients had been taking velnacrine just before entering the latter phase.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cutler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cutler 1990</LINK> reported only the adverse events, but omitted the results for the placebo group. Medication was stopped for all in the highest dose group after the fourth day because one member suffered a tonic seizure. It is not possible to report any comparisons with placebo. The small numbers randomized to each group (n=6) would have severely limited precision of any comparisons.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Antuono-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Antuono 1995</LINK> reported very few results that could be confirmed. Graphs showed the mean values for ADAS-Cog and CGI-C at different time points for those who had not left the trial (completers) and reported treatment effects at end point but omitted the standard deviations of the values, and the number of people assessed at each point. End point was defined as the last evaluation while the patient was receiving the study drug in the double-blind treatment period. It was reported that the comparison of the combined velnacrine group showed benefit compared with placebo at end point for the CGI-C (treatment effect =-0.3, P=0.001), and the Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PSMS), but these results were not reproducible. A detailed analysis was reported of the Caregivers' Activity Time Survey (CATS), but unfortunately only 36% of the carers volunteered to provide details of the time they spent on a range of caring activities, and this could have introduced bias into the results. The results report that there is no benefit for the higher or lower dose of velnacrine compared with placebo for the total time spent caring at 24 weeks.</P>
<P>Treatment was discontinued because of safety reasons in 135 patients. The most common reason was abnormal liver function tests. There was significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number with an abnormal liver function test before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [105/297 vs 4/152, OR =20.23, 95% CI 7.29 to 56.18, p&lt;0.00001]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [130/297 vs 39/152, OR =2.26, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.47, p=0.0002]. Overall there was no difference between placebo and velnacrine for the number of adverse clinical events, but there was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number experiencing vomiting before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [10/297 vs 0/152, OR =4.68, 95% CI 1.25 to 17.56, p=0.02]. </P>
<P>Results are available for the dose replication phases of <LINK REF="STD-Zemlan-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Zemlan 1996a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zemlan-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Zemlan 1996b</LINK>. All the patients had taken velnacrine within two weeks prior to this phase. Both studies reported a significant benefit for velnacrine compared with placebo for the ADAS-cog, but the results could not be confirmed as the standard errors of the treatment effect, and the numbers of patients in each group were not reported. Neither study reported any benefit for velnacrine for the other efficacy measures.</P>
<P>There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number with elevated liver transaminases before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [45/153 vs 29/156, OR =1.82, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.11, p=0.03]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [68/211 vs 47/215, OR =1.70, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.62, p=0.02]. Overall there was no difference between placebo and velnacrine for the number of adverse clinical events, but there was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number experiencing diarrhoea before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [53/153 vs 33/156, OR =1.98, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.28, p=0.009]. <BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The evidence for the safety and efficacy of velnacrine comes from only four trials, with a total of 899 participants. The smallest trial, of 24 participants, examined tolerance and plasma levels using 3 dose groups and a placebo group, for 10 days. All medication was withdrawn from the highest dose group, 450mg/day, after 5 days due to a serious adverse event of toxic seizure suffered by one participant. The number and severity of adverse events appeared to be related to dose. Comparisons with the placebo group were not possible as the results for this group were not reported. </P>
<P>Two other studies randomized to treatment only those they identified as treatment responders (309 and 117 patients). The studies began with a screening visit, followed by 2 weeks on placebo, and then patients were treated with placebo, 30, 75, 150, 225 mg/day of velnacrine for one week each in a random order. Patients who improved by 4 points or more on the ADAS-Cog compared with the screening value were eligible to proceed to the next part of the trial. After 2 weeks placebo washout patients were randomized to placebo or their best dose (that on which they achieved their best ADAS-Cog score) for 6 weeks of treatment. It was not possible to judge the results of the cognitive tests as inadequate data were reported. Although significantly more patients suffered adverse events, and raised liver transaminases, it was difficult to interpret the results relating to adverse events as all participants had recently taken high doses of velnacrine. </P>
<P>The fourth study confirmed the results for adverse events and abnormal liver function tests. </P>
<P>These studies indicate that the results for velnacrine were disappointing and that it is not an improvement on tacrine as was hoped.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There has been no research into the use of velnacrine as a cognitive enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease since 1994. The FDA peripheral and CNS drug advisory board voted unanimously against recommending approval. </P>
<P>This review confirms the toxic nature of velnacrine, and provides no evidence of efficacy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There are no grounds for further research into velnacrine.</P>
