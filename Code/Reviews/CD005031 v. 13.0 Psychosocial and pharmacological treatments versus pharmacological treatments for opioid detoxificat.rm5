<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-28 11:59:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>People who abuse opioid drugs and become dependent on them experience social issues and health risks. Medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are substituted to help dependent drug users detoxify and return to living drug free, by reducing physiological withdrawal symptoms (pharmacological detoxification). Yet psychological symptoms can occur during detoxification and may be distressing. It is often a personal crisis that led to a drug user deciding to detoxify. Furthermore the psychological reasons why a person became addicted are important. They may not be able to cope with stress and have come to expect that using mood modifying illicit substances helps. Even after successful return to a drug-free state, many people return to heroin use and re-addiction is a substantial problem in rehabilitation. The physiological, behavioural and social conditions in an individual's life that made them an opiate addict may still be present when physical dependence on the drug has been eliminated, which makes psychosocial therapy important. Psychosocial treatments include behavioural treatments, counselling and family therapy.<BR/>The review authors searched the medical literature and found evidence that providing a psychosocial treatment in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatment to adults who are dependent on heroin use is effective in facilitating opioid detoxification. This conclusion is based on eleven controlled studies involving 1592 adults. The addition of a psychosocial treatment to substitution detoxification treatment improved the number of people who completed treatment (relative risk (RR) 1.47), reduced the use of opiate (RR 0.82), increased abstinence from opiate at follow up (RR 2.43) and halved the number of failures to attend clinic absences (RR 0.48). The findings of an improved rate of clinical attendance may help in suppressing illicit drug use and provides clinical staff with more opportunities to counsel patients in psychiatric, employment and other drug and non-drug related areas. Variations in the populations who are substance users and use of a wide range of different psychosocial interventions means that it is difficult to single out particular therapeutic interventions.</P>

<P>Different pharmacological approaches aimed at opioid detoxification are effective. Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse to heroin use, and relapses are a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of heroin users. Some studies have suggested that the sorts of symptoms which are most distressing to addicts during detoxification are psychological rather than physiological symptoms associated with the withdrawal syndrome.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any pharmacological interventions versus any pharmacological alone for opioid detoxification, in helping patients to complete the treatment, reduce the use of substances and improve health and social status.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-21 15:47:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Eleven studies, 1592 participants, fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. The studies considered five different psychosocial interventions and two pharmacological treatments (methadone and buprenorphine). Compared to any pharmacological treatment alone, the association of any psychosocial with any pharmacological was shown to significantly reduce dropouts RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85), use of opiate during the treatment, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.93), at follow up RR 0.66 (95% IC 0.53 to 0.82) and clinical absences during the treatment RR 0.48 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.59). Moreover, with the evidence currently available, there are no data supporting a single psychosocial approach.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-22 10:11:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Psychosocial treatments offered in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatments are effective in terms of completion of treatment, use of opiate, participants abstinent at follow-up and clinical attendance. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct psychosocial approaches that might make detoxification more effective.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-28 12:04:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-22 09:03:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-20 12:14:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Substance dependence continues to be a major clinical and social problem affecting millions of people worldwide and causing substantial costs to society.<BR/>Drug dependence has been described by the World Health Organization as "a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena of variable intensity, in which the use of a psychoactive drug (or drugs) takes on a high priority. The necessary descriptive characteristics are preoccupation with a desire to obtain and take the drug and persistent drug-seeking behaviour. Determinants and the problematic consequences of drug dependence may be biological, physiological or social, and usually interact." (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Abuse and dependence on opioid drugs are major health and social issues in most societies.The UNODC estimates the total number of opiates users at the global level between 15.2-21.1 million people (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2007</LINK>). More than half of the world&#8217;s opiates using population are thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the population aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes out of Afghanistan.</P>
<P>Trends in use appear to indicate a stabilisation of the overall number of heroin users in Europe, but recent data on drug induced deaths are mostly associated with opioid use (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2009</LINK>). The largest heroin using population in the Americas is found in the USA where approximately 1.2 million heroin users (0.6% of the population aged 15-64) have been estimated (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-20 12:14:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Data from literature and clinical experience, suggest that different pharmacological approaches aimed at detoxification are effective. Detoxification treatments may attenuate the withdrawal symptoms until the achievement of a drug free state. Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse in heroin use, and relapse from the drug-free state to re-addiction is a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of dependent heroin users.</P>
<P>The difficulty for drug addicts in maintaining a drug-free state makes the psychological process underlying addiction particularly important in developing treatments and their importance is becoming increasingly apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1986</LINK>). The continued use of illicit substance reflects the drug addict's continuing inability to cope with stress. In this category of patients, the process of affective states elaboration is often delegated to an external factor such as a substance mood modifier. The substance abuse is reinforced by the positive expectancies towards the drug's effectiveness in reducing the stress due to the deficiencies in coping with situational demands (<LINK REF="REF-Castellani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castellani 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of the population with substance use disorders, and the wide range of different psychosocial interventions, makes it very difficult to identify a particular therapeutic intervention as the gold-standard in this area. Hence this review will be comprehensive in the list of interventions which will be considered with the aim of including every type of psychosocial intervention provided to patients during detoxification. No a priori choice will be made, since the scope of the review is to explore if psychosocial treatments contribute to the achievements of the expected outcomes, rather than ranking the different treatments. Should one of the treatments considered appear to prevail, it will be reviewed separately.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-07-22 09:03:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group has conducted six reviews on detoxification treatments of opioid dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009 b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2009</LINK>). Some of the trials included in these reviews suggested that the provision of psychosocial support along with pharmacological therapy may help the success of the interventions.</P>
<P>Improvements in the methadone withdrawal response may be achieved through the provision of more information, counselling and other supporting services. Indeed these other services, by encouraging realistic expectations and setting short term goals, might be as important as the pharmacological therapy in determining treatment outcomes.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-20 12:20:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>In the published literature we did not find any systematic review assessing the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention plus pharmacological intervention aimed at detoxification.</P>
<P>Psychosocial treatments for opioid abuse or dependence are a critical component of the overall treatment package and require evaluation as stand-alone intervention but also in combination with pharmacotherapies. This current review focuses on psychosocial treatments delivered in association with pharmacological detoxification treatment, to determine if the psychosocial treatments are effective in influencing adherence to treatment and in reducing relapse rates. In parallel with this review, there are other two partner reviews. The first looks at the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions plus pharmacological maintenance interventions for opiate dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2008-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2008 a</LINK>). The second looks at the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions alone for opiate dependence and abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Mayet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayet 2004</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-28 12:03:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The risk of bias assessment for RCTs was performed using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Review is a two-part tool, addressing seven specific domains, namely sequence generation and  allocation concealment selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias) blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias) , incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) selective outcome reporting (reporting bias) and other source of bias. The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgments we will use the criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to  the addiction field. See Appendix  for details.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation and  allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) were addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants and, personnel (avoidance of performance bias) were not assessed because it was not feasible for the kind of intervention. Blinding of outcome assessor (avoidance of detection bias) were considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. drop out, use of substance of abuse measured by urine-analysis, subjects relapsed at the end of follow up, subjects engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were considered for all outcomes except for the drop out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for criteria used to assess risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Grading of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was assessed according to GRADE method (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>), a method systematic and explicit. In order to indicate the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct, judgments about the quality of evidence are made for each comparison and outcome. These judgments consider study design (RCT, quasi RCT or observational study), study quality (detailed study design and execution), consistency of results (similarity of estimates of effect across studies), precision of estimates, and directness (the extent to which people, interventions and outcome measures are similar to those of interest). The following definitions in grading the quality of evidence for each outcome are used: High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-07-28 12:03:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The completion of treatment was reported as the number of patients that completed the detoxification program. The use of primary substance was reported as number of participants with positive urinalysis during the treatment. The results at follow up were reported as the number of participants abstinent at follow up (follow up period: six months).</P>
<P>Dichotomous outcomes were analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR) for each trial, with the uncertainty in each result expressed with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were analysed by calculating the weighted mean difference (MD) or the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%CI. For outcomes assessed by scales we compared and pooled the mean score differences from the end of treatment to baseline (post minus pre) in the experimental and control group. In case of missing data about the standard deviation of the change we imputed this measure using the standard deviation at the end of treatment for each group.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-07-18 17:06:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>We didn't use data presented as number of positive urine tests over total number of tests in the experimental and control group as a measure of substance abuse. This is because using the number of tests instead of the number of participants as the unit of analysis violates the hypothesis of independence among observations. In fact, the results of tests done in each participant are not independent.</P>
<P>If all arms in a multi-arm trial are to be included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm is to be included in more than one of the treatment comparisons, then we divided the number of events and the number of participants in that arm by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method avoid the multiple use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial. It compromises the precision of the pooled estimate slightly.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-18 17:06:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Statistically significant heterogeneity among primary outcome studies was assessed with Chi-squared (Q) test and I-squared (Higgins 2008). A significant Q ( P&lt;.05) and I-squared of at least 50% was considered as statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-18 17:06:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>We used funnel plots (plots of the effect estimate from each study against the sample size or effect standard error) to assess the potential for bias related to the size of the trials, which could indicate possible publication bias</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-07-18 17:06:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The outcome measures from the individual trials were combined through meta-analysis where possible (clinical comparability of intervention and outcomes between trials) using a fixed-effect model unless there is significant statistical heterogeneity, in which case a random-effects model was used.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-07-28 06:53:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>To incorporating quality assessment in the review process we first plotted intervention effects estimates for different outcomes stratified for risk. If differences in results were present among studies at different risk of bias, we then performed sensitivity analysis excluding from the analysis studies with high risk of bias. We also   performed subgroup analysis for studies with low and unclear risk of bias.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-28 12:04:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The results of this review show that psychosocial treatments offered in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatments are effective in terms of completion of treatment, use of opiate and participants abstinent at follow-up. Their effectiveness seems to be stronger than those observed if these treatments were associated with maintenance treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2008-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2008 a</LINK>). This may be because maintenance treatments have robust effects and furthermore counselling is usually offered along with methadone. Another possible explanation is that participants in detoxification are less stable - it is usually a personal crisis that brings them into detoxification - and they have more issues that need to be dealt with. If psychosocial interventions delivered in association with detoxification helps them to deal with these issues, then it seems reasonable to expect that the provision of associated psychosocial interventions might improve the outcomes of detoxification.</P>
<P>In fact, there is no evidence that detoxification can substitute for long term treatment in the management of opiate addiction. Research suggests that relapse to opiate use is not entirely determined by avoidance of, or escape from withdrawal symptoms. Therefore a treatment that exclusively attenuates the severity of opiate withdrawal symptoms can be at best partially effective. Many if not most of the physiological, behavioural and social conditions prevailing during an individual's life as an opiate addict will still be present when the physical dependence has been eliminated.</P>
<P>Furthermore, once methadone has been removed, opiates will likely recover the reinforcing properties that previously sustained self administration and it is under those conditions that relapse is likely to occur. Yet, outpatient detoxification from opiate is a quick, inexpensive and common procedure that helps individuals by ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, and by temporarily reducing health risk associated with drugs. In addition, detoxification constitutes the first instance of contact of many addicts with the various treatment services available, and may facilitate transition into long term care. Given that methadone detoxification is such a widely used procedure, it appears reasonable to attempt to develop more efficacious detoxification techniques and to add psychosocial interventions to detoxification techniques seems to improve this procedure.</P>
<P>Particularly interesting are the findings of a high rate of clinical attendance by participants with the associated interventions, not only for suppressing illicit drug use, but also because it provides clinical staff with more opportunities to counsel patients in psychiatric, employment and other drug and non-drug related areas.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-28 07:01:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Eleven studies, 1592 participants, fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. The studies considered five different psychosocial interventions and two pharmacological treatments (methadone and buprenorphine). Compared to any pharmacological treatment alone, the association of any psychosocial with any pharmacological was shown to significantly reduce dropouts RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85), use of opiate during the treatment, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.93), at follow up RR 0.66 (95% IC 0.53 to 0.82) and clinical absences during the treatment RR 0.48 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.59).</P>
<P>For the single psychosocial interventions utilized, it was possible to pool data only for Contingency Management approaches and for Psychotherapeutic Counselling. When contingency management is combined with pharmacological treatments, results on dropouts, use of opiate and clinical absences remained all significantly in favour of the associated treatment. The same happened also for psychotherapeutic counselling although, in this case, it was possible to pool data only for dropouts. Moreover, with the evidence currently available, there are no data supporting a single psychosocial approach,</P>
<P>For the other three outcomes considered in single included studies (engagement in further treatments, use of other drugs and mortality) it was not possible to pool the data. The engagement in further treatments was considered in <LINK REF="STD-Rawson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rawson 1983</LINK>, 50 participants and results were in favour of associated treatment; the use of other drug was considered in <LINK REF="STD-Bickel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bickel 1997</LINK>, 39 participants and the results for all the substances considered were never significant; mortality was considered in <LINK REF="STD-Yandoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yandoli 2002</LINK> , 119 participants, and again the results were not statistically significant but the low number of events do not permit to draw serious conclusions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-07-25 09:51:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Considering the applicability, the evidence produced come from eleven studies, that included 1592 opiate addicts, mainly male (67%). The majority of studies included in the reviews were conducted in North America (91%). The main threat to applicability comes from the clinical setting, particularly the social and cultural context in which the studies were conducted, and this is particularly true in the field of addiction, where these contexts can actively affect the overall treatment outcome. To be sure of the results produced we would need to summarize results from studies developed and conducted in different Countries and this was not possible in this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-07-25 09:58:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Overall the methodological quality of the retrieved studies could be judged as moderate. The vast majority of studies did not report information about protection against selection and detection bias. All but three studies were at low risk of attrition bias, and all but three reported all the expected outcomes for a study on the effectiveness of treatment of opioid dependence.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence of any psychosocial plus any pharmacological Intervention versus any pharmacological alone, assessed according to GRADE method, be judged as moderate to high for acceptability outcome (dropouts) and for the efficacy outcomes (use of opiate during the treatment and at follow up) and as moderate for compliance, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-22 10:11:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Psychosocial treatments offered in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatments are effective in terms of completion of treatment, use of opiate, participants abstinent at follow-up and clinical attendance. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct psychosocial approaches that might make detoxification more effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Limitations to this review are imposed by the heterogeneity of the assessment of outcomes. Due to lack of detailed information, it was not possible to perform a meta analysis to analyse the results related to several outcomes. <BR/>Problems in generalisation of the results call for further research, which should be conducted in a way that standardizes the way in which specific outcomes are measured and reported. </P>

<B>Contingency Management Approaches: </B>
</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Contingency Management is a behavioural treatment based on positive/negative reinforcers used to promote abstinence in participants in treatment. With positive reinforcers, the participants can obtain payment for drug-free urine (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCaul-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCaul 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robles 2002</LINK>), or methadone dose increases (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 1986</LINK>). A variant of this approach is the Community Reinforcement Approach, a behavioural treatment that consists of two interventions: Community Reinforcement associated with Contingency Management. The Community Reinforcement consists of two to three individual counselling sessions of one hour per week; during therapy sessions, participants were provided with relationship and employment counselling, instructions on antecedents and consequences of their opiate use, assistance in developing new or reinitiating old recreational activities (<LINK REF="STD-Bickel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bickel 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>These interventions are both behavioural approaches, which are in line with the reinforcement principles. Contingency Management uses formal clinic-managed reinforcers (vouchers), while in the Community Reinforcement Approach often significant others are mobilised to administer reinforcers contingent on non-substance using behavior (alternatives) of the patient.</P>

<B>Counselling:</B>
</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Psychotherapeutic counselling: This counselling entails the assessment of individual patient needs and the provision of services to meet these needs. The intervention does not consider intrapsychic processes. (<LINK REF="STD-Rawson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rawson 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intensive Role induction with or without case management,:Intensive role induction consists of individual counselling sessions focused on psycho education about detoxification, addressing misperceptions about detox and barriers to continued enrolment in treatment, emphasizing the value of continuing in treatment beyond detox.. Case management consists of assistance from the counsellor in accessing community resources that would support their effort at recovery.; it is focused in helping patients to found concrete services available. (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P>Counselling and education on high risk behavior, IndividuaL HIV risk prevention designed to reduce risk behavior through education and by encouraging treatment participation (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2009</LINK>)</P>
<P>Therapeutic Alliance Intervention: intervention focused on mutual agreement about treatment goal and the development of a positive bond between patients and counsellor. Engagement in outpatient services was chosen as the goal of the TA. 45-50 minutes single session conducted by an outpatient counsellor :including discussion of a plan after detoxification, life goal and possible treatment goal, developing confidence in goal attachment. (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2009</LINK>)</P>

<I>
<B>Family Therapy: </B>
</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Family therapy is a structured and strategic approach which places particular emphasis on developing appropriate boundaries and limits before introducing a strategic intervention. If the patient was in a relationship, the therapist worked primarily with the couple. However, other significant relationships were also included in the discussion during the sessions, and other family members were also invited to attend some sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Yandoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yandoli 2002</LINK>).</P>
