<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Worldwide, between 80,000 and 100,000 young people start smoking every day. Many adolescent tobacco programmes focus on preventing teenagers from starting to smoke, but some programmes have been aimed at helping those teenagers who are already smoking to quit. We set out to investigate whether these programmes can help young people quit smoking for six months or longer. Searches are up to date as of June 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 41 studies (around 13,000 participants) that researched ways of helping teenagers to quit smoking. These studies were of mixed quality and looked at various methods for stopping smoking, including one-to-one counselling, counselling as part of a group, methods using computers or text messaging, or a combination of these. Four studies used drug treatments such as nicotine patches. Most studies recruited participants from schools, and 29 of the studies were carried out in North America.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Although some programmes showed promise, especially those that used group counselling and those that combined a variety of approaches, there was no strong evidence that any particular method was effective in helping young people to stop smoking. Trials differed in how they measured whether a person had quit smoking, and many trials did not have enough participants for us to be confident about wider application of the results. Medications such as nicotine replacement and bupropion were not shown to be successful with adolescents, and some adverse events were reported, although these events were generally mild and findings were based on studies with small numbers of participants. Based on these findings we cannot currently identify a programme for helping adolescents to stop smoking that is more successful than trying to stop unaided.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low or very low for all of the outcomes in this review. This is because of issues with the quality of some of the studies, the small number of studies and participants for some outcomes, and the differences between the studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Most tobacco control programmes for adolescents are based around prevention of uptake, but teenage smoking is still common. It is unclear if interventions that are effective for adults can also help adolescents to quit. This is the update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of strategies that help young people to stop smoking tobacco.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register in June 2017. This includes reports for trials identified in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsyclNFO.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We included individually and cluster-randomized controlled trials recruiting young people, aged under 20 years, who were regular tobacco smokers. We included any interventions for smoking cessation; these could include pharmacotherapy, psycho-social interventions and complex programmes targeting families, schools or communities. We excluded programmes primarily aimed at prevention of uptake. The primary outcome was smoking status after at least six months' follow-up among those who smoked at baseline.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of candidate trials and extracted data. We evaluated included studies for risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodology and grouped them by intervention type and by the theoretical basis of the intervention. Where meta-analysis was appropriate, we estimated pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, based on the quit rates at six months' follow-up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-10 10:23:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>Forty-one trials involving more than 13,000 young people met our inclusion criteria (26 individually randomized controlled trials and 15 cluster-randomized trials). We judged the majority of studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Interventions were varied, with the majority adopting forms of individual or group counselling, with or without additional self-help materials to form complex interventions. Eight studies used primarily computer or messaging interventions, and four small studies used pharmacological interventions (nicotine patch or gum, or bupropion). There was evidence of an intervention effect for group counselling (9 studies, risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.77), but not for individual counselling (7 studies, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.39), mixed delivery methods (8 studies, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66) or the computer or messaging interventions (pooled RRs between 0.79 and 1.18, 9 studies in total). There was no clear evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, although confidence intervals were wide (nicotine replacement therapy 3 studies, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.58; bupropion 1 study RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.02). No subgroup precluded the possibility of a clinically important effect. Studies of pharmacotherapies reported some adverse events considered related to study treatment, though most were mild, whereas no adverse events were reported in studies of behavioural interventions. Our certainty in the findings for all comparisons is low or very low, mainly because of the clinical heterogeneity of the interventions, imprecision in the effect size estimates, and issues with risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>There is limited evidence that either behavioural support or smoking cessation medication increases the proportion of young people that stop smoking in the long-term. Findings are most promising for group-based behavioural interventions, but evidence remains limited for all intervention types. There continues to be a need for well-designed, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>In much of the developed world, the prevalence of smoking amongst young people has been falling over the last 20 years. Recent figures from the UK show that for children under the age of 16 years, 18% have tried smoking at least once and 3% are regular smokers, but that regular cigarette smoking has fallen from a peak of around 12% of children aged 11 to 15 years in the mid-1990s (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2017</LINK>).  A similar decline has been noted in the USA; in 2016, 13.8% of high school students and 4.3% of middle school students reported current use of combustible tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2017</LINK>), compared with a prevalence of more than 30% 20 years earlier (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2012</LINK>). In developing economies the picture is less clear cut, with wide variation and often higher rates of smoking in young people, including rates of up to 50% in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 2015</LINK>). The incidence of the initiation of smoking first becomes measurable in the 10- to 12-year age range (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2000</LINK>), and smoking in teenage years is strongly predictive of adult smoking (<LINK REF="REF-HSCIC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSCIC 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the major burden of disease caused by smoking falls on the adult population, there are several reasons why smoking cessation interventions that are effective in younger smokers are particularly valuable. Firstly, many adult smokers started smoking in childhood (in the UK, 40% of regular smokers began smoking before the age of 16 years (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2017</LINK>)). However, many of the adverse health effects associated with smoking are preventable with cessation at a young age (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2004</LINK>), and there is little loss in life expectancy provided cessation occurs early enough (<LINK REF="REF-Jha-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jha 2014</LINK>). There are therefore substantial cumulative potential health benefits to be gained from successful interventions in this age group, as well as the prospect of reducing the demand for cessation services among adult smokers who have been smoking since childhood.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is evidence that those who start earliest and continue to smoke may be more susceptible to disease in adulthood than smokers who start later in life, facing increased risks of lung damage, bowel cancer, and cervical pre-cancerous lesions (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2017</LINK>). There is also evidence that, although levels of dependence may be lower in young smokers than in the adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Rubinstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinstein 2007</LINK>), addiction to nicotine can develop very rapidly in young smokers, making unassisted quitting difficult even among those without a long smoking history (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirdly, there is evidence that within a short time of commencing, many teenage smokers want to quit (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 1998</LINK>). Frequent quit attempts are reported in this population (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanton 2001</LINK>), with many studies reporting more than 50% of teenage smokers making a quit attempt within six months, although many of these attempts are unsuccessful (<LINK REF="REF-Bancej-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancej 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fourthly, smoking may be a particular problem in young people with mental health or behavioural problems. In the UK, smoking rates among 11- to 15-year-olds were 30% in those with conduct disorder, 19% in those with emotional disorder, and 15% in those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 5% in those without such disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thakur-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thakur 2012</LINK>).There is now strong evidence that the relationship is causal with respect to depression (<LINK REF="REF-Boden-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boden 2010</LINK>), whilst for ADHD molecular genetics would seem to play a role.</P>
<P>There is now a large literature on smoking cessation services for adults. This is reflected in a number of Cochrane Reviews examining several aspects of the subject in detail. Many countries have developed appropriate services for adults. However, whilst some have suggested that similar services, suitably modified, should be considered for young people (<LINK REF="REF-Raw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raw 1998</LINK>), this assertion is open to challenge in view of the difference in smoking pattern, lifestyle and attitudes to services in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-TAG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAG 2000</LINK>). Previous reviews of adolescent smoking cessation have been published, comprising randomized controlled (experimental) trials and non-randomized, 'quasi-experimental' or observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patnode-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patnode 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2006</LINK>). This update, restricted to evidence from randomized controlled trials, is the third version of a Cochrane Review to focus on smoking cessation in young people under 20 years. A further systematic review has looked at strategies for smoking cessation for university-age smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Villanti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanti 2010</LINK>). The paucity of high-quality research evidence to answer important clinical questions is a recurrent theme of reviews in this area.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane Reviews of interventions relevant to tobacco addiction amongst young people have mainly focused on primary prevention. These include a review of school-based prevention programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2012</LINK>), and reviews of mass media interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2017</LINK>), community interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2011</LINK>), interventions for reducing access by preventing illegal sale of tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>), prevention in indigenous youth (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012</LINK>), and school smoking policies (<LINK REF="REF-Coppo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coppo 2012</LINK>). This review looks at strategies for smoking cessation in young people and, more specifically, at the context in which the interventions are offered, and how young people are enrolled into quit attempts.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Participants were young people, aged under 20 years, who were regular, current tobacco smokers. As there is evidence that some young people have an irregular pattern of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Loughlin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Loughlin 2003</LINK>), we have defined a regular smoker in this review as a young person who smokes an average of at least one cigarette a week, and has done so for at least six months. Trials did not always specify smoking status to this level of detail, but we excluded trials known to target young people who smoked less than this or known to include as 'smokers' people who did not currently smoke, but had smoked in the past.</P>
<P>If a study included participants beyond their 20th birthday (for example, 16- to 21-year-olds), we have included the study if the majority of participants were aged under 20, and if the design of the programme specifically considered the needs of young people.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusions</HEADING>
<P>We have excluded from this review interventions specifically targeting young women in pregnancy, since this topic is covered by the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2015</LINK>). We have also excluded any programme aimed primarily at the adult population, and have contacted investigators where there was a lack of clarity on this issue.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Interventions could be specifically designed to meet the needs of young people aged under 20 years, or could also be applicable to adults. Interventions could range from simple ones such as pharmacotherapy, targeting individual young people, through strategic programmes targeting people or organizations associated with young people (for example, their families or schools), to complex programmes targeting the community in which young people study or live, provided the study reported outcomes related to the individual smoker.</P>
<P>To be included, all interventions had to be aimed at helping young people to stop smoking tobacco. We included cessation programmes and strategies that also targeted relapse. We included programmes or strategies that targeted psycho-social determinants (for example, enhancing self-efficacy for refusing tobacco), or that focused on developing life skills in order to stay abstinent, if the study design was appropriate. We did not place any restrictions on the setting in which the intervention was offered, for example, school, hospital, doctor's surgery, or dentist.</P>
<P>We excluded smoking prevention programmes, even if they reported cessation data, as they have been the subject of previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carson-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2012</LINK>). Within large-scale, community primary prevention interventions, health-education programmes/curricula or mass media campaigns that targeted young people, we only considered for inclusion the cessation component of those programmes, where the following three criteria were met: that part of the intervention had been specifically designed to target cessation; that the interventions could be separately assessed; and that the interventions explicitly met the criteria of this review for study design and recruitment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control conditions</HEADING>
<P>Interventions in the control arm of the study could be one of the following:</P>

<LI>no intervention;</LI>
<LI>delayed intervention beyond the last date of data acquisition including follow-up;</LI>
<LI>information on stopping smoking either delivered to individuals in control groups or as literature (indicated in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> as 'brief Intervention');</LI>
<LI>general tobacco education given to all participants in trial.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of quitting</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome of interest was change in smoking behaviour (being a smoker at baseline and becoming an ex-smoker at follow-up) at six months' follow-up or longer. We excluded trials with follow-up of less than six months. In trials that reported data at multiple follow-up times, we chose for the primary analysis the shortest follow-up of at least six months that used the most rigorous available definition of abstinence. We have not included relapse rates in the review.</P>
<P>We have reported the definition of cessation used in each trial, for example abstinence during a particular period, such as in the past seven or 30 days (point prevalence), abstinence from the start of the programme (continuous abstinence), or abstinence following occasional relapse in the two-week, post-treatment grace period (prolonged abstinence) (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). If studies reported cessation using more than one definition of abstinence we used the most rigorous outcome. Biochemical confirmation of self-reported non-smoking is generally taken to be the gold standard for reporting of quit rates (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). This tests for the presence of smoking-related substances in exhaled breath, saliva, urine or blood, and is the preferred verification method for reported outcomes where this is available. It should be noted that biochemical validation may not be a very sensitive measure of change in smoking status for irregular smokers; it is possible that some studies may have recruited participants on the basis of self-reported smoking status who would not have been identified as smokers at baseline if biochemical validation had been used.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We used the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group search strategies to identify randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized controlled trials, and controlled trials of smoking cessation and prevention interventions. Trials relevant to the review were identified using the free text and keywords 'Child' or 'adolescent*' or 'adolescence'. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register on 8 June 2017. At the time of the search the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL; 2016, issue 11); MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20170526; Embase (via OVID) to week 201724; PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20170529. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/sect0-meta.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> in the Cochrane Library for full search strategies and a list of other resources searched. We have also searched the 'grey literature' (unpublished resources and conference proceedings) and the reference lists of identified studies.</P>
<P>Where necessary, we have contacted the authors of existing trials and other experts for ongoing trials, and for unpublished results pertaining to completed trials, subject to the availability of peer review.</P>
<P>For previous updates, we also contacted smoking cessation e-networks with a list of the references to extracted studies, to request verification and any additional information, and contacted manufacturers of smoking cessation products.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We drew up a prospective list of eligibility criteria with two levels of priority: essential and desirable. For the initial review, two original authors (GG and AS; see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>) assessed the retrieved abstracts against this list for possible inclusion, to measure the feasibility of each criterion.</P>
<P>After piloting, we applied the agreed criteria to the abstracts of all studies extracted from the databases. We then categorized studies into three groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>both authors agree on inclusion based on the abstract;</LI>
<LI>one author suggests inclusion based on the abstract;</LI>
<LI>both authors agree on exclusion based on the abstract.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We retrieved full-text articles for groups 1 and 2. We used the processes outlined here and later for all updates.</P>
<P>Two authors independently assessed each full article, using the agreed inclusion criteria. For studies where there was disagreement, the editorial base or a third author was consulted to reach a consensus. Where there was ambiguity in trial reporting or lack of data, we contacted investigators for clarification where possible. If we could not retrieve missing data, a study may have been excluded on that basis.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We summarized the effect size for each individual study as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The RR is calculated as (number quit in intervention group/number randomized to intervention)/(number quit in control group/number randomized to control), with participants randomized but lost to follow-up regarded as non-abstinent.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Outcomes of all cluster randomized trials were given at the participant level, that is, the unit of analysis was different from that used for randomization. We checked whether the study authors' analysis used a method to account for clustering effects, such as multi-level modelling. If the analysis clearly stated that they had made an allowance for clustering, or had examined the clustering effect but found it to be negligible, we extracted the effect size and standard error (or 95% CI) reported in the paper, converting odds ratios to approximate RRs if necessary. Otherwise, if a trial was cluster-randomized but the study authors had not allowed for this in the published analysis, we extracted the log-RR and its standard error and the average cluster size, and adjusted it using an assumed inter-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.03, a similar value to that estimated in several of the included studies.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>It is a frequent feature of analysis of smoking cessation studies that cases lost to follow-up are assumed to be still smoking. Several authors discussed this issue and made adjustments in the analysis (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joffe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joffe 2009</LINK>) and/or analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis, that is, including all participants in the groups to which they were originally randomized, and classifying those lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. In this review we also counted cases lost to follow-up as current smokers, even if the primary studies had not explicitly done this. One other reason for data being unavailable for the review was a tendency for study authors to report results as percentages, sometimes without any particular clarity as to the denominator. Some of the results of our analysis have therefore been imputed from percentages, assuming the denominator to be the number of participants randomized. Where possible, we have contacted study authors to ask for verification of the calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>We pooled groups of studies that we consider to be sufficiently similar in their interventions, comparison groups, setting, and participants, provided that there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity as assessed by the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Specifically, we have presented results for groups of studies characterized by the mode of delivery of the intervention, the theoretical basis underpinning the intervention, and according to the pharmacotherapy used (where applicable). We estimated a pooled RR using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model, based on the quit rates at follow-up. Where meta-analysis was not appropriate, we have presented summary and descriptive statistics. For studies for which we were unable to obtain reliable numerical data, we have reported the main results narratively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Theoretical basis of intervention</HEADING>
<P>It was difficult to stratify many of the studies into categories corresponding to a single theoretical model that formed the basis of the intervention, and for some studies no relevant information was available. One intervention, conducted in 1978, used the health promotion strategies of that period (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1978</LINK>). However, many interventions were complex and used combinations of psycho-social theories (see <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK> for discussion of management of reviews of complex interventions). Constructs relating to motivational enhancement and strategies for resisting cultural and social pressures were the most common.

<P>As can be expected from a cohort where most participants were in formal education, recruitment for studies mainly occurred within schools (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalum-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dalum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gungormus-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gungormus 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joffe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joffe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NoT-MD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">NoT MD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NoT-WV-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NoT WV 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Milena-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Milena 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_4-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-4 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherphof-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Scherphof 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodruff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Woodruff 2007</LINK>), universities (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>) or summer camps (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK>). Educational settings have the advantage of easier recruitment and minimization of contamination. Nine studies recruited wholly or partially from the healthcare environment (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redding-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherbot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sherbot 2005</LINK>) and one further study via a website aimed at smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2014</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muramoto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2006</LINK>) recruited directly from the community. Where a school or college was the base, trials were often cluster-randomized, with the intervention delivered to all students in one school, with matched schools used for control (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodruff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Woodruff 2007</LINK>), although there were also examples of individually randomized trials in educational settings (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joffe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joffe 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rate of recruitment was commented on by several trialists. Where schools were recruited and matched or randomized, and attendance in the programme was not compulsory, typically fewer than half of the students who smoked showed interest in enrolling (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1978</LINK>; NoT studies; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK>). Some trials that recruited from healthcare settings reported recruitment rates higher than 50% of eligible participants (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2007</LINK>), substantially so in the case of one trial based in a mental-health setting (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK>). Recent trials of text messaging interventions have achieved participation rates of above 70% when recruitment took place in a school-based, cluster-randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>) or when the intervention was supplemented with peer support (<LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>), but lower recruitment rates when participants were recruited online (<LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>For many studies with lower recruitment rates, parental permission was a requirement. Inducements to enrol or remain in the study (money, gift cards or class credits) were also a feature of many trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joffe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joffe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NoT-MD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">NoT MD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redding-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherphof-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Scherphof 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherbot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sherbot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodruff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Woodruff 2007</LINK>). In some trials an element of compulsion was present, either with attendance as a consequence of a smoking policy violation (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>) or as a controlled regimen in a hospital setting (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK>). Intention to quit smoking was a pre-requisite of many trials but was not required for inclusion in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition of smoking</HEADING>
<P>One of the crucial issues for smoking cessation research for young people is how smoking is defined, and how cessation is defined and verified. The cessation issues are described in the subsection following, in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section and in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was variation among the included studies concerning the definition of smoking status, with most relying on self-reported smoking status at recruitment (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). In general, at least one cigarette per week (cpw) was used as a definition of being a smoker. Studies used many different definitions (e.g. one cigarette per day at recruitment, or ten cigarettes in the previous 30 days) and it is likely that some studies with less stringent inclusion criteria recruited some participants who smoked less frequently than one cpw at the time of recruitment. Where there was doubt, we assured compatibility with our criteria through discussion with study authors, where possible. <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> differentiated between smokers and 'experimenters', but no studies explicitly took account of the episodic nature of adolescent smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Corby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corby 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2003</LINK>). Many studies estimated nicotine dependence using some form of scale, most commonly the modified Fagerström Questionnaire (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>), alongside self-reported measures. Other studies used cotinine or exhaled carbon monoxide in the baseline smoking status assessment or as part of the inclusion criteria (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Muramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muramoto 2007</LINK>; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for details).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measurement of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome was individual-level smoking cessation. Just as a wide variety of definitions of smoking was used, so there were several definitions of cessation.</P>
<P>The gold standard outcome of continuous abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>) was used by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Milena-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Milena 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2009</LINK>). Other continuous measures included "prolonged abstinence", defined as continuous abstinence following an initial two-week grace period (<LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK>), and "sustained cessation", defined as two sequential reports of seven-day point prevalence abstinence at four months and eight months from the start of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2004</LINK>). One study used a self-reported measure based solely on the participant's categorization in the Stages of Change model (<LINK REF="STD-Redding-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Point prevalence measures were in the majority and these ranged from cessation for one day (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2008</LINK>) to 30-day cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalum-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dalum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joffe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joffe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NoT-MD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">NoT MD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_4-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-4 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherphof-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Scherphof 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2014</LINK>).

Analysis 1 displays results of studies comparing behavioural interventions with control, grouped by type of behavioural intervention. Analysis 2 also displays results of studies comparing behavioural interventions with control, but interventions are grouped by the theoretical basis of the intervention. Analysis 3 contains studies of pharmacological interventions. Analysis 4 contains the results from the Project EX trials. Four studies do not appear in these analyses. For one, we were unable to establish the denominator and the study report was published before follow-up was complete (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>). One study did not report sufficient data for numerical extraction (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK>). Two studies used a combination of counselling and pharmacological interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK>) and so did not did not fit into the categorization adopted for this review; one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK>) also did not provide sufficient data with which a summary statistic could be calculated.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behavioural interventions versus control, grouped by delivery mode</HEADING>
<P>Among studies that primarily offered individual counselling as the intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), the pooled risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.39, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 1%, seven studies, n = 2088). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>, which showed a small, negative (albeit not statistically significant) effect of the intervention on 30-day point prevalence abstinence at six months. This study however claimed a beneficial effect of the intervention on quit attempts and an increased rate of cessation among heavier baseline smokers. <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Milena-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Milena 2012</LINK> also demonstrated notably higher quit rates in both intervention and control groups than the much larger study of <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2011</LINK> (crude intervention group quit rate 20% for <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>, 30% for <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_rez_x002d_Milena-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pérez-Milena 2012</LINK>, 5% for <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies that used group counselling (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) demonstrated a larger intervention effect (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, nine studies, n = 1910). None of the nine contributing studies showed a statistically significant effect of the intervention individually, although in eight of these studies the point estimate of the RR was above one and many had small sample sizes (less than 100 participants per group). Two studies yielded very large point estimates because of very low (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1978</LINK>) or zero (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015a</LINK>) quit rates in the control group.</P>
<P>Among interventions that used information or communication technology (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), there were no statistically significant intervention effects for either purely computer-based interventions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.24, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, three studies, n = 340) or messaging interventions (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.56, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, three studies, n = 2985). When we pooled results from the three studies that used a combination of a computer-based intervention and face-to-face counselling, statistical heterogeneity was high (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%), with substantially different results between the two largest trials, and hence we have not presented pooled results for this comparison. <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK> (based on the results after one year of follow-up reported in <LINK REF="REF-Aveyard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aveyard 1999</LINK>) found no effect (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.33, n = 1089), whereas <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> found a strong, positive intervention effect (RR 1.79, 1.19 to 2.71, n = 448). The latter's authors attribute the difference to greater provision of adjunct counselling alongside the computer-based materials, as in <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK> the face-to-face component of the intervention was delivered to participants in a group in a school classroom setting. The effect sizes at one year and two years for <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> were very similar, even though the percentage of participants in the intervention group achieving cessation dropped from 28% to 24% between these two time points, while two-year follow-up results provided by <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK> continued to show a non-statistically significant intervention effect. The third study in this subgroup found no intervention effect, but this was based on a small subgroup of the total sample who were smokers at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Redding-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diverse category of trials whose interventions included multiple delivery methods (all included self-help materials alongside other more intensive delivery modes) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) showed a pooled RR of 1.26 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, eight studies, n = 2755). In this analysis there were also two small trials with a very high RR estimate because of a low cessation rate in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Gungormus-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gungormus 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2014</LINK>); these studies were rated as having high risk of bias but because of their size were relatively uninfluential on the pooled estimate. The three largest trials in this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dalum-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dalum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2009</LINK>) all showed positive, non-statistically significant findings, with RR estimates ranging between 1.10 and 1.29. All three of these trials used a multifactorial intervention that included elements of counselling alongside self-help materials, with some level of tailoring to individual requirements.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behavioural interventions versus control, grouped by theoretical basis</HEADING>
<P>The theoretical basis of behavioural interventions was not always easy to classify, as the studies did not always provide detailed information and some studies used interventions that combined multiple theoretical approaches.</P>
<P>In the three subgroups that could be defined by the theoretical basis of the intervention, corresponding to Stage of Change models (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), motivational interviewing (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) and social cognitive theory (SCT) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) respectively, all showed small effect sizes (stage of change versus control RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.31, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, six studies, n = 3282; motivational interviewing versus control RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, ten studies, n = 1752; SCT versus control RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.51, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, six studies, n = 3667).</P>
<P>In the group of studies that were classified as using a complex theoretical model (e.g. drawing on multiple theories) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>), there was evidence of a positive intervention effect (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 14%, nine studies, n = 2827). One study was quite influential on the pooled estimate, and was the only one of the contributing trials that reported a statistically significant intervention effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>). Of the two studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis but also fell into this category, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK> in summer recreation camps claimed a higher smoking cessation rate for smoking in the intervention group (in the context of a near-zero cessation rate among participants in the control group) and <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>, using a combination of CBT and motivational techniques delivered over four sessions with telephone follow-up, did not detect any effect on cessation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pharmacological interventions</HEADING>
<P>This review contains four studies that used pharmacological interventions. Effect sizes are displayed in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>. All studies were relatively small and abstinence rates were low, and so confidence intervals are wide. The only studies that used directly comparable interventions were two trials that used nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (<LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherphof-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Scherphof 2014</LINK>). These yielded a pooled RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.48 to 2.58, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 20%, n = 385). Pooled results from nicotine patch yielded an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.56, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57%, n = 319). <LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK> also used a nicotine gum treatment arm: the RR of 1.74 (95% CI 0.21 to 14.60, n = 66) for gum versus placebo at six months had a very wide confidence interval. <LINK REF="STD-Muramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muramoto 2007</LINK> did not detect evidence for a benefit of standard dose bupropion (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.02, n = 207), and <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK> also failed to detect an effect for bupropion used as an adjunct to NRT patches versus patches alone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.69, n = 211). Given the small number of individuals in both the intervention or control groups who achieved smoking cessation at any point during follow-up, these studies appear to be severely underpowered.</P>
<P>Two trials, not included in forest plots, used interventions that combined a pharmacological and a behavioural component. Both the intervention and the control group participants of <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK> received 10 weeks of group-based CBT and skills training, followed by nine weeks of therapy using a nicotine patch; the intervention group additionally received nine additional subsequent group sessions ("extended treatment"). The trial resulted in a large increase in smoking cessation in the intervention group compared to control (seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 weeks: 15/72 versus 5/71, RR 2.96, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.71, n = 143 (analysis not shown)). <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2015</LINK> used a complex intervention that consisted of several components, including a Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) (TTM)-based computer intervention, six sessions of CBT and the option of 12 weeks using a nicotine patch for heavier smokers. This study reported 15% seven-day point prevalence abstinence after 12 months for all trial participants, but no evidence of a difference between the study arms (full results data were not available).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Project EX interventions</HEADING>
<P>Five eligible trials used a version of Project EX, originally developed as a clinic-based smoking cessation programme (<LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2004</LINK>): an initial evaluation in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>), and four more recent studies in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_4-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-4 2007</LINK>), Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015b</LINK>) and Russia (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK>). The first of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>) contained a third arm in which the Project EX intervention was enhanced with a 'school-as-community' component. This was combined with the standard Project EX arm for the purpose of data analysis and the enhanced intervention has not been used in subsequent trials. Among the four studies with data suitable for pooling, the estimated effect RR was 1.48 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.10, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, four studies, n = 1215, <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Russia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Russia 2013</LINK> also stated a beneficial effect on smoking cessation, but did not provide sufficient data to be included in numerical analysis. This result should be taken in the context that the two Spanish studies, which were conducted in similar school settings, were judged at particularly high risk of bias, with concerns relating to both institutional and participant-level dropout. Additionally, there was a marked variation in absolute quit rates between the Project EX trials, with reported six-month quit rates in control group participants ranging from zero (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX-Spain-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX Spain 2015a</LINK>) to 25% of baseline smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_4-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-4 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Varying the assumed ICC had relatively little effect on the magnitude of pooled RRs as many studies were either individually randomized or had already allowed for clustering in their published analyses, and estimates from other studies already tended to have wide confidence intervals. In the different sensitivity analysis scenarios, point estimates for the pooled RR ranged from 1.34 to 1.38 for <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, from 1.25 to 1.27 for <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, from 1.15 to 1.16 for <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>, from 1.39 to 1.43 in <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK> and from 1.46 to 1.53 in <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>None of the psychosocial trials reported whether any adverse events had occurred. In the trial of nicotine patch or gum versus placebo of <LINK REF="STD-Moolchan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moolchan 2005</LINK>, one or both of the active medications were associated with an increase compared to placebo in five symptom categories - sore throat, hiccups, erythema, pruritus and shoulder/arm pain. <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2013</LINK> reported the occurrence of 73 unspecified adverse events during the open-label nicotine patch treatment phase, but that none of these was "medically serious". <LINK REF="STD-Scherphof-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Scherphof 2014</LINK> stated that participants using the nicotine patch reported more episodes of headache, cough, abnormal dreams, muscle pain, and "patch-related adverse events" than those in the control group, but that successful quitters in the nicotine patch group reported a lower level of insomnia than those in the control group, which the authors attribute to withdrawal effects. The authors state these self-reported side effects to be generally mild.</P>
<P>In the trial of bupropion as an adjunct to nicotine patch (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>), although young people reported a total of 47 self-rated "severe" complaints, with nausea the most common, none of these was judged to be severe by the lead study physician. In the trial of bupropion alone (<LINK REF="STD-Muramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muramoto 2007</LINK>), a large number of participants in all study groups, including the control group, reported adverse effects (for example, around half of all participants reported headache; cough, throat symptoms, sleep disturbance and nausea were also each reported by more than 10% of participants). Eight subjects discontinued bupropion treatment because of different adverse events, and two further serious adverse events resulting in hospitalization occurred among participants in the bupropion group: one participant was admitted for anticholinergic crisis after ingesting <I>Datura innoxia </I>and one participant intentionally overdosed on study medication and other substances<I>.</I>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>This is an update of a review first published in 2006. The most recent (2017) update includes 19 additional studies. However, our certainty in the findings remains low or very low for all comparisons. For behavioural therapies (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), when we grouped interventions by delivery mode, no interventions showed effects apart from group counselling, but certainty here is limited by inconsistency and risk of bias, and imprecision is an additional issue for the other interventions tested. When we grouped studies by theoretical basis, studies employing complex theoretical models showed the most promise, but again these studies were clinically heterogeneous. There is very limited evidence on pharmacotherapies in this population, with two small studies of nicotine replacement therapy and two small studies of bupropion failing to demonstrate an effect (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Evidence here is again limited by issues with imprecision and risk of bias. Pooled results from the four studies evaluating Project EX showed a pooled result whose confidence intervals only narrowly exceeded 1. As with previous versions of this review, this update demonstrates that more research is still needed in this field. Our specific recommendations for future research are detailed below (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness, applicability and quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>As detailed in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> the quality of the evidence in this review is limited by issues relating to individual study quality (risk of bias), imprecision due to a small number of included studies and some studies appearing underpowered, and inconsistency due to clinical heterogeneity between studies. This hampers our ability to draw any firm conclusions about the interventions evaluated in this review. Some further issues with the data are discussed in more detail below.</P>
<P>The first of these is that most of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries. As previously explained (see <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>), adolescent smoking rates are, for the most part, declining in high-income countries. However, they remain high, and in some cases continue to rise, in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, the majority of the evidence from this review has not been generated in the setting where the interventions are most needed. This is not to say that the interventions tested in high-income countries are not relevant to LMICs, nor that high income-countries are not also in need of effective stop-smoking programmes for adolescents, but LMICs may face particular challenges with implementation that have yet to be adequately explored by the research in this field.</P>
<P>With regards to applicability, it should be noted that where recruitment was by inclusion from self-reports it is likely that those volunteering, and in some trials obtaining parental consent, could be perceived as a subset of all smokers - those who were both willing to quit and willing to participate in a research study. Some study authors comment on this aspect of recruitment (<LINK REF="REF-Kealey-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kealey 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further weakness in the evidence base springs from the definitions of quitting used in different studies. These vary from self-reported quitting for longer than one day through to seven-day or 30-day point prevalence abstinence at the point of ascertainment, to longer or continuous periods (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). With respect to the shorter point prevalence abstinences, a negative result is useful in demonstrating evidence of a lack of effect where the study size is adequate but care should be taken with the shorter quit lengths such as 24 hours. The irregularity and instability of the smoking habit in its early stages (for example, weekend smoking is commonly reported) and the low number of cigarettes smoked at baseline by some participants, calls into question the prognostic value of short-term point prevalence abstinence measurements of less than 30 days. Several trials recognize this pattern of smoking and use a 30-day measure of abstinence but continuous abstinence remains the recommended outcome (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). It is tempting to conclude that encouraging an increased number of what are effectively short-lived (e.g. seven-day) quit attempts allows young people to 'practice' quitting, and therefore may help to achieve prolonged cessation in the long run. Prolonged quit attempts might also have a health benefit on their own, or interrupt the progression to more regular or heavy smoking. However, we have no data for young people against which we can test these assumptions.</P>
<P>In addition, several studies clearly demonstrate the importance of biochemical verification (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Colby 2005</LINK>) as substantial numbers of participants have given false information regarding quit attempts. This raises possible doubts about the validity of those studies that showed positive results but did not use verification, for example, <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_1-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-1 2001</LINK>, verification was incomplete and a weighting factor was added to results. For <LINK REF="STD-NoT-WV-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NoT WV 2011</LINK>, verification was added to the intervention but only done at three months. There is a continued need for further studies where smoking status has been verified, but the experience of some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2008</LINK>) underlines the challenges that face researchers in this area. Muramoto warns that exhaled CO has a short half-life and may be an insensitive measure given the episodic nature of teen smoking. She reports cotinine confirmed rates 50% to 65% lower than CO rates (<LINK REF="STD-Muramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muramoto 2007</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>For the purpose of this review, we have taken a clinical focus on young smokers. In public health terms, the line between young smokers, experimenters and 'potential' smokers is blurred. Some interventions are therefore aimed at the population level, attempting to combine prevention and cessation. Individual clinicians, however, face a different problem: what advice should they give and what works for the young person who has started smoking and expresses a wish to stop? For this review, therefore, we drew what might otherwise be seen as an arbitrary line and developed a protocol that would include those prevention studies that had a cessation intervention component and discrete results for smokers.</P>
<P>Ideally, we would wish to know outcomes in terms of true smoking cessation, that is, quitting smoking and never smoking again, although an absolute measure of cessation in these terms is in practice impossible, as it would require life-long follow-up of participants. It is necessary therefore to consider just how well what are effectively proxy measures correspond to the desired outcome. Clearly, longer periods of follow-up would be of greater value. We therefore limited our review to studies with six months' follow-up, as recommended elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Mermelstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermelstein 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). There is clear evidence in some of the included studies that performed repeated measures, of a waning effect over this period (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK>). Early relapse is an obvious danger, especially for young people who have been shown to make many quit attempts (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2009</LINK>). In order to standardize comparisons, we took the six-month period as beginning from baseline measurement. It should be noted however, that studies may not set a quit date until some weeks into the programme (e.g. Project EX) and this may be a source of bias when comparing outcomes.</P>
<P>For our results, we used an intention-to-treat analysis, that is, all those randomized were included in their original groups, whether or not they received the full intervention. We counted all those with missing data as continuing smokers. We requested information from authors where necessary to facilitate these calculations. Although this is standard practice in adult cessation studies, the reasons for young people dropping out from follow-up are diverse, and by no means always related to risk of continued smoking. We accept, therefore, that this assumption leads to a conservative analysis, and that it may bias our results towards the null.</P>
<P>Many studies in this area are cluster-randomized. Where authors had not allowed for clustering effects in their statistical analysis, we imputed a plausible value of the ICC, and varied this value in a sensitivity analysis. This did not have large influence on estimates of the pooled effect sizes, and the uncertainty due to this analysis appears small compared to the uncertainty in the effect estimate itself, as reflected in generally wide confidence intervals that do not rule out the possibility of clinically important effects.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>The results of this review are for the most part consistent with other reviews of smoking cessation interventions in young people, though other reviews are very different from ours (<LINK REF="REF-Sussman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gervais-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gervais 2007</LINK>). Some of these reviews had a much wider focus and included non-experimental studies. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 2006</LINK> (also discussed by <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2012</LINK>) found some evidence of a modest improvement in quit rate both overall and stratified by the theoretical basis of the intervention but included many non-randomized studies and did not restrict by the length of follow-up. Our review update has aimed instead to evaluate the experimental evidence for effectiveness. Our results are also consistent with <LINK REF="REF-Riemsma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riemsma 2003</LINK>, whose review found results similar to <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2001</LINK>. A recent review of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in adolescents, which included a broader range of study types than our review, also did not detect evidence of an effect (<LINK REF="REF-King-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is, however, one review of randomized controlled trials of which we are aware that concluded that behavioural interventions for smoking cessation in adolescents were effective (<LINK REF="STD-Peirson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Peirson 2016</LINK>). This was an update of a 2013 review (<LINK REF="REF-Patnode-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patnode 2013</LINK>) focusing on primary-care relevant interventions. Though the 2013 review did not find any evidence of effectiveness, in the 2016 review, inclusion criteria were amended to include only studies with control groups that received no content specifically designed or intended to prevent or treat tobacco smoking. Three studies are therefore included in <LINK REF="STD-Peirson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Peirson 2016</LINK>'s meta-analysis of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation; of these, one was excluded from our review as it did not meet our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2008</LINK>). The study driving the observed effect in <LINK REF="STD-Peirson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Peirson 2016</LINK> is <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>. In our review, <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> is classed as an intervention using both computer-based and face-to-face counselling interventions; when pooled, the result for this comparison was not statistically significant but we did not present pooled results due to substantial statistical heterogeneity (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). In our analysis by theoretical basis, <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> is pooled with other interventions using a complex theoretical model (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>); here an effect was detected. However, this group of interventions was clinically heterogeneous and we judged <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK> to be at high risk of bias as it did not use biochemical verification of smoking status. As this study was the most influential on the effect estimate in this subgroup, having a large sample size, we believe these concerns warrant caution when interpreting results.</P>
<P>Our results contrast with those of systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of similar interventions in adult populations. For some of the intervention methods considered there is not enough evidence from trials of young people to make a definitive comparison with results from trials in adults. However, the pooled effect size estimates for individual and group therapies are lower than those in previous Cochrane Reviews for adults. For individual counselling in young people, the RR estimate of 1.07, with an upper 95% CI limit of 1.39, compares to an estimate of 1.57, with lower 95% CI limit of 1.40 in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2017</LINK>). For group counselling versus control, the effect size estimate for young people (1.35) is also lower than the effect sizes seen for some group-based interventions in adults (RR 1.88 when compared to self-help interventions, <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2017</LINK>). The estimated RR for mobile phone-based interventions is much lower in our review than in the corresponding review in adults (1.67, <LINK REF="REF-Whittaker-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittaker 2016</LINK>). The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in young people is particularly striking. The existing evidence base gives us no reason to believe that the neuropharmacological efficacy, effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation should be different for adolescents than for any other group of smokers, but the context and meaning of smoking in adolescence is very different from that for adult smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Amos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amos 2006</LINK>). While there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of NRT (from 150 trials, <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>) and bupropion (from 65 trials, <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2014</LINK>) for cessation, our review contains just four relatively small studies that used either of these treatments, and hence their effectiveness in young people remains uncertain. Taken together, these comparisons demonstrate that adult interventions whose effectiveness is well established cannot be assumed to be equally successful in younger age groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future directions</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-seven of the 41 included studies have been published within the last ten years, with 19 new studies contributing to this update, suggesting an increase in both activity and in some instances in quality. However, this update has not resulted in stronger conclusions regarding the effectiveness of interventions in this area. Due to continuing limitations in the evidence base, we are unable to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. We are aware that there is a growing interest in this topic and we intend to continue regular updates of this review. Over the period that we have been extracting data, teenage prevalence figures have shown some improvement in those countries using global public health campaigns (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2012</LINK>), such as bans on smoking in public places (<LINK REF="REF-Frazer-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frazer 2016</LINK>), suggesting global measures may have had an impact on smoking initiation. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that a substantial segment of young people still smoke and a high proportion of quit attempts fail (<LINK REF="REF-Bancej-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancej 2007</LINK>). In some lower and middle income countries, the prevalence of smoking in young people is rising (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 2015</LINK>), and in high income countries, the burden disproportionately falls on people with mental health conditions and on those of lower socioeconomic status. Further research into effective ways to help young people stop smoking continues to be needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-09 14:51:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe">
<P>Research is developing and increasingly studies are measuring verified, sustained quitting. This trend is to be encouraged for all new trials for teen smoking. However, our confidence for all findings in this review is limited by issues with imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency. More studies are urgently needed evaluating both pharmacological and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation in young people. Studies should minimize risk of bias as much as possible and be adequately powered for cessation. The evidence is developing for complex psychosocial interventions but needs to be replicated and tested in different settings. The theoretical basis of all interventions should be explicit, and reporting using CONSORT standards (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>) should be the norm (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2005</LINK>). Trials of brief interventions or self-help materials would be useful, particularly as these are often used as control conditions for more complex interventions. In addition, the majority of studies in this review were conducted in high-income countries, despite adolescent smoking rates being substantially higher in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, further studies conducted in LMICs would be particularly useful.</P>
<P>Likely losses to follow-up for this age group must also be considered in the research design and the assumption that losses to follow-up are non-quitters (whilst representing the current 'gold standard') needs testing. Every effort should be made to keep the latter as small as possible, so that intention-to-treat analysis with missing participants treated as continuing smokers can be carried out without excessive bias towards the null. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 2009</LINK> demonstrate good practice in this respect. Subsidiary analysis of data with other imputed data is acceptable but should not represent the main result.</P>
<P>Biochemical verification remains the gold standard (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>) and there is the potential for substantial misclassification of smoking status in adolescents if relying on self-report alone (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 2008</LINK>). If it is used, note should be made on the limitations of exhaled CO, given the episodic nature of smoking in this population. However, although it is recognized that self-reports in this cohort are not necessarily reliable, voluntary use of verification can affect recruitment and retention, especially if parental consent is required before it is used in adolescents, and a pragmatic decision needs to be taken in study design that balances these factors (<LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review did not find any eligible studies that used electronic cigarettes as an intervention for tobacco smoking cessation in adolescents. A recent systematic review of electronic cessation interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hartmann_x002d_Boyce-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann-Boyce 2016</LINK>) also found no randomized trials in this age group, and only a single, non-randomized, study that investigated their use in a young adult population, aged 18 to 24 years (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2014</LINK>). Given the sharply increasing popularity of electronic cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Farsalinos-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farsalinos 2016</LINK>), it appears reasonable to expect future evaluations in relation to tobacco smoking cessation in young people as the scope of the research literature in this area continues to grow.</P>
<P>Few of our studies complied with the Russell Standard (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). Six months' follow-up should be a minimum requirement, and research should use outcomes based on sustained, continuous quitting in line with the Russell Standard. As a complementary measure, long-term prospective studies of the natural smoking history of those making quit attempts in adolescence are needed. Finally, as the field matures, direct comparisons of effective treatments should become possible and should support full economic analyses.</P>

<P>Upon re-evaluation for the update in 2017 we decided to modify the inclusion criteria such that non-randomized controlled trials are no longer included in this review. This is because of the increased risk of bias they introduce, which can decrease the certainty of our findings. We re-assessed previously included studies to ensure consistency, and excluded six studies because they were non-randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Myers 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NoT-AL-2008" TYPE="STUDY">NoT AL 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NoT-FL-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NoT FL 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NoT-NC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">NoT NC 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NoT-WV-2004" TYPE="STUDY">NoT WV 2004</LINK>). Another reassignment of studies occurred with our evaluation of ages of participants. We decided to include studies in which more than 50% of the participants were under 20 years so long as there was evidence that the intervention was tailored towards young people. In following this, three studies that had been excluded in previous editions have been included in this edition (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 2000</LINK>), and a further study has been included because of the publication of a corrigendum to the original trial paper (<LINK REF="STD-Project-EX_x002d_4-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Project EX-4 2007</LINK>). In addition, in the 2017 update we no longer list participation, retention or enrolment as outcomes, focusing solely on smoking cessation and adverse events, in line with other Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group reviews. We have moved the outcome, Adverse events to be listed as a primary outcome. We have added 'Summary of findings' tables in line with Cochrane guidance.</P>

An exploratory randomized controlled trial of a novel high-school-based smoking cessation intervention for adolescent smokers using abstinence-contingent incentives and cognitive behavioral therapy Drug and Alcohol Dependence 2013 132( 1-2) 346-51 BACKGROUND: There are few effective smoking cessation interventions for adolescent smokers. We developed a novel intervention to motivate tobacco use behavior change by (1) enhancing desire to quit through the use of abstinence-contingent incentives (CM), (2) increasing cessation skills through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (3) removing cessation barriers through delivery within high schools. // METHODS: An exploratory four-week, randomized controlled trial was conducted in Connecticut high schools to dismantle the independent and combined effects of CM and CBT; smokers received CM alone, CBT alone, or CM+CBT. Participants included 82 adolescent smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. The primary outcome was seven-day end-of-treatment (EOT) point prevalence (PP) abstinence, determined using self-reports confirmed using urine cotinine levels. Secondary outcomes included one-day EOT PP abstinence and cigarette use during treatment and follow up. // RESULTS: Among participants who initiated treatment (n=72), group differences in seven-day EOT-PP abstinence were observed (chi(2)=10.48, p0.01) with higher abstinence in the CM+CBT (36.7%) and CM (36.3%) conditions when compared with CBT (0%). One-day EOT-PP abstinence evidenced similar effects (chi(2)=10.39, p0.01; CM+CBT: 43%, CM: 43%, CBT: 4.3%). Survival analyses indicated differences in time to first cigarette during treatment (chi(2)=8.73, p=0.003; CBT: Day 3, CM: Day 9, CM+CBT: Day 20). At one- and three-month follow ups, while no differences were observed, the CM alone group had the slowest increase in cigarette use. // CONCLUSIONS: High-school, incentive-based smoking cessation interventions produce high rates of short-term abstinence among adolescent smokers; adding cognitive behavioral therapy does not appear to further enhance outcomes;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-11-09 15:43:12 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

An exploratory randomized controlled trial of a novel high-school-based smoking cessation intervention for adolescent smokers using abstinence-contingent incentives and cognitive behavioral therapy Drug and Alcohol Dependence 2013 132( 1-2) 346-51 BACKGROUND: There are few effective smoking cessation interventions for adolescent smokers. We developed a novel intervention to motivate tobacco use behavior change by (1) enhancing desire to quit through the use of abstinence-contingent incentives (CM), (2) increasing cessation skills through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (3) removing cessation barriers through delivery within high schools. // METHODS: An exploratory four-week, randomized controlled trial was conducted in Connecticut high schools to dismantle the independent and combined effects of CM and CBT; smokers received CM alone, CBT alone, or CM+CBT. Participants included 82 adolescent smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. The primary outcome was seven-day end-of-treatment (EOT) point prevalence (PP) abstinence, determined using self-reports confirmed using urine cotinine levels. Secondary outcomes included one-day EOT PP abstinence and cigarette use during treatment and follow up. // RESULTS: Among participants who initiated treatment (n=72), group differences in seven-day EOT-PP abstinence were observed (chi(2)=10.48, p0.01) with higher abstinence in the CM+CBT (36.7%) and CM (36.3%) conditions when compared with CBT (0%). One-day EOT-PP abstinence evidenced similar effects (chi(2)=10.39, p0.01; CM+CBT: 43%, CM: 43%, CBT: 4.3%). Survival analyses indicated differences in time to first cigarette during treatment (chi(2)=8.73, p=0.003; CBT: Day 3, CM: Day 9, CM+CBT: Day 20). At one- and three-month follow ups, while no differences were observed, the CM alone group had the slowest increase in cigarette use. // CONCLUSIONS: High-school, incentive-based smoking cessation interventions produce high rates of short-term abstinence among adolescent smokers; adding cognitive behavioral therapy does not appear to further enhance outcomes;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-11-09 15:43:28 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

The underutilization of typical cessation programs suggests the need for novel and more engaging approaches for reaching college smokers. The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of a dissonance-enhancing, Web-based experiential intervention for increasing smoking cessation motivation and behavior. // METHOD: We used a 4-arm, randomized design to examine the efficacy of a Web-based, experiential smoking intervention (Web-Smoke). The control conditions included a didactic smoking intervention (Didactic), a group-based experiential intervention (Group), and a Web-based nutrition experiential intervention (Web-Nutrition). We recruited 341 college smokers. Primary outcomes were motivation to quit, assessed immediately postintervention, and smoking abstinence at 1 and 6 months following the intervention. // RESULTS: As hypothesized, the Web-Smoke intervention was more effective than control groups in increasing motivation to quit. At 6-month follow-up, the Web-Smoke intervention produced higher rates of smoking cessation than the Web-Nutrition control intervention. Daily smoking moderated intervention outcomes. Among daily smokers, the Web-Smoke intervention produced greater abstinence rates than both the Web-Nutrition and Didactic control conditions. // CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate the efficacy of a theory-based intervention delivered over the Internet for increasing motivation to quit and smoking abstinence among college smokers. The intervention has potential for translation and implementation as a secondary prevention strategy for college-aged smoker;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-06-09 11:24:27 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Although a baseline comparison between int and cont group found no differences overall this was not investigated specifically for the smokers and so we cannot be sure that the groups of partcipants we are interested in were sufficiently matched.; William Halliwell (2016-07-26 23:16:04)(Select): although cessation outcomes were reported, intervention was targeted towards prevention. Additionally, 40% of participants were not smokers.; Lindsay F (2016-07-20 23:19:16)(Screen): probably not rct; Lindsay F (2016-07-20 23:18:35)(Screen): BACKGROUND: Adolescents have smoked less in recent years, but 11.7% of 12-to-17-year-olds were still smokers in 2011. The prevalence of smoking has also remained high among 18-to-25-year-olds (36.8%). An intervention program called &amp;quot;Students in the Hospital&amp;quot; was developed in which the health aspects of smoking and its individual and societal consequences were presented in an interactive informational event. In this study, we determine the efficacy of the program. // METHODS: From September 2007 to July 2008, we performed an anonymous survey by questionnaire, with a quasi-experimental control-group design, two weeks before (t(1)) and six months after (t(2)) the intervention in a group of 760 participating school students in Berlin. // RESULTS: 40.8% of the participants were smokers, among whom 79% stated that they smoked water pipe. Significantly fewer students in the intervention group than in the control group began smoking in the six months after the intervention (p&amp;lt;0.001). The chance of remaining a non-smoker was four times as high in the intervention group (OR, 4.14; CI, 1.66-10.36). Girls benefited from the intervention more than boys (OR 2.56, CI 1.06-6.19). 16.1% of smokers in the intervention group and 17.6% in the control group gave up smoking (p&amp;gt;0.05). // CONCLUSION: A clear primary preventive effect of the program was demonstrated, although it apparently did not induce persons who were already smokers to quit.;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-06-09 11:25:19 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Thomas R Fanshawe" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

(3) Control: standard care<BR/>1. Project Ex was 8 sessions or 'clinics' over a 6-week period delivered to groups and developed in trials. 4 sessions were preparation for quitting over 2 weeks, and next 4 were weekly during the first month post-quit<BR/>Theoretical basis of intervention: complex theoretical constructs including MI etc, and including games for groups, education and anger management, yoga, weight control, meditation, assertiveness training, role play and relapse prevention<BR/>2. SAC intervention: modelled on Toward No Drug Abuse programme.
