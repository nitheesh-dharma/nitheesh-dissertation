<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-17 12:25:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) is the single largest cause of deaths and ill health for newborn babies and a major cause of complications for pregnant women. Tocolytic agents include a wide range of drugs that can slow or stop labour contractions so as to prolong pregnancy and potentially improve the health outcomes for the baby. Using a combination of two or more tocolytic drugs may improve the length of time the pregnancy is prolonged over using a single tocolytic drug or no intervention, without adversely affecting the mother or baby or worsening drug side effects.</P>
<P>This review examined the effects of any combination of tocolytic drugs for the treatment of preterm labour, compared with any other treatment, no treatment or placebo. The results of the review are based on data from nine randomised controlled trials that examined seven different drug comparisons. </P>
<P>Three trials examined the betamimetic drug ritodrine plus magnesium compared with ritodrine alone. The trials reported on adverse side effects, with inconsistency between the trials as to which treatment gave fewer severe side effects. Other outcomes were either not reported or not clearly different between treatment groups.</P>
<P>One trial looked at ritodrine plus indomethacin versus ritodrine alone. There were no clear differences between groups for serious newborn ill health. Results for other outcomes were not clearly different. There were no clear differences between groups receiving ritodrine plus progesterone compared with ritodrine alone for most outcomes reported, although the time between giving the drugs and the birth was increased in the group receiving the combination of tocolytics. For other combinations of tocolytic agents, results did not demonstrate differences between groups. There were no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban).</P>
<P>Due to insufficient evidence, it is unclear if combination tocolytic regimens are more or less effective than using a single tocolytic drug, or if they have more adverse effects. Some widely used tocolytic drugs have not been examined in trials as part of combination regimens, so further research is needed.</P>

<P>Preterm birth represents the single largest cause of mortality and morbidity for newborns and a major cause of morbidity for pregnant women. Tocolytic agents include a wide range of drugs that can inhibit labour to prolong pregnancy. This may gain time to allow the fetus to mature further before being born, permit antenatal corticosteroid administration for lung maturation, and allow time for intra-uterine transfer to a hospital with neonatal intensive care facilities. However, some tocolytic drugs are associated with severe side effects. Combinations of tocolytic drugs may be more effective over single tocolytic agents or no intervention, without adversely affecting the mother or neonate. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-30 10:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. Two studies did not report any outcome data relevant to the review, so the results of the review are based on nine trials that contributed data. Primary outcomes were perinatal mortality, serious maternal or infant outcomes, adverse drug reactions, birth before 48 hours of trial entry, birth before 34 weeks' gestation and preterm neonates delivered without a full course of antenatal steroids completed 24 hours before birth. The quality of evidence in included trials was mixed; only three of the trials were placebo controlled.</P>
<P>The included trials examined seven different comparisons: intravenous (IV) ritodrine plus oral or IV magnesium (sulphate or gluconate) versus IV ritodrine alone (three trials, 231 women); IV ritodrine plus indomethacin suppositories versus IV ritodrine alone (one trial, 208 women); IV ritodrine plus vaginal progesterone versus IV ritodrine alone (one trial, 83 women); IV hexoprenaline sulphate plus IV magnesium hydrochloride versus IV hexoprenaline sulphate alone (one trial, 24 women); IV fenoterol plus oral naproxen versus IV fenoterol alone (one trial, 72 women); oral pentoxifylline plus IV magnesium sulphate plus IV fenoterol versus IV magnesium sulphate plus IV fenoterol (one trial, 125 women); and, IV terbutaline plus oral metoprolol versus IV terbutaline alone (one trial, 17 women). Few studies with small numbers of women were available for each comparison, hence very little data were pooled in meta-analysis. In all trials, not many of the primary outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>Three trials examined intravenous (IV) ritodrine plus IV or oral magnesium (sulphate or gluconate) compared with IV ritodrine alone. One study, with 41 women, reported more adverse drug reactions in the group receiving the combined tocolytics (risk ratio (RR) 7.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 54.80). Two trials reported discontinuation of therapy due to severe side effects (results were not combined due to high statistical heterogeneity, I² = 83%); one trial reported increased severe side effects in the group receiving IV ritodrine alone (RR 7.79, 95% CI 1.11 to 54.80, 41 women); in the other trial there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.97, 107 women). Other primary outcomes were not reported.</P>
<P>One trial assessed IV ritodrine plus indomethacin suppositories versus IV ritodrine alone. There were no significant differences between groups for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity. Results for other primary outcomes were not reported.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between groups receiving IV ritodrine plus vaginal progesterone compared with IV ritodrine alone for most outcomes reported, although the latency period (time from recruitment to delivery) was increased in the group receiving the combination of tocolytics.</P>
<P>For other combinations of tocolytic agents, primary outcomes were rarely reported and for secondary outcomes results did not demonstrate differences between groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 13:51:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unclear whether a combination of tocolytic drugs for preterm labour is more advantageous for women and/or newborns due to a lack of large, well-designed trials including the outcomes of interest. There are no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and/or oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban). Further trials are needed before specific conclusions on use of combination tocolytic therapy for preterm labour can be made. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:48:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Preterm birth is defined as birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>). It occurs in 11.1% of births globally, affecting an estimated 14.9 million babies every year (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Born-Too-Soon-Report-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Born Too Soon Report 2012</LINK>). In an analysis of 65 countries with reliable trend data on preterm births (1990 to 2010), 62 countries had stable or rising preterm birth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>). This has been attributed at least in part to rising rates of provider-initiated preterm birth and improved registration of extremely preterm births (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidoff 2006</LINK>). It is generally accepted that approximately 30% to 35% of preterm births are provider-initiated (by induction or caesarean section) for maternal and/or fetal indications, while 65% to 70% are spontaneous preterm births. Spontaneous preterm births includes those due to spontaneous preterm labour (40% to 45%) and those following preterm rupture of membranes (25% to 30%) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>). The precise cause of spontaneous preterm birth is often unknown, however several maternal factors are known to increase risk, including maternal age (adolescence and advanced age), maternal history of preterm birth, race, multiple pregnancy, short inter-pregnancy interval, infections, medical conditions, poor nutrition, lifestyle factors, psychological factors and genetic predisposition (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plunkett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plunkett 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm birth is the single largest cause of newborn mortality and is estimated to account for 29% of deaths in the first four weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2009</LINK>). Preterm newborns have higher rates of a range of neonatal morbidities, including respiratory (respiratory distress syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension) infectious (pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis), central nervous system (intraventricular haemorrhage, seizures) and metabolic (hypoglycaemia, jaundice and hyperbilirubinaemia) morbidities (<LINK REF="REF-Teune-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teune 2011</LINK>). Administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth has been shown to reduce the overall risk of neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, cerebroventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, the need for respiratory support or intensive care admissions and systemic infections in the first 48 hours of life (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the post-neonatal period, preterm infants are at continued risk of mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teune-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teune 2011</LINK>). In the longer term, they experience more illnesses, hospital admissions and educational and behavioral problems in childhood and early adulthood, (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ekeus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekeus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talge-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talge 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Baar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Baar 2009</LINK>) as well as higher rates of visual and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy and neuro-developmental and behavioural impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marlow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tocolytic therapy</HEADING>
<P>Tocolytic agents include a wide range of drugs that can slow or suppress uterine contractions. Tocolytics are considered advantageous in spontaneous preterm labour to (a) allow time for the fetus to mature, potentially avoiding the deleterious effects of prematurity; (b) allow time for antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) to be administered and have a clinical effect; and (c) allow time for intrauterine transfer to a higher-care centre, where neonatal intensive care facilities (or other services) are available (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ideal tocolytic agent should be effective, easy to administer, without significant maternal, fetal or neonatal side effects and permit time for antenatal corticosteroids to be administered and take effect (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>). A variety of tocolytic treatments have been used to inhibit uterine activity in women in spontaneous preterm labour, including beta-adrenergic receptor agonists (betamimetics), prostaglandin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, oxytocin receptor antagonists and magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>). However, there is considerable global variation in types, doses and regimens of tocolytic agents used to manage preterm labour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-01 17:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Uterine contractility is stimulated by increases in intracellular calcium ion concentrations in myometrial cells (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00e1_sp_x00e1_r-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gáspár 2013</LINK>). Intracellular calcium ion concentration is mediated by both voltage-gated calcium channels (for influx of calcium ions) and release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin and activate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in myometrial cells, leading to the phosphorylation of myosin light chains, initiating cross-bridging in contractile proteins and ultimately myometrial contraction (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00e1_sp_x00e1_r-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gáspár 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noble-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wray 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tocolytic agents inhibit uterine contractions through one of two pathways: Firstly, by affecting the contractile proteins in the myometrium (by blocking myosin phosphorylation through intracellular messengers). Betamimetics, nitric oxide donors, magnesium sulphate and calcium channel blockers affect contractile proteins. Betamimetics bind to beta-adrenergic receptors (increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, that inhibits myosin light chain kinase) preventing myosin phosphorylation. Nitric oxide donors produce a similar response through cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Conversely, magnesium sulphate and calcium channel blockers prevent intracellular calcium ion influx, also reducing myosin light chain kinase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Caritis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caritis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00e1_sp_x00e1_r-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gáspár 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The second pathway to preventing uterine contractility is through inhibiting synthesis or blocking the activity of myometrial stimulants (such as oxytocin and prostaglandins). By binding oxytocin receptors, oxytocin receptor antagonists (such as atosiban) prevent the oxytocin-mediated intracellular increase of inositol triphosphate, which normally increases intracellular calcium levels. Comparatively, cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes that catalyse prostaglandin production can be inhibited by general (COX) and selective (COX-2) enzyme inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Caritis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caritis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00e1_sp_x00e1_r-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gáspár 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>A combination of two or more tocolytic agents could be used to reduce uterine contractions by targeting different pathways in myometrial contraction, potentially improving the overall tocolytic effect (either additively or synergistically). Furthermore, combination therapy could permit reductions in dosage and/or frequency of individual tocolytic agents, potentially decreasing the rate of adverse effects while maintaining efficacy.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:49:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is evidence that some tocolytic agents decrease the number of women in preterm labour giving birth within 48 hours when compared with placebo. This can increase the likelihood of receiving a full course of antenatal corticosteroids, as well as increase the time for antenatal corticosteroids to have a clinical effect. However, due to the lack of systematic reviews examining maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality outcomes following combination tocolytic use, inhibiting preterm labour with more than one tocolytic agent is currently based on an incomplete understanding of risks and benefits. Furthermore, combinations of tocolytic agents have the potential for greater efficacy compared to single agents, as well as the potential for reduced dosage and/or frequency of administration, that could reduce the rate of adverse effects.</P>

We will adjust their sample sizes<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population.

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<P>Other outcomes were reported in this trial but analyses excluded women who either delivered within the first week of tocolysis, or withdrew from the trial, or changed the place of birth, or were intolerant to pentoxifylline. Of the 148 women randomised, data for pregnancy outcomes and serious infant morbidity were reported for only 96 of the original sample: 39% of the intervention group and 31% of the control group were not included in the analysis of these outcomes. In view of the high risk of bias for such outcomes, we have not, therefore, reported them in this review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-06-06 14:49:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>This systematic review included 11 studies with a total of 895 women. Data from nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 776 women reported outcome data relevant to this review. Overall, seven different combinations of tocolytic drugs were examined with only one or few small trials per comparison, so very few data were pooled in meta-analysis. While most of the included studies reported some measure of pregnancy prolongation, other outcomes were infrequently reported.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:54:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Three trials examined intravenous (IV) ritodrine plus oral or IV magnesium (sulphate or gluconate) compared with IV ritodrine alone. One study with 41 women reported more adverse drug reactions in the group receiving the combination of tocolytic drugs. Two trials reported discontinuation of therapy due to severe side effects, with one trial reporting increased side effects in the group receiving ritodrine alone, while in the other trial there was no clear difference between groups. Other outcomes were either not reported, or not statistically significant.</P>
<P>One trial compared IV ritodrine plus indomethacin suppositories versus IV ritodrine alone. There were no significant differences between groups for perinatal death serious neonatal morbidity. Results for other primary outcomes were not reported..</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between groups receiving IV ritodrine plus vaginal progesterone compared with IV ritodrine alone for most outcomes reported, although the latency period (time from randomisation to delivery) was increased in the group receiving the combination of tocolytics.</P>
<P>For other combinations of tocolytic agents, results did not demonstrate differences between groups.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-06 14:49:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Although the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate combinations of tocolytic agents compared with any other treatment on maternal and neonatal outcomes, we pre-specified outcomes chosen as the most representative clinical measures of effectiveness and complications. Unfortunately, some of these outcomes, particularly those to which the tocolytic treatment would be most relevant (e.g. 'birth before 48 hours of trial entry' to allow the administration of a complete course of corticosteroids)<I>, </I>were not assessed by any of the included studies.</P>
<P>The samples sizes of the individual trials were generally small. Moreover, the analysis of the largest study (which included only 208 women) was stratified into two groups because of a clinical source of heterogeneity (state of membranes). This and the poor quality of reporting in the majority of the included trials made conclusions difficult, and in most cases studies were underpowered to identify differences between groups. Antenatal corticosteroid use has an important effect on neonatal outcomes, however, its use was reported in only five of the included studies. Thus review findings must to be interpreted with considerable caution.</P>
<P>The most serious practical limitation of this systematic review is that none of the identified studies (included and excluded) evaluated two of the most commonly used tocolytic agents in high-resource settings, atosiban and nifedipine, as part of a combination or single tocolytic therapy. Many settings have abandoned the use of betamimetics for tocolysis due to their unfavourable side-effect profile in comparison with other agents (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014</LINK>). These results are therefore not clinically relevant in settings where betamimetics are no longer used.</P>
<P>A theoretically effective combination of tocolytics would include agents that act through different mechanisms, affecting contractile proteins in the myometrial cell and also blocking the action of myometrial stimulants. The latter action is only known to be performed by cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (indomethacin) and oxytocin antagonists (atosiban). Therefore, future trials of combinations of tocolytic agents should, where appropriate, include at least one of these two agents, as well as considering the need to evaluate calcium channel blockers in combination regimens.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:54:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>It was difficult to assess the methodological quality of most of the trials included in the review because of poor reporting. In most of the trials, methods for generating the randomisation sequence and concealing allocation at the point of randomisation were not clear or presented high risk of bias. Only four of the trials reported that blinding had been attempted. Lack of blinding may mean findings are at high risk of bias, as care would have been provided, and many of the outcomes assessed, by staff who would have been aware of what treatment a woman had received. In three trials, sample attrition was a serious source of bias because women were excluded from the study after randomisation or were lost to follow-up for reasons that may have related to treatment and this may have affected outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-08 13:32:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are aware that the review process itself is subject to bias, and we took steps to minimise bias. At least two review authors carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently; however, a different review team may not have made identical decisions.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-06-06 14:49:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>As with previous Cochrane reviews of tocolytic drugs, this review showed that betamimetics are the most commonly studied tocolytic agent. However, one review has demonstrated that (when used alone) calcium channel blockers are preferred to other single tocolytic drugs, particularly betamimetics (mostly ritodrine), due to comparable efficacy and fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2014</LINK>). Despite this, we found no trial that included calcium channel blockers in a combination tocolytic regimen. A review of the use of COX inhibitors alone (including indomethacin) for treating preterm labour could not recommend COX inhibitor use due to insufficient data (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>). However, in a small number of participants COX inhibitors reduced the proportion of women delivering preterm. The risks associated with magnesium sulphate alone in threatened preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>) should be carefully considered in tocolytic combination regimens.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:54:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 10:54:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>It remains unclear whether using a combination of tocolytic drugs for inhibiting preterm labour is more advantageous for women and/or newborns given the lack of studies. There is no direct trial evidence to demonstrate that combination tocolytic therapies are equivalent or superior (in either efficacy or side-effect profile) to commonly used single tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers or oxytocin receptor antagonists. Further trials are needed before specific conclusions on use of combination tocolytic therapy for preterm labour can be made.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-24 22:10:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional studies are urgently needed to explore the relationships between combinations of tocolytics versus any other treatment for preterm labour. These studies should prioritise (where appropriate) the inclusion of commonly used tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers and/or oxytocin antagonists. Reporting of a range of maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity outcomes, as well as reporting the use of antenatal corticosteroids, is needed in order to obtain meaningful data for clinical decision-making. </P>
