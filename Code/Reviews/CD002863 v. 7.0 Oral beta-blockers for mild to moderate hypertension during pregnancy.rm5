<P>Substantive amendment</P>
<P>This update includes two new trials. For transparency, the text now indicates, for each relative risk, the number of trials and the number of women that contributed to that outcome.</P>
<P>The results are largely unchanged, in that it is still unclear whether treatment of mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension, with oral beta-blockers, results in greater benefit than risk versus no treatment. The only difference in the results is that when beta-blockers are now compared with any other antihypertensive drug, beta-blockers are associated with a lower risk of small-for-gestational-age infants, although this effect is borderline for statistical significance.<BR/>

<P>Pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension taking beta-blockers have reduced blood pressure, but these drugs may have adverse effects on the baby.</P>
<P>While very high blood pressure (hypertension) in pregnancy can damage blood vessel walls and lead to serious complications, small rises in blood pressure may do little harm. The blood pressure level at which treatment should be started in pregnancy is not known. Beta-blocker drugs cause the heart to beat more slowly and less forcefully, reducing pressure on blood vessels. This review of trials found that pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension who take beta-blockers have lower blood pressure, but the baby may grow more slowly than expected. There is not enough evidence on other effects. Further research is needed.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-nine trials (approximately 2500 women) are included. Thirteen trials (1480 women) compared beta-blockers with placebo/no beta blocker. Oral beta-blockers decrease the risk of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 11 trials, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensives (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). There are insufficient data for conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 12 trials; N = 1346 women). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased, neonatal bradycardia increased and respiratory distress syndrome decreased, but these outcomes are reported in only a small proportion of trials. In 13 trials (854 women), beta-blockers were compared with methyldopa. Beta-blockers appear to be no more effective and probably equally as safe. Single small trials have compared beta-blockers with hydralazine, nicardipine or isradipine. It is unusual for women to change drugs due to side effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 12:28:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in SGA infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 12:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>During normal pregnancy, blood pressure falls, reaching its lowest level at about 20 weeks' gestation, and then rises slowly to reach pre-pregnancy levels by term. In up to 10% of pregnancies, blood pressure rises above the accepted norm, usually defined as &gt; 140/90 mm Hg. A large proportion of antenatal care is devoted to the detection and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy because, as a group, they are the second major cause of maternal and perinatal serious illness (e.g. stroke or preterm birth, respectively) and/or death in both low to middle income and high income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is a term used to describe two fundamentally different, but related, conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1989</LINK>). The first is hypertension that occurs for the first time during the latter half of pregnancy, termed pregnancy-induced hypertension. Pregnancy-induced hypertension may occur in isolation or be associated with multi-organ dysfunction (classically, proteinuria) when it is referred to as pre-eclampsia. The second condition is chronic hypertension that existed before pregnancy or presents in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. These conditions must be considered separately because they have different implications for mother and baby. </P>
<P>Chronic hypertension affects approximately one in 100 pregnancies. It is associated with an excess of pregnancy complications, accounted for mainly by women who develop superimposed pre-eclampsia. Chronic hypertension is usually due to essential hypertension, but may result from other medical problems such as kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. </P>
<P>Pregnancy-induced hypertension is relatively common, affecting up to one in 10 pregnancies. It is more likely to occur in women with a family history of hypertension or other medical problems, such as obesity or kidney disease. Pre-eclampsia, specifically, also tends to occur in first pregnancies and multiple pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder that can also affect blood clotting, liver function, kidney function, and/or brain function. In addition, the placenta may be affected, leading to poor fetal growth, and possibly preterm birth. In some women, severe hypertension may occur quickly. Aspirin is the only therapy proven to decrease the risk of pre-eclampsia in women at increased risk (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2002</LINK>), but the magnitude of risk reduction is modest. The only definitive treatment of pre-eclampsia, once established, is delivery of the baby. Even so, pre-eclampsia may still worsen (or develop for the first time) in the immediate postpartum period; there is usually a full recovery. </P>
<P>Marked elevations of blood pressure, to levels at or above 170 mm Hg systolic and/or 110 mm Hg diastolic, may damage maternal blood vessels and possibly increase the risk of partial separation of the placenta from the womb (placental abruption). This is the case regardless of whether this high blood pressure is due to chronic hypertension, isolated pregnancy-induced hypertension, or pre-eclampsia. There is general agreement that such women should receive antihypertensive therapy, that will lower the blood pressure and, hence, may prevent some of the consequences of severe hypertension. This issue is covered by a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2002</LINK>). When the blood pressure is less markedly elevated, to levels below 170/110 mm Hg, there is little risk of such direct damage, and there is no agreement as to whether or not antihypertensive therapy is of benefit to either the woman or the child (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>One international working group has advocated treatment of a diastolic blood pressure greater than 105 mm Hg (<LINK REF="REF-NHB-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHB 2000</LINK>), whereas others recommend treatment of a diastolic BP of 90 to 95 mm Hg (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>). The possible risks and benefits of various approaches are not known. </P>
<P>Antihypertensive agents are often given to lower maternal blood pressure in the hope that this will delay progression of the disease and so prolong the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1993</LINK>); this hypothesis is unproven, however. There are potential benefits, for both mother (such as fewer hospital visits and less time in hospital) and baby (such as better survival and fewer problems after birth), but there are also potential risks. Firstly, it has been suggested that beta-blockers may themselves be associated with intrauterine growth restriction (<LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1990</LINK>). Secondly, many of the commonly used agents (e.g. methyldopa) may cause drowsiness and dizziness, as well as other less common problems (e.g. abnormal liver tests). Thirdly, it has been argued that antihypertensive treatment removes an accessible marker for pre-eclampsia, and that normal blood pressures may give false reassurance . Finally, there is very little information about the long-term safety for the child after antihypertensive exposure during pregnancy. A woman should not be advised to take drugs during pregnancy unless we can provide reasonable reassurance that they are both effective and safe. </P>
<P>In summary, while most clinicians would agree that severe hypertension should be treated to prevent maternal vascular damage, antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy remains controversial. At these levels of blood pressure, there is no direct risk to the mother, so treatment is only likely to be worthwhile if it delays or prevents progression of pre-eclampsia and/or is associated with substantive benefit(s) for the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Whilst a wide variety of antihypertensive agents have been used during pregnancy, this review summarises only the data on a commonly used class of agents, beta-blockers. The interested reader is referred to another review of all oral antihypertensive agents for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2002</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether oral beta-blockers are, overall, better than placebo or no therapy for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.</P>

<P>We extracted trial characteristics and outcome data independently and were not blinded to the results or other parts of the reports. We only included data from graphs if we both agreed on the estimate. When needed, we requested further (missing) information from the authors. </P>
<P>We rated methodological quality according to whether the participants could guess what the next allocated treatment would be. We defined concealment of allocation as:<BR/>(A) 'adequate' if the method was described in enough detail to be reasonably confident that the allocation was blinded (e.g. randomisation by telephone, or by consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>(B) 'unclear' if the method of randomisation was not described in enough detail to give reasonable reassurance that the allocation was blinded ;<BR/>(C) 'inadequate' if methods were quasi-randomised and the potential for bias was unacceptably high. </P>

<P>We rated completeness of follow up (for each outcome) according to the proportion of participants who were excluded from the analysis of that outcome, as follows: <BR/>(A) less than 2.5% of women;<BR/>(B) 2.5 to 9.9%;<BR/>(C) 10 to 19.9%. </P>

<P>We used the Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>) to enter data and to perform the analyses. A statistically significant treatment effect was reflected by a relative risk (RR) for which the 95% confidence interval did not include 1.0; a RR greater than 1.0 reflected more events among the treatment (i.e. beta-blocker) groups and a RR less than 1.0 reflected more events among control groups. Significant between-trial heterogeneity was explained descriptively according to trial quality, the women enrolled, interventions administered, and/or outcome definitions/assessment. For the beta-blocker versus other antihypertensive comparisons, the analysis was stratified by type of other antihypertensive, as the latter was considered a priori to be a potential source of between-trial heterogeneity in outcome. </P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 12:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Characteristics of participants were poorly described in most reports. In the majority, it was not possible to tell whether participants had isolated hypertension or pre-eclampsia. In two trials, antihypertensive therapy was started early in the second trimester (<LINK REF="STD-USA-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1990</LINK>); otherwise, therapy was started late in the second trimester or in the third trimester. Eleven trials compared oral beta-blockers with placebo (seven trials) or no therapy, for women enrolled in the late second trimester or third trimester. Eighteen trials compared beta-blockers with other antihypertensive therapy for women in the third trimester. </P>
<P>Labetalol was the most commonly used beta-blocker (11 trials); other drugs used were metoprolol (four trials), pindolol (four trials), atenolol (four trials), oxprenolol (three trials), propranolol (two trials), acebutolol (one trial) and mepindolol (two trials). Two trials had two beta-blocker treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Israel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-France-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">France 1988a</LINK>), which accounts for the fact that 31 beta-blockers are listed for only 29 trials.</P>
<P>When oral beta-blockers were compared with other drugs, methyldopa was most commonly used (13 trials); other comparative drugs were hydralazine (three trials), nicardipine (one trial), and isradipine (one trial). </P>
<P>Trials were excluded based on failure to report data according to the randomised group (unless this information was available directly from authors), examination of endpoints not relevant to the overview (e.g. Doppler velocimetry), single dose studies remote from term (as the drug could not be expected to be on board at delivery and impact on neonatal health), and direct comparison of beta-blocker with beta-blocker.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Twenty-nine trials with approximately 2500 women are included in this review. The trials themselves were all small with a median [range] sample size of 60 [20, 200]. The quality of these trials was poor. Concealment of treatment allocation was 'adequate' in only five (17%) reports and 'unclear' in most others; two trials with clearly inadequate methods (<LINK REF="STD-Italy-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Italy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuwait-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kuwait 1995</LINK>) were excluded from the analysis. Double blinding (of physicians and patients) for outcome assessment was reported to have occurred in seven trials (24%). For maternal and pregnancy outcomes, follow up of greater than 90% was achieved for all outcomes in 20 trials (69%); long-term follow up was very limited, as the duration of follow up was rarely more than a few days after delivery.</P>

Oral beta-blockers substantially reduced the incidence of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 1 trial, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensive drugs (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). This did not appear to be reflected in any overall effect on proteinuria (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; 11 trials, N = 1340 women) or caesarean section (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12; 12 trials, N = 1392 women) although a moderate increase or decrease in either has not been excluded. The number of admissions to hospital before delivery was also reduced (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.93; 3 trials, N = 291 women), but this result should be interpreted with caution as only three trials reported this outcome and there is considerable potential for bias. Many trials did not report side effects per se, but beta-blockers seem to be well tolerated by women, as very few on active treatment changed their drug due to side effects. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about other maternal outcomes. Maternal stroke, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were not reported by any of the trials, and few mentioned maternal death, eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data for any conclusions about the possible effects of beta-blockers on perinatal mortality. There were 10 deaths in each arm, and the confidence intervals include everything from a halving to over a doubling in perinatal deaths. The effect on the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants is difficult to determine. For the twelve trials reporting this outcome, the summary RR is 1.36, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82 (12 trials, N = 1346 women). Although the result of one small trial appears to be different, the 95% CI is wide and overlaps with those of all of the other trials. This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1990</LINK>) randomised 33 women with chronic hypertension to atenolol versus placebo early in pregnancy (as in <LINK REF="STD-USA-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1987a</LINK>), and had two post-randomisation exclusions from the control group for severe hypertension. Also, if this trial is removed from the analysis, the effect size is essentially unchanged, although the confidence interval just crosses statistical significance (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.74; 11 trials, N = 1317 women). Beta-blockers appear to increase the risk of neonatal bradycardia based on data from three trials that reported this outcome (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.53; 3 trials, N = 416 women), but there is considerable heterogeneity that could not be explained. Beta-blockers may decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67; 4 trials, N = 567 women) based on data from the four trials that reported this outcome, although there is no apparent influence on the incidence of preterm birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.30; 8 trials, N = 962 women). No study reported on prolonged stay in a special care baby unit (SCBU) (e.g. more than 7 days). The data available on follow up beyond the perinatal period are limited to those from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1983</LINK>) which found no difference in the rates of cerebral palsy or low IQ at one year of age.</P>
<P>It should be noted that few maternal (i.e. severe hypertension, proteinuria at delivery, caesarean section) or perinatal (i.e. mortality) outcomes were reported by the majority of included trials. Therefore, given the potential for bias, data on inadequately reported outcomes should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">B. Beta-blockers versus other antihypertensive agents</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen trials (854 women) compared beta-blockers with methyldopa. There are no clear maternal or perinatal advantages or disadvantages associated with oral beta-blockers, when compared with methyldopa. However, the confidence intervals are all wide and no maternal or perinatal outcomes were reported by the majority of included trials. Therefore, given the potential for bias, data on outcomes should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Single trials have compared beta-blockers with hydralazine, nicardipine, or isradipine. These were too small for any reliable conclusions to be drawn.</P>
<P>When beta-blockers were compared with any other antihypertensive drug, beta-blockers were associated with a lower risk of small-for-gestational-age infants, and this effect was borderline for statistical significance (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; 7 trials, N = 485 women). There was insufficient evidence for any firm conclusions about the effects on any other outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Not surprisingly, when prescribed for mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy and compared with placebo/no therapy, oral beta-blockers decrease the incidence of severe hypertension and the need for additional antihypertensive therapy. These effects would only be worthwhile if they were reflected in other more substantive benefits (such as a decrease in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia for the mother, and/or a decrease in preterm birth and its complications for the baby), or if they reduced the need for hospital admission; no such benefits have yet been clearly demonstrated. Specifically, better control of blood pressure does not seem to influence the progression to pre-eclampsia or the risk of caesarean section, although these data are compatible with the true effect being anything from moderate benefit to a small increase in risk. Data on other outcomes are insufficient for any reliable conclusions to be made.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data for any conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality. When compared with placebo/no therapy, beta-blockers are associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age infants. This result is partly dependent on one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1990</LINK>), which may be exaggerating the real effect. Although this trial was of poor quality, other potential explanations include a specific effect of atenolol (<LINK REF="REF-Easterling-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterling 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lydakis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lydakis 1999</LINK>) or the fact that the drug was started early in pregnancy. In addition, a recent meta-regression analysis of all trials of antihypertensive medication for mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension found an association between treatment-induced fall in mean arterial pressure (by administration of any antihypertensive agent) and an increased risk of small for gestational infants (<LINK REF="REF-von-Dadelszen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Dadelszen 2000</LINK>). This would suggest that if the effect of beta-blockers on fetal growth were real, it might not be specific to beta-blockers. </P>
<P>Beta-blockers appear to be associated with an excess of neonatal bradycardia. This may reflect reporting bias but, even if real, this may be a pharmacological effect of beta-blockers rather than a clinically important one, given that the one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scotland-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Scotland 1983</LINK>) which found a significant increase in bradycardia did so by performing continuous monitoring of neonatal heart rate. No affected newborn required treatment. Finally, beta-blockers appear to decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome although, again, there was potential for bias as few studies reported the outcome. Also, the apparent effect on respiratory distress was not associated with any change in preterm birth, and the incidence was high given that babies were born at or near term. In view of the selective reporting, it remains unclear whether this reflects some direct effect of beta-blockers on the fetal lung. </P>
<P>When compared with methyldopa, there are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions. There is even less information about how beta-blockers compare with other agents. Even when all trials comparing beta-blockers with alternative antihypertensive drugs are taken together, there is insufficient evidence for any firm conclusions about the comparative effects, although it is possible that the risk of a small-for-gestational-age infant may be less with beta-blocker therapy than with an alternative drug. </P>
<P>The low frequency with which women need to change drugs suggests that if antihypertensive therapy is considered to be necessary, then the choice of agent should be based on the clinician's personal experience and/or maternal and/or perinatal considerations.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 12:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Beta blockers, along with other antihypertensive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2002</LINK>), reduce the risk of severe hypertension, and the need for additional drugs. Overall, however, it is unclear whether they do more good than harm. Beta-blockers, when compared with placebo or no antihypertensive therapy, seem to be associated with an increase in the risk of small-for-gestational-age infants, but the size of this effect is unclear. When compared with other antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers seem to be associated with a comparative decrease in small-for-gestational-age infants, although this effect is borderline for statistical significance. The impact of beta-blockers (and antihypertensive therapy in general) on intrauterine fetal growth is important to clarify, as even a relatively modest increase in risk could have considerable clinical importance, given that being small for gestational age is associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbidity, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and possibly, cardiovascular disease in later life. If the clinician feels that antihypertensive therapy is indicated for a woman with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, beta-blockers should be considered as candidate agents. The possible exception to this is atenolol, which it would seem sensible to avoid.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-04 12:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large, randomised placebo-controlled trials are required to determine whether, overall, antihypertensive therapy (with any agent) is preferable to no treatment of mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. Beta-blockers should be considered as relevant drugs to evaluate. Outcomes should include measures of clinical effectiveness (for both the mother and child), importance to women and use of health service resources. These would include pre-eclampsia, health-related quality of life, perinatal and infant mortality, admission to special care baby unit for more than 7 days, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and measures of major disability in the short- and long-term (e.g. cerebral palsy). If treatment is beneficial overall, it would then be appropriate to conduct trials of one antihypertensive drug compared with another.</P>
