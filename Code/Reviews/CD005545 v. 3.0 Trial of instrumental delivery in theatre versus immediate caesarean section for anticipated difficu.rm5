<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Most women give birth spontaneously, but some need assistance during the second stage of labour with obstetric forceps or the vacuum. The rates of instrumental vaginal births range from 5% to 20% of all births in high-income countries, with little information about the incidence in low-income countries. Indications for instrumental vaginal births are generally fetal heart rate abnormalities, poor position of the baby, maternal exhaustion and some maternal medical conditions such as heart disease. The majority of instrumental vaginal births are conducted in the delivery room, but in a small proportion of anticipated difficult births (2% to 5%), a trial of instrumental vaginal birth is conducted in theatre with preparations made for proceeding to caesarean section. It has been suggested that for these anticipated difficult assisted vaginal births, it may be preferable to go straight to caesarean section. The advantage of doing an immediate caesarean section would be a reduced risk of morbidity for both mother and baby from a failed attempted instrumental birth. However, the disadvantages of routinely doing a caesarean section in these circumstances are an increased risk of morbidity from caesarean section which often manifests itself at a subsequent birth. The review of trials looking at attempted instrumental delivery in theatre versus immediate caesarean section for anticipated difficult births identified no trials to help with making this decision. Further research is clearly needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:05:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The majority of women have spontaneous vaginal birth but some need assistance in the second stage with the birth of their baby. The second stage of labour is defined as the interval between achieving full cervical dilatation and the birth of the baby. The second stage can be subdivided into a passive phase, where the woman has no urge to push, and an active phase, when the woman is bearing down during contractions. During the passive phase, the presenting part descends to below the ischial spines and the fetal head usually rotates to an occipito-anterior position. The optimal duration of the second stage remains undefined, but a mean of 70 minutes, with 79% of women experiencing a second stage of less than two hours has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Janni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janni 2002</LINK>). There is, however, no evidence that a second stage lasting more than two hours is detrimental to the fetus if adequate monitoring is provided. The duration of the second stage can be affected by the use of analgesia, especially epidural, that may remove the urge to push (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001</LINK>). In women with an epidural, directed pushing should be discouraged until the presenting part descends below the spines. Delaying pushing to more than two hours after full cervical dilatation reduces difficult deliveries in women with epidurals (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2000</LINK>). The phase of active pushing is accompanied by a decline in fetal pH and there are recommendations for this to be shortened (<LINK REF="REF-Nordstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2003</LINK>). Failure to progress in the second stage may be due to malposition of the fetal head, ineffective uterine contractions or feto-pelvic disproportion. An oxytocin infusion commenced in the second stage to correct ineffective uterine contractions shortens the second stage and reduces instrumental deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1989</LINK>). It is sometimes recommended that the active phase should not exceed an hour in primigravida and should be shorter in multiparous women (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sizer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sizer 2000</LINK>). However, the recent UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for intrapartum care recommend that birth would be expected to take place within three hours of the start of the active second stage for primagravida, and two hours for multiparous women (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). Increased rates of caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth and perineal trauma (third- and fourth-degree tears) with second stage longer than one hour have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2004</LINK>). Although the length of the second stage was not associated with poor neonatal outcome, prolonged second stage is associated with increased maternal morbidity and instrumental vaginal birth rates. There is no evidence to support arbitrary time limits for the duration of the second stage. Active pushing is associated with fetal acidosis and denervation injury to maternal perineal muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002b</LINK>). Maternal positions in labour that promote descent of presenting part are helpful in shortening the duration of the second stage.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:06:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Instrumental vaginal delivery is when obstetric forceps or the vacuum extractor is used to assist delivery of the baby. Rates of instrumental vaginal delivery range from 5% to 20% of all births in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Janni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002a</LINK>). Indications for instrumental vaginal delivery may be for fetal or maternal reasons, or for both. Fetal conditions in which instrumental vaginal delivery may be required include fetal heart rate abnormality and malposition of the fetal head such as occipito-posterior. Maternal exhaustion and medical conditions in which expulsive effort must be reduced, such as cardiac disease, may also necessitate an assisted second stage.</P>
<P>The majority of instrumental vaginal deliveries are conducted in the delivery room but in a small proportion (2% to 5%) a trial of instrumental vaginal delivery is conducted in theatre with preparations made for proceeding to caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Mola-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mola 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2001b</LINK>). Although all instrumental vaginal deliveries can be considered a trial, there are clinical factors such as malposition and level of presenting part that may influence the operator in deciding on delivery in the room or in theatre. However, there are no agreed criteria for a trial of instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre.</P>
<P>The decision to perform instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre indicates that the operator anticipates a difficult delivery with a higher than average risk of failure. For a long time, trial of instrumental vaginal delivery has been considered an acceptable alternative to caesarean section for delay in the second stage due to a potentially difficult mid-cavity arrest (<LINK REF="REF-Lowe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 1987</LINK>). There are reports that suggest increased maternal and neonatal morbidity following failed trial of instrumental vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiner 2001</LINK>). But other reports suggest that failed trial of instrumental vaginal delivery does not increase maternal and neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Revah-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revah 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:07:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The decision to attempt instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre is subjective, with wide variation among practitioners, and is influenced by the local practical arrangements for conducting a trial in theatre. Some trials of instrumental vaginal delivery fail to complete delivery by the vaginal route and caesarean section is performed. Failed trial of instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre is associated with a shorter interval between failure of trial and delivery by caesarean section when compared to a failed attempt conducted in the delivery room. However, trial in theatre may be associated with a longer decision to delivery interval (<LINK REF="REF-Olagundoye-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olagundoye 2007</LINK>). Factors that reduce chances of successful trial of instrumental vaginal delivery include nulliparity, malposition of the fetal head, high level of the head, deflexed head and reduced pelvic capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Kadri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Kadri 2003</LINK>). The skills of the operator may affect outcome of trial of instrumental vaginal delivery. An experienced practitioner is likely to have a higher success rate by careful patient selection. On the other hand, a cautious but less experienced operator may also have a high success rate through conducting the majority of instrumental vaginal deliveries as trials in theatre. In some settings there are protocols for a trial of instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre such as senior obstetrician approval. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has produced some guidance on instrumental vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2005</LINK>). The potential effect of implementing the guidelines may be an increase in trials in theatre.</P>
<P>Failure rates of instrumental vaginal delivery ranging from 16% to 20% have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sau 2004</LINK>). Immediate caesarean section without trial of instrumental vaginal delivery would increase caesarean section rate through performing caesarean section in women who could have had a successful trial of instrumental vaginal delivery. The fetal head is likely to be impacted in a second stage caesarean section, especially following failed instrumental delivery. Disengagement of the deeply wedged head during caesarean section can be difficult as well as traumatic (<LINK REF="REF-Blickstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blickstein 2004</LINK>). Techniques for disengagement include pushing by an assistant or pulling the baby by the feet and delivery by breech extraction. Caesarean section also has implications for future pregnancies, with an increased risk of repeat operation and scar rupture. However, a difficult instrumental vaginal delivery may be associated with increased neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiner 2001</LINK>). Long-term effects of instrumental vaginal delivery include perineal pain, incontinence and sexual problems (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liebling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebling 2004</LINK>). Caesarean section after failed trial of instrumental vaginal delivery is associated with technical difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2005</LINK>). There is variation in threshold for performing trial of instrumental vaginal delivery. Some practitioners feel that if there is a 50% chance of success, trial of instrumental vaginal delivery is justified. When instrumental vaginal delivery is set up as a trial, high failure rates have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lowe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 1987</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:07:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>It is important to assess the comparative morbidity for women and babies of undertaking an anticipated difficult instrumental vaginal birth in theatre compared with undertaking an immediate caesarean section. We did not assess the merits of the different instruments used for instrumental vaginal delivery since this was the subject of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1999</LINK>). That review concluded that, compared to forceps, the vacuum extractor appeared to reduce maternal morbidity. However, local practice and operator preference usually influence the choice of instrument.</P>

<P>We would have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We would have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we would have re-included missing data in the analyses which were undertaken.</P>
<P> We would have assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing data, missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We would have made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we would have assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We would have explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see 'Sensitivity analysis'.</P>

<P>We would have carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would have used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-09 09:10:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is a need for randomised trials to address this important area of clinical practice. This may require a multi-centre trial that could be co-ordinated by one of the centres with experience in such trials. There is a wide variation in rates of failed trial of instrumental delivery. A trial of instrumental delivery in theatre indicates that the operator anticipates a difficult birth. Research would provide an answer to whether a caesarean section for failure to progress in the second stage has similar maternal and neonatal outcomes to caesarean section after a failed trial of instrumental delivery. Research would also examine factors that increase risk of an unsuccessful trial and provide useful information to help in designing clinical guidelines for trial of instrumental delivery. Since some of the serious morbidity associated with caesarean section comes at a subsequent pregnancy and birth, and some of the morbidity associated with instrumental vaginal birth is long term, these issues will need to be adequately addressed in any future trial.</P>
