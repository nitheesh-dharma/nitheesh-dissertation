<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In health, protein and amino acids remain in equilibrium however in CKD this balance is disturbed. Metabolic acidosis has been shown to have deleterious effects on protein balance, leading to a negative nitrogen balance, increased protein degradation, increased essential amino acid oxidation, reduced albumin synthesis and a lack of adaption to a low protein diet, and hence is associated with protein energy malnutrition, loss of lean body mass and muscle weakness. Metabolic acidosis is also a factor in the development of renal bone disease, as bone acts as a buffer for excess acid, with loss of mineral resulting from the increase in acid. This review found three small trials in adult haemodialysis patients (n = 117). The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients and none in children. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide strong evidence.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-03-04 15:21:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has adverse consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy. Metabolic acidosis may be corrected by oral bicarbonate supplementation or in dialysis patients by increasing the bicarbonate concentration in dialysate fluid.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the benefits and harms of treating metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, both prior to reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT), with sodium bicarbonate or increasing the bicarbonate concentration of dialysate. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:48:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta-analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, with no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:31:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Kalandar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalandar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopple-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopple 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In health, protein and amino acids remain in equilibrium however in CKD this balance is disturbed (<LINK REF="REF-Mitch-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitch 1993</LINK>). Metabolic acidosis has been shown to have deleterious effects on protein balance, leading to a negative nitrogen balance, increased protein degradation, increased essential amino acid oxidation, reduced albumin synthesis and a lack of adaption to a low protein diet, and hence is associated with protein energy malnutrition, loss of lean body mass and muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Kalandar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalandar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>). Metabolic acidosis is also associated with inflammatory mediators, reduced leptin, insulin resistance, increased corticosteroid production and PTH production (<LINK REF="REF-Kalandar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalandar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehrotra-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehrotra 2003</LINK>). The mechanism for reducing protein may include effects on ATP-dependent ubiquitin proteosome and increased activity of branched chain keto acid dehydrogenases. In the NHANES III prevalence study hypoalbuminaemia (a marker of protein energy malnutrition and a powerful predictive marker of mortality in renal failure and the general population) was independently associated with low bicarbonate as well as the inflammatory marker CRP (<LINK REF="REF-Eustace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustace 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Metabolic acidosis is a factor in the development of renal osteodystrophy, as bone acts as a buffer for excess acid, with loss of mineral resulting (<LINK REF="REF-Kalandar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalandar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraut-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraut 2000</LINK>). Acidosis may interfere with vitamin D metabolism, and patients who are persistently more acidotic are more likely to have osteomalacia or low-turnover bone disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bushinsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushinsky 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most observational studies of nutrition and metabolic acidosis in dialysis patients have found an inverse relationship thought to be due to reverse epidemiology with higher protein intake (i.e. good appetite) associated with a degree of acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kalandar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalandar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2002</LINK>). In the DOPPS study of haemodialysis (HD) patients, severe acidosis (&lt; 16 mEq/L) was associated with higher risk of mortality and hospitalisation though patients with mild acidosis had better outcomes than patients with normal range bicarbonate (<LINK REF="REF-Bommer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bommer 2004</LINK>). This J-shaped curve has also been found by <LINK REF="REF-Lowrie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowrie 1990</LINK> in analysis of dialysis patients.</P>
<P>Metabolic acidosis may be corrected in dialysis by increasing the bicarbonate in dialysate fluid or by giving oral sodium bicarbonate. In pre end-stage renal disease (ESRD) some correction of acidosis is observed when alkaline calcium salts are used as phosphate binders, but the main method is the administration of oral sodium bicarbonate. Patients prescribed bicarbonate have to take between 6 to 12 tablets/day. The switch to a non-calcium containing binder such as sevelamer hydrochloride may lead to more acidosis. One potential undesired effect of sodium bicarbonate is the exacerbation of salt and water retention resulting in a worsening of hypertension or oedema or both. Limited evidence in humans suggests that this is more of a problem when sodium chloride is used (<LINK REF="REF-Husted-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husted 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been several short-term non-randomised intervention studies showing various effects of correction of acidosis on markers of protein balance (<LINK REF="REF-Kooman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kooman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Movilli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Movilli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reaich-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Reaich 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verove 2002</LINK>) and to lesser extent on markers of bone turnover and calcium phosphate balance (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The absolute benefits to patients of acidosis correction are not clearly identified. It is important therefore to systematically review the randomised evidence on the correction of metabolic acidosis. This review focuses on the treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD both prior to reaching end stage renal failure (ESRF) and whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT). The prevention of acidosis by different dialysis buffers (acetate-free haemodialysis (HD) and lactate buffering in peritoneal dialysis (PD)) were not reviewed here.</P>

<P>The review was largely undertaken by two authors (PR, NW). The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that might have been relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently and discarded if not applicable, however studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on trials were retained initially. The retrieved abstracts were screened independently and, if necessary the full text of these studies, to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was carried out independently by the same authors using standard data extraction forms. There were no studies reported in non-English language journals.

<P>1708 titles and abstracts were retrieved of which 87 were potentially relevant. We excluded 84 - 19 reviews, 23 observational studies, 17 non-randomised interventions, 16 RCTs undertaken in all patients irrespective of acidosis (10 of differing PD fluid pH, 5 of differing HD fluid and 1 in pre-ESRD patients) and 9 duplicates.</P>
<P>No eligible trials were identified in pre-ESRD patients or in children. Three trials were found in dialysis patients, one in PD (<LINK REF="STD-Szeto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 2003</LINK>) and two in HD (<LINK REF="STD-Brady-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lefebrve-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lefebrve 1989</LINK>) with a total of 117 patients being randomised. Two trials recruited patients on the basis of definite acidosis, though with different levels (&lt;16 mEq/L (<LINK REF="STD-Brady-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 1998</LINK>), &lt;25 mEq/L (<LINK REF="STD-Szeto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 2003</LINK>) and in the third acidosis was presumed though baseline bicarbonate was 16 mEq/L (<LINK REF="STD-Lefebrve-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lefebrve 1989</LINK>). The intervention was oral bicarbonate in one, increase in dialysis fluid bicarbonate in one and a combination in the two in the third trial.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:31:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials are underpowered to provide robust evidence. One trial only partly corrected the acidosis (<LINK REF="STD-Brady-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 1998</LINK>) which may have explained why there was no change in the primary marker of nutritional status albumin. <LINK REF="STD-Szeto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 2003</LINK> suggested that correction of even mild acidosis maybe beneficial. <LINK REF="STD-Lefebrve-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lefebrve 1989</LINK> suggested that the secondary hyperparathyroidism seen in patients with high bone turnover could be reversed, and bone turnover stimulated in those with low turnover.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Szeto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 2003</LINK> had any data on clinical outcomes (hospitalisation and mortality). There were no data on patient quality of life after correction. Whilst correction of acidosis appeared well tolerated with no evident effects on weight, sodium or blood pressure it is important to note a non significant increase in admissions for heart failure in <LINK REF="STD-Szeto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 2003</LINK>. This suggests that one cannot reliably extrapolate results to pre-ESRD where the long-term use of oral sodium bicarbonate has not been evaluated especially in those at risk from sodium fluid loading (e.g. those with oedema, hypertension or heart failure).</P>
<P>In PD there have been some trials which have evaluated the effect of buffering the unphysiologic acidic PD dialysis fluid in all patients not just those with acidosis (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Carrasco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Carrasco 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1997</LINK>). Primary outcomes have often been markers of intra-peritoneal inflammation. However <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1997</LINK> was a good sized (n = 200) RCT within one year follow-up using more lactate in the PD fluid to increase serum bicarbonate as well as using oral bicarbonate supplementation in the high lactate group. The difference in bicarbonate achieved was 27 mmol/L versus 23 mmol/L in the high versus low groups. The high group had some better nutritional markers at one year (weight gain, mid arm circumference) and reduced hospital admissions and days in hospital. There is a need to systematically review such studies.</P>
<P>The widespread use of bicarbonate HD will have reduced the frequency of acidosis in HD patients. Use of acetate-free biofiltration (AFB) compared to standard bicarbonate HD in all HD patients (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Verzetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verzetti 1998</LINK>) may further reduce acidosis. A systematic review of such studies found that overall the trials were small, poorly designed, of insufficient duration with variable reporting of outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Rabindranath-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabindranath 2006</LINK>), No significant differences were found for dialysis related symptoms; data on bicarbonate levels, protein and bone metabolism were not reported, and there was insufficient evidence to favour any method. <LINK REF="STD-Gabutti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gabutti 2003</LINK> showed that overcorrection can lead to metabolic alkalosis which was associated with symptomatic hypotension on HD.</P>
<P>Some small non-randomised studies in HD patients have shown that correction may reduce secondary hyperparathyroidism (<LINK REF="STD-Movilli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Movilli 2001</LINK>), reduce protein degradation and increase albumin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Movilli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Movilli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiederkehr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiederkehr 2004</LINK>) and increase branched chain amino acids (<LINK REF="REF-Kooman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kooman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been some non-randomised uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reaich-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Reaich 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rustom 1998</LINK>) and a few cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Passfall-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Passfall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2002</LINK>), but most have been small (&lt; 20 patients) and of short duration (&lt; 8 weeks), the exception being a before and after study by <LINK REF="REF-Verove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verove 2002</LINK> (six months). In these studies there was no standard definition of acidosis nor a target level to which it should be corrected. There was variation between patients' diets during the studies, in some dietary intake was controlled in others the standard diet was used. Such studies provide some supporting evidence that sodium bicarbonate can correct acidosis and that it is well tolerated in the short-term with effects on protein metabolism as indicated by falls in urea levels (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verove 2002</LINK>), rising albumin (<LINK REF="REF-Verove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verove 2002</LINK>) fall in protein catabolic rate (<LINK REF="REF-Verove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verove 2002</LINK>) and reduction in more complex measures of protein degradation (<LINK REF="STD-Reaich-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Reaich 1993</LINK>). Less data on the effect of calcium phosphate metabolism or bone changes are available (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main limitation of this review was the scarcity of robust adequately powered RCTs of long duration in either pre-ESRD or dialysis patients.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:38:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<UL>
<LI>There is no randomised evidence to support the correction of acidosis in pre-ESRD patients by sodium bicarbonate supplementation or in children. Evidence in dialysis patients is very limited.</LI>
<LI>Sodium bicarbonate is an inexpensive and well tolerated drug, and increasing bicarbonate concentration in dialysis fluid is relatively straightforward: both are effective in correcting acidosis. These considerations no doubt help support positive guideline recommendations for acidosis correction.</LI>
<LI>Current guidelines have to rely on extrapolation from the few dialysis trials, non randomised data and consensus. KDOQI recommends maintaining predialysis bicarbonate &#8805; 22 mEq/L in all patients (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2000</LINK>), the UK Renal Association has different targets for CAPD (25-29 mmol/L) and HD (20-26 mmol/L) and a non specific target 'within normal range' for pre-ESRD patients (<LINK REF="REF-UKRA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKRA 2002</LINK>). The Australian CARI Guidelines for pre-ESRD patients recommend correction to over 22 mol/L based on Grade III evidence (<LINK REF="REF-CARI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CARI 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>However it is not known how rigorously identification and correction of acidosis is achieved in pre-ESRD patients. Registry data enable audit in dialysis patients. The potential adverse consequences of volume loading in patients at risk of fluid retention, or of over-correction leading to alkalosis which may precipitate calcium phosphorus and lead to symptomatic hypotension have not been fully addressed. Whether mild acidosis is actually beneficial in dialysis patients as indicated by observational data or whether this is just reverse epidemiology reflecting higher protein intake is uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>RCTs are needed to determine the benefits and risks of correction of acidosis in both pre-ESRD and dialysis patients and could consider at what bicarbonate level to initiate correction and what target level to achieve.</P>
