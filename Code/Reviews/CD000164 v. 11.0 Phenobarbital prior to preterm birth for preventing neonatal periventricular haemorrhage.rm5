<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:14:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Evidence does not support phenobarbital treatment to women giving birth before 34 weeks to decrease the risk of bleeding into the babies' brains.</P>
<P>Babies born very early (before 34 weeks) are at risk of bleeding in the brain (periventricular haemorrhage). This can be a cause of brain damage that might lead to disability including cerebral palsy. Phenobarbital may prevent injury to the brain by stabilising blood pressure and blood flow in the brain. Possible adverse effects of phenobarbital for the women include drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset and development of a rash.</P>
<P>Nine trials involving 1752 women were included in the review. The trials with low risk of bias found that phenobarbital given to women immediately prior to a very preterm birth did not decrease the risk of bleeding in the brains of the babies. No differences in child development were found on follow up at 18 to 24 months or at seven years.</P>
<P>Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital. The use of prenatal corticosteroids, known to reduce rates of periventricular haemorrhage, varied between trials and may have influenced findings.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:14:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Nine trials (1752 women) were included. Analyses of all included trials showed a significant reduction in the rates of all grades of PVH (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.83; nine trials; 1591 women) and severe grades PVH (3 and 4) (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.85; eight trials; 1527 women) in infants whose mothers had been given prenatal phenobarbital. These results were influenced by trials of poor quality which contributed excessive weight in the analysis due to their higher rates of severe PVH. When only the two higher quality trials were included, these beneficial effects disappeared for all grades of PVH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08; two trials; 945 women), and severe grades of PVH (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.83; two trials; 945 women).</P>
<P>No difference was found in the incidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities at paediatric follow up at 18 to 24 months or seven years of age between children born to mothers given prenatal phenobarbital and children not so exposed.<BR/>
<BR/>Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.37; one trial; 576 women).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-06 12:06:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent PVH in preterm infants or to protect them from neurological disability in childhood. Phenobarbital administration may lead to maternal sedation. If any future trials are carried out, they should measure neurodevelopmental status at follow up.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:07:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-20 04:01:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants born before 34 weeks' gestation have a significant risk of developing brain injury in association with periventricular haemorrhage (PVH). Severe forms of such lesions are strong predictors of later neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>The exact cause of these lesions is uncertain although it has been hypothesised that brain ischaemia followed by haemorrhage, usually arising initially in the subependymal germinal matrix, is the most likely explanation. Fluctuations in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion around birth and during early postnatal adaptation might also be involved. Most haemorrhages are manifest on head ultrasound within 72 hours of birth although the severity may change after this time (<LINK REF="REF-Vohr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haemorrhages are usually graded for severity:<BR/>grade 1 - confined to the germinal matrix;<BR/>grade 2 - in the lateral ventricle;<BR/>grade 3 - distending the ventricle;<BR/>grade 4 - intracerebral.</P>
<P>The latter two grades have been associated with long-term neurological sequelae.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-20 04:02:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous or oral phenobarbital given to women at risk of preterm birth.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-06 12:06:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Phenobarbital is a potential neuroprotective agent that might act by preventing ischaemic injury or by reducing the fluctuations in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Goddard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goddard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wimberley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wimberley 1982</LINK>). Phenobarbital has been suggested as a postnatal treatment and has been the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2007</LINK>). As many haemorrhages are thought to originate close to the time of birth, prophylactic prenatal rather than postnatal treatment may be preferable. Possible adverse effects for the women of phenobarbital include drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset, and a rash.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials' populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of I².</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Analysis of all trials</HEADING>
<P>Overall there was a significant reduction in the incidence of all grades of PVH (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.83; nine trials; 1591 infants) and in severe grades of PVH (3 and 4) (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.85; eight trials; 1527 infants) in infants exposed to prenatal phenobarbital using a random-effects model because of significant heterogeneity in the data. This result should be viewed with caution due to the high percentage of postrandomisation exclusions in many of the included studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Morales-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 1986</LINK> trial, the one quasi-randomised trial that did not have adequate allocation concealment, strongly influenced that result. When the meta-analysis was plotted with trials in chronological order, there was an apparent reduction in treatment effect with time apart for <LINK REF="STD-Mexico-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mexico 1998</LINK>. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Detroit-3-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 3 1996</LINK>), contributed half of the infants and was assessed by the review authors as having low bias risk. This study found no effect of phenobarbital on the risk of PVH.</P>
<P>There was a significant increase in infant deaths</P>
<P>discharge (RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.14 to 11.87; three trials; 1080 infants) in infants exposed to antenatal phenobarbital compared with those not so exposed but no such difference in stillbirths or death of live born infants prior to discharge between the phenobarbital and control groups. We observed non-significant trends towards a reduction in the combined outcomes of 'early infant death or severe PVH' and 'death before discharge or severe PVH' for infants exposed to prenatal phenobarbital. No differences were seen in other measures of neonatal morbidity.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-05 12:46:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The apparent benefit of prenatal phenobarbital in preventing periventricular haemorrhage (PVH), shown in earlier studies and in the overall analysis is unlikely to be a true effect of the drug. This is suggested by the disappearance of the effect when only high-quality trials are examined. In addition, there has been an increase in the rate of prenatal corticosteroid use, which is known to reduce rates of PVH (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Rates of prenatal corticosteroid use were around 30% in the earlier studies and have increased to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>) and 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Detroit-3-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 3 1996</LINK>) in some of the more recent trials, although were only 6% in the most recent trial reported (<LINK REF="STD-Mexico-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mexico 1998</LINK>). Phenobarbital may be less effective if corticosteroids have been given.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK> trial was potentially confounded by the use of vitamin K as a co-intervention with phenobarbital. Since vitamin K alone has not been shown to affect the rate of PVH (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2010a</LINK>), this is unlikely to confound the result.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-06 10:58:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>No data are available at present on the effects of phenobarbital when given to women prior to preterm birth at different gestational ages or birthweight strata. It is not recommended that phenobarbital be used in routine practice due to the poor quality of the current evidence and the questionable efficacy of phenobarbital in preventing PVH in the high-quality trial. Also only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Detroit-3-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 3 1996</LINK>) reported on the incidence of maternal sedation. Materal side effects must be assessed more completely before phenobarbital is accepted into routine practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:27:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Poor-quality trials contribute excessively to the weight in the overall analysis due to the higher rate of adverse outcomes in those trials. Others have criticised the poor quality of trials assessing prenatal phenobarbital (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1996</LINK>). The follow-up results of neurodevelopmental outcome are important, yet the results should be viewed with caution since the overall rate of follow up was suboptimal for all trials reporting data (losses to follow up: <LINK REF="STD-Detroit-2-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 2 1990</LINK>, 24% of infants at 36 months; <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>, 71% at two years, and 28% at seven years; <LINK REF="STD-Detroit-3-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 3 1996</LINK>, 35% at 18 to 22 months). In addition, there was an imbalance between the treatment and control groups in the ascertainment of women at risk in <LINK REF="STD-Detroit-2-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Detroit 2 1990</LINK>.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-05 12:46:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1994</LINK>), which was also the best quality trial, had vitamin K as a co-treatment with phenobarbital. Evidence from the systematic review of trials evaluating prenatal vitamin K prior to preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2010a</LINK>) suggests that vitamin K does not influence the rate of PVH.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:28:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent periventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants or to protect from childhood neurological disability. Phenobarbital administration leads to maternal sedation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-10 14:28:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>If any future trials are carried out, they should be of high quality, examine the effects of prenatal phenobarbital at gestational ages with a high risk of periventricular haemorrhage, stratify for gestational age and ensure minimal exclusions after randomisation. Neurodevelopmental status at follow up should be measured as the most important outcome.</P>

<P>Power calculation based on reduction of all PVH 50% to 25% and severe PVH 20% to 5%, needed 200. Interim analysis expanded the sample size because the frequency of severe IVH was substantially lower in the study compared to previous studies. Stopped trial early because baseline risk lower and no difference found.</P>
