If there are problems in how these professionals communicate and interact with each other, then problems in patient/client care can occur. IPC practice-based interventions are strategies put into place in healthcare settings to improve interactions and work processes between two or more types of healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review included studies which used a rigorous design (randomised controlled trials) to measure the effects of practice-based IPC interventions on the delivery of care to patients/clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this review, we found nine studies that evaluated the effects of practice-based IPC interventions. While most of these studies reported changes in the clinical process outcomes (the delivery of healthcare), such as drug use for nursing home residents, descreasing the length of hospital stay and reductions in hospital charges, two studies reported more mixed in relation to patient/client health outcomes. These studies reported that practice-based IPC interventions may slightly improve the delivery of care and patient health. However, further research is needed, including larger-scale replication studies to develop a better understanding of the range of possible interventions and their effectiveness, how they affect IPC and lead to changes in care and patient health outcomes, and in what circumstances such interventions may be most useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quality/certainty of the evidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the quality of evidence of the nine included studies it was found that IPC may slightly improve care delivery and patient health. However due to problems with the design of the studies as well as the interventions they aimed to investigate the certainty of evidence related to these studies was judged to be low to very low. To improve the quality/certainty of IPC research, future studies should gather both quantitative and qualitative data to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of IPC. Also, future studies should allow IPC interventions time to adjust to the clinical environment in which they are implemented as well as gather data for extended time periods after implementation to understand of the longer-term effects of IPC on delivery of care to patients/clients.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-06-20 09:36:12 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="0001" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<P>Conclusions changed, based on additional studies. Criteria for included study designs, included participants and specification of the intervention changed from the 1997 review. This first review included randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series designs, whereas this update included only randomised trials. The types of participants included in the first review were physicians and nurses, whereas this update included all types of healthcare professionals. The first review included studies in which the interventions may not have specified their intent to change interprofessional collaboration, whereas this update only included studies with an explicit focus on collaboration. These changes were intended to increase the validity of the conclusions, and to widen their applicability to professions other than nursing and medicine.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether strategies to improve interprofessional collaboration (the process by which different health and social care professional groups work together), can positively impact the delivery of care to patients. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question, and found nine studies with 5540 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
</P>
<P>Strategies to improve interprofessional collaboration between health and social care professionals may slightly improve patient functional status, professionals' adherence to recommended practices, and the use of healthcare resources. Due to the lack of clear evidence, we are uncertain whether the strategies improved patient-assessed quality of care, continuity of care, or collaborative working.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The extent to which different health and social care professionals work well together affects the quality of the care that they provide. If there are problems in how these professionals communicate and interact with each other, this can lead to problems in patient care. Interprofessional collaboration practice-based interventions are strategies that are put into place in healthcare settings to improve interactions and work processes between two or more types of healthcare professionals. This review studied different interprofessional collaboration interventions, compared to usual care or an alternative intervention, to see if they improved patient care or collaboration.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors found nine relevant studies across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings. All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) and lasted for up to 12 months. Most of the studies were well conducted, although some studies reported that many participants dropped out. The studies evaluated different methods of interprofessional collaboration, namely externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e.g. collaborative planning/reflection activities led by an individual who is not part of the group/team), interprofessional rounds, interprofessional meetings, and interprofessional checklists.</P>
<P>Externally facilitated interprofessional activities may slightly improve patient functional status and health care professionals' adherence to recommended practices, and may slightly improve use of healthcare resources. We are uncertain whether externally facilitated interprofessional activities improve patient-assessed quality of care, continuity of care, or collaborative working behaviours. The use of interprofessional rounds and interprofessional checklists may slightly improve the use of healthcare resources. Interprofessional meetings may slightly improve adherence to recommended practices, and may slightly improve use of healthcare resources.</P>
<P>Further research is needed, including studies testing the interventions at scale to develop a better understanding of the range of possible interventions and their effectiveness, how they affect interprofessional collaboration and lead to changes in care and patient health outcomes, and in what circumstances such interventions may be most useful.</P>
<P>
<B>How up to date is this review?</B>

<P>Poor interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can adversely affect the delivery of health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems have the potential to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:09:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to improve interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst health and social care professionals, compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention, on at least one of the following primary outcomes: patient health outcomes, clinical process or efficiency outcomes or secondary outcomes (collaborative behaviour).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-04 20:54:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to November 2015. We handsearched relevant interprofessional journals to November 2015, and reviewed the reference lists of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-30 11:23:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions involving health and social care professionals compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-04 20:55:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of study outcomes, given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in clinical settings, interventions and outcomes. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format to report study methods, outcomes, impact and certainty of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-20 02:05:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included nine studies in total (6540 participants); six cluster-randomised trials and three individual randomised trials (1 study randomised clinicians, 1 randomised patients, and 1 randomised clinicians and patients). All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings and had a follow-up of up to 12 months. Eight studies compared an IPC intervention with usual care and evaluated the effects of different practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e.g. team action planning; 4 studies), interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (1 study), and interprofessional checklists (1 study). One study compared one type of interprofessional meeting with another type of interprofessional meeting. We assessed four studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and an equal number of studies to be at high risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>For studies comparing an IPC intervention with usual care, functional status in stroke patients may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities (1 study, 464 participants, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether patient-assessed quality of care (1 study, 1185 participants), continuity of care (1 study, 464 participants) or collaborative working (4 studies, 1936 participants) are improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, as we graded the evidence as very low-certainty for these outcomes. Healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended practices may be slightly improved with externally facilitated interprofessional activities or interprofessional meetings (3 studies, 2576 participants, low certainty evidence). The use of healthcare resources may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, interprofessional checklists and rounds (4 studies, 1679 participants, low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on patient mortality, morbidity or complication rates.</P>
<P>Compared to multidisciplinary audio conferencing, multidisciplinary video conferencing may reduce the average length of treatment and may reduce the number of multidisciplinary conferences needed per patient and the patient length of stay. There was little or no difference between these interventions in the number of communications between health professionals (1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-30 11:43:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that the certainty of evidence from the included studies was judged to be low to very low, there is not sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions. Neverthess, due to the difficulties health professionals encounter when collaborating in clinical practice, it is encouraging that research on the number of interventions to improve IPC has increased since this review was last updated. While this field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. Future studies should focus on longer acclimatisation periods before evaluating newly implemented IPC interventions, and use longer follow-up to generate a more informed understanding of the effects of IPC on clinical practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-08 07:49:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-08 06:55:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is the process by which different health and social care professional groups work together to positively impact care. IPC involves regular negotiation and interaction between professionals, which values the expertise and contributions that various healthcare professionals bring to patient care. However, IPC can be affected by problems linked to imbalances of authority, limited understanding of others&#8217; roles and responsibilities, and professional boundary friction when delivering patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research has repeatedly documented the impact of collaboration problems on work processes and patient safety (<LINK REF="REF-Lillebo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lillebo 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Leijen_x002d_Zeelenberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Leijen-Zeelenberg 2015</LINK>). For example, failures of collaboration were found to be at the centre of a number of care failures across the globe (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-The-Joint-Commission-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Joint Commission 2016</LINK>). Therefore, professionals must ensure that they collaborate in an effective manner to deliver safe, high-quality patient care.</P>
<P>Different health policy makers across the globe have repeatedly called for the use of IPC as a key approach to improve the quality and safety of patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Health-Canada--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Canada 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). During the past 10 years in particular, IPC has been at the forefront of much curricular, research, policy, and regulatory activity at national and international levels. The promotion of IPC stems from the complexity and multifaceted nature of patients' health and care needs and the health system, and research that suggests that improved collaboration between multiple professionals may be essential for the provision of effective and comprehensive care.</P>
<P>Research in the area of IPC is complicated by the use of varied terms (interdisciplinary collaboration, multidisciplinary co-ordination, transprofessional teamwork), which has resulted in conceptual confusion within the field (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2010</LINK>). As a result, one must take care when evaluating such studies, to ensure one understands the nature and key activities of the intervention, whatever it may be named.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-04 21:25:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>An IPC intervention involves members of more than one health or social care profession interacting together with the explicit purpose of improving IPC. A scoping review examining the nature of interventions used in the interprofessional field found three main types: education-based interventions, practice-based interventions, and organisationally-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focuses on interprofessional practice-based interventions, also called practice-based IPC interventions. An interprofessional practice-based intervention involves the deployment in the workplace of a tool or routine to improve IPC; examples include communication tools, interprofessional meetings, and checklists.</P>
<P>A review focusing solely on interprofessional education (an education-based intervention) was recently updated (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2013</LINK>). In this review, an interprofessional education intervention was defined as 'members of more than one health or social care profession learning interactively together, for the explicit purpose of improving interprofessional collaboration, the health and well-being of patients, or both.' Interactive learning requires active learner participation and active exchange between learners from different professions.</P>
<P>An interprofessional organisationally-based intervention involves a change at an organisational level to improve interprofessional collaboration; examples include policy and staffing changes (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2010</LINK>). A review of the effects of this type of intervention still needs to be undertaken, to generate a more holistic understanding of the nature of these different, but complementary, interventions.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-27 16:56:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A practice-based IPC intervention might work by incorporating a tool, routine, or activity to improve interprofessional interaction (e.g. communication, co-ordination) into clinical practice.

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-08 07:49:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Research identifying various problems with IPC, and the delivery of care and patient outcomes, continues to accumulate (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_rner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Körner 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Leijen_x002d_Zeelenberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Leijen-Zeelenberg 2015</LINK>). Therefore, It is important to understand the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving IPC on health and social care. Governments around the globe continue to institute major changes and invest significant resources to improve IPC. Ideally, these policy decisions should be based on evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches. The aim of this review is to update a previous review, and synthesise evidence from randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions, to inform such decision-making (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Black-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2013</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of an externally facilitated IPC intervention, based in primary care practices, to support nurses, administrative staff, practice managers, and receptionists to work collaboratively with general practitioners (GPs) to enhance the delivery of patient care when implementing practice systems that supported chronic disease care. Sixty primary care practices, involving 1185 participants based across Australia, took part in the study. The intervention included the following activities: structured appointment systems; patient disease registers; patient recall systems with reminders; patient education; planned care; definition of roles, responsibilities and job descriptions for each professional or staff member; communication and meetings; practice billing; record keeping; and quality improvement. Before the intervention, facilitators conducted workshops with primary care staff, followed by practice visits. Staff were provided with resource manuals and workbooks for each of the different elements of the intervention. Facilitators routinely followed up practices by telephone and email. All control teams received the IPC intervention after the 12-month follow-up data collection in each intervention practice.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cheater-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheater 2005</LINK> evaluated an externally facilitated programme aimed at improving IPC by the use of a multidisciplinary audit in a secondary care setting. Twenty-two multidisciplinary teams from five acute care hospitals in the UK participated. Each team consisted of nurses and physicians, and a representative from one or more of other health professional groups (e.g. pharmacist, social worker, physiotherapist), service support staff (e.g. ward clerk, care assistant), and managers (N = 141). A range of specialties were represented. After participating in a two-day skills workshop, external facilitators facilitated five meetings over a period of six months, for each of the multidisciplinary teams randomised to the intervention group. Intervention teams were required to undertake a collaborative audit (the specific focus of these audits was not identified) and submit an audit report. Control teams provided usual care at their institution .</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Deneckere-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Deneckere 2013</LINK> evaluated an interprofessional intervention for 30 teams caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and proximal femur fracture. Seventeen intervention teams and 13 control teams based in Belgian hospitals were involved in the study (N = 581), the aim of which was to examine effects of the use of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork, in an acute care setting. The intervention involved three facilitated components. To promote IPC the intervention included: feedback on the team's performance before the implementation of care pathways; receipt of evidence-based key indicators for implementing care pathways in practice; and review and training in the development and implementation of care pathways. The teams randomised to the control group provided usual care (i.e. did not implement care pathways). The intervention teams were given nine months to implement the intervention. After this time period, a summative evaluation was performed, in which the performance on team indicators was compared between the intervention and control groups.</P>

Participants included physicians, nurses, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, case managers, or social workers (N = 464). Intervention teams received the following activities, delivered in three phases: phase 1) an off-site facilitated workshop emphasising team dynamics, problem-solving, the use of performance feedback data, and the development of action plans (specific team performance profiles with recommendations) for process improvement; phase 2) development of written action plans to address team process problems, based on discussions at the earlier workshop; and phase 3) telephone and video conference consultation on advice for implementation of action plans, and facilitation of team process skills. Control teams continued with usual care (i.e. specific team performance profile information).

Thirty-six nursing homes were randomised to either receive the intervention or were randomised to the control group (N = 1854). In the experimental nursing homes, the pharmacist in the homes helped organise team meetings that occurred approximately once a month, over a period of 12 months. The nursing home pharmacists attended two training sessions prior to, and three sessions during, the programme. The team meeting participants in the nursing homes included the pharmacist, a physician, and selected nurses and nursing assistants. All participants were encouraged to take part in the meeting discussions about the drug use of individual residents. Usual care continued to be used in the control homes. Nursing home residents' prescriptions were recorded one month before, and one month after, the 12-month intervention.</P>

Ten USA-based general surgery teams were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group (N = 29). The intervention consisted of preoperative steps: a briefing with introductions from all operating team members (surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses), a review of the patient's history, laboratory and radiographic studies, and a discussion of any unusual care circumstances. Surgeons in the intervention group received instructions on using the checklist and reminders before each surgery. In addition, a checklist copy was posted on the anaesthesia monitor in the operating room during cases, and team members were encouraged to use a call-and-repeat method to ensure that key steps of the checklist were neither omitted nor performed in a suboptimal manner. Control teams performed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure in their normal fashion, without the use of a checklist.</P>

Externally facilitated interprofessional activities may slightly improve patient functional status (1 study, N = 464) and adherence to recommended practices (2 studies, N = 722), and may improve use of resources (1 study, N = 464). There was low-certainty evidence for all outcomes. It is uncertain whether externally facilitated interprofessional activities improve patient-assessed quality of care (1 study, N = 1185), continuity of care (1 study, N = 464), or collaborative working (3 studies, N = 1907), as we graded the evidence as very low-certainty.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-08 22:31:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The included studies covered four types of practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities, interprofessional rounds, interprofessional meetings, and interprofessional checklists. We did not find any studies that used other types of practice-based IPC interventions, such as debriefing. Given the range of practice-based interventions aimed at promoting IPC, and the different types of participants, settings, and clinical areas addressed in these interventions, further studies are required to provide better insight into the effectiveness of these interventions alone or in combination, in a variety of target groups and clinical areas.</P>
<P>Other issues affected the completeness of the evidence. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK> acknowledged that their study could not provide robust evidence about the participating teams' decision-making processes, or the strategies used by pharmacists in their role as team facilitators.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes, focused on examining interprofessional collaboration processes, were not well examined in most of the studies, with only four studies reporting on this type of outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Black-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheater-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheater 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deneckere-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Deneckere 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six of the nine included studies were cluster-randomised trials; this was appropriate, given the complex nature of interventions and their inherently clustered nature, the difficulty of blinding, and the consequential threat of contamination.</P>
<P>Whilst we identified four new studies for this review, the number of practice-based IPC studies remains small. Some of the studies offered some evidence that IPC interventions may be effective in improving clinical processes/efficiency outcomes, but the small number of studies and the methodological limitations precluded definitive conclusions. Therefore, we still know little about the processes of collaboration, and how they contribute to changes in clinical process/efficiency and patient outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The review included nine randomised trials; the findings for the two comparisons are summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. Based on our GRADE assessment, we found the certainty of the evidence from the included studies to be low or very low due to risk of bias (attrition, detection, selection, reporting, and contamination bias), and potential indirectness (as outcomes generated in one country or clinical setting may not be transferable to other settings).</P>
<P>A number of other study limitations may also have contributed to the risk of bias: 
<LINK REF="STD-Curley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1998</LINK> used a non-validated survey to examine interdisciplinary communication on the ward. <LINK REF="STD-Wild-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wild 2004</LINK> used a questionnaire to ask about communication, but this was only administered to the experimental group. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Cheater-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheater 2005</LINK> used a modified Collaborative Practice Scale (CPS), which was also only completed by the experimental group. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2004</LINK> used the number of communications between health professionals, recorded in the notes, to measure communication, which is a limited measurement of collaboration. <LINK REF="STD-Deneckere-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Deneckere 2013</LINK> used a post-test only; as a result, there was no baseline assessment measured before the intervention. Also, the results were primarily based on self-reported outcomes, which caused some limitations, such as possible social desirability bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-30 06:36:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Daniela Gonçalves Bradley">
<P>The findings from the nine studies included in this review suggested that interventions aimed at improving interprofessional collaboration (IPC) through practice changes may slightly improve clinical process/efficiency and patient health outcomes compared to usual care or an alternative intervention. Nine randomised trials of four different IPC interventions, in nine different clinical settings and health conditions provided mixed results. We judged the certainty of evidence from these randomised trials to be low to very low. Based on these included studies we do not have sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-05 13:33:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the problems that health professionals encounter with IPC in their clinical practice (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_rner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Körner 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Leijen_x002d_Zeelenberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Leijen-Zeelenberg 2015</LINK>), it is encouraging that research on the effects of IPC interventions has increased since the previous Cochrane Review of this intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2009</LINK>). While this research field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. It is recommended that future randomised trials have a clear and explicit focus on IPC, longer acclimatisation periods before evaluating newly implemented teamwork interventions, and longer follow-up.</P>
<P>Future research should also focus on the conceptualisation and measurement of collaboration. While there are some scales that measure collaboration (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Kenaszchuk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenaszchuk 2010</LINK>), there are limitations with their validity, reliability, the extent to which they could be used with different professional groups, and how well they examine issues of collaborative practice.</P>
<P>The studies included in this updated Cochrane Review used a variety of terms to describe their interventions (e.g. interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary), which contributes to an on-going confusion of terminology. The absence of a consistent approach to terminology of these interventions undermines our ability to synthesise them in order to develop a more informed understanding of their effects. Further work is needed to clarify the conceptualisation of IPC, interprofessional education, and interprofessional organisationally-based interventions to support consistency in the use and understanding of these terms and their related interventions. While we have published an initial classification (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>), future empirical work could test these conceptualisations to generate more detailed knowledge related to their implementation. Finally, quantitative and qualitative methods should be used in single studies to improve our understanding of how the intervention addresses collaboration, the nature of changes that occur in relation to collaboration, and how they in turn lead to the outcomes achieved.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-05-22 06:07:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authorship changed between protocol and review updates. The title has changed from the protocol: 'The effects on patient care of interventions to change collaboration between nurses and doctors' (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 1996</LINK>). Changes were also made to criteria for included study designs, included participants, and specification of the intervention between the published protocol and this update. The protocol planned to include randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series designs, whereas the last update (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2009</LINK>) and this update included only randomised trials. The protocol planned to include only physicians and nurses, whereas this update included all types of health and social care professionals. The protocol also planned to include studies in which the interventions may not have specified their intent to change interprofessional collaboration, whereas this update included only studies with an explicit focus on collaboration. These changes were made to increase the validity of the conclusions, and to widen their applicability to professions beyond nursing and medicine.</P>
