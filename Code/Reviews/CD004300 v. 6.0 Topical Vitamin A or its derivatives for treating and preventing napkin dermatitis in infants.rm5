<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-24 11:15:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There is not enough evidence to support the use of vitamin A to treat nappy rash. Nappy or diaper rash is a term used to describe inflammation in babies' napkin area. Whilst nappy rash does not make babies very sick, it is very common and it causes varying levels of discomfort to infants and concern to parents. Ointments that contain vitamin A have been suggested as possible treatments for napkin rash. Our review found that there is not enough evidence to say whether vitamin A is effective for treating or preventing napkin rash; more research is needed. One small trial found that applying vitamin A in the first three months of life did not prevent napkin rash.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-05 11:18:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Napkin dermatitis (nappy or diaper rash) is a non-specific term used to describe inflammatory eruptions (rashes) in the napkin area. Most infants develop napkin dermatitis at least once during their infancy. Topical vitamin A has been suggested as a treatment for napkin dermatitis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if treatment with topical vitamin A is successful in either preventing napkin dermatitis, or producing resolution or decreasing the severity of napkin dermatitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (May 2005); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 3, 2005); Ovid MEDLINE from 1966 to August 2005; EMBASE (2003 to May 2005); Ovid OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); and CINAHL (1982 to August 2005). We also searched reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, where the topical application of medication containing vitamin A (or its derivatives) was compared with either placebo, no treatment or other topical medication, for the prevention or treatment of napkin dermatitis in infants aged from zero to two years.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-05 11:18:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Two authors (AJD and MWD) identified and checked titles and abstracts obtained from the searches, and reviewed the full text where necessary. They decided which trials met the inclusion criteria, and recorded their methodological quality. They assessed studies as either adequate, unclear or inadequate using the following key criteria: (a) randomisation (method of generation and concealment of allocation); (b) blinding; (c) loss to follow up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We did not find any studies for the treatment of napkin dermatitis. We found only one study comparing the use of topical application of medication containing vitamin A, with another topical medication or placebo, to prevent napkin dermatitis. This included study, of 114 newborn infants, reported no significant differences between groups with regard to the severity or duration of napkin dermatitis. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>For the treatment of napkin dermatitis there is no evidence to support or refute the use of topical vitamin A preparations. For the prevention of napkin dermatitis there is no evidence to suggest that topical vitamin A alters the development of napkin dermatitis. Further RCTs are required to determine whether topical vitamin A is efficacious in treating or preventing napkin dermatitis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Napkin dermatitis (also known as nappy rash or diaper rash) is a non-specific term used to describe inflammatory eruptions in the napkin area. Nappy rash is most commonly characterised by confluent erythema (i.e. joined patches of redness) of the convex surfaces of the buttocks, the areas of skin in closest contact with the nappy (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Most infants develop such an eruption at least once during their infancy, and napkin dermatitis is the most common cause for dermatological consultation in infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Concannon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concannon 2001</LINK>). Napkin dermatitis is most commonly seen between 6 and 12 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>The exact cause of napkin dermatitis remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>). Friction and maceration (i.e. the softening of skin by soaking) are recognised as key causative factors in the pathogenesis of napkin dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>). Increased hydration increases the risk of frictional damage and impairs the skin's barrier function, increasing its susceptibility to irritants. Increased skin wetness allows growth of micro-organisms on the surface of the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>). Friction may produce the initial breach in the protective coating of the skin. The preterm infant is more vulnerable to mechanical injury because of its thin stratum corneum, lack of dermal papillary projections and a thinner, less collagenised dermis (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>). Contact with components of urine and faeces and the contribution of micro-organisms in the napkin area have also been considered as possible causative agents in napkin dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>). Faeces contain a variety of bacteria, some of which contain urease, which releases ammonia from the urine and raises the pH (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>). Ammonia is considered a contributory cause in the aetiology of napkin dermatitis as it is only irritant when applied to a damaged stratum corneum (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>). Faeces contain other enzymes such as proteases and lipases which also irritate the skin of infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>). Faecal enzymes also increase the permeability of the skin to bile salts, which act as irritants to the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1992</LINK>). Occlusion of the skin, by means such as napkins, elevates the surface pH (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1990</LINK>). Increased urinary pH is a contributory factor in napkin dermatitis through its action in increasing the activity of irritant faecal enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2002</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-24 10:43:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Numerous treatments have been tried for napkin dermatitis, with varying success. Current treatment regimens emphasise the type of nappies used and the skin care of the napkin region (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>). It is suggested that good quality disposable napkins and frequent nappy changes may decrease the incidence of maceration and thus the incidence of nappy rash (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1998</LINK>). Specific therapies aimed at reducing the inflammation of the napkin area may also be employed. Traditional topical napkin rash treatments included topical corticosteroids used in isolation and combination preparations of anticandidal and antibacterial agents with corticosteroids. Topical vitamin A has been suggested as a possible treatment for napkin dermatitis and is contained in many preparations available for the treatment of napkin dermatitis. Vitamin A deficiency can cause skin changes and subclinical deficiency of vitamin A has been associated with increased infections (including skin) (<LINK REF="REF-Soni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soni 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Consideration must be given to potential side effects as a result of systemic absorption of topical preparations in infants and neonates. The keratinised stratum corneum is the skin's major protection against absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1986</LINK>). Keratinisation begins at 22 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Haake-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haake 1999</LINK>) and infant skin demonstrates barrier function similar to that of an adult by 32 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1988</LINK>). Barrier function of the stratum corneum develops rapidly after birth (regardless of gestation), achieving the epidermal development of the term infant at two weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1988</LINK>). The penetration of the skin is altered by site, reflecting the varying thickness of the stratum corneum (<LINK REF="REF-Shupack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupack 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The absorption of retinoic acid (an oxidized metabolite of vitamin A) through the skin is limited (approximately 2%), and is not increased despite long term administration (<LINK REF="REF-Latriano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latriano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1998</LINK>). Differing formulations of retinoic acid did not alter percutaneous absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Latriano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latriano 1997</LINK>). No rise in retinoic acid levels has been demonstrated regardless of the surface area of application (<LINK REF="REF-Latriano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latriano 1997</LINK>). Minimal percutaneous absorption of retinoic acid suggests that the adverse effects of oral retinoid therapy (e.g. teratogenicity, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal disturbances) are unlikely with topical applications. Topical application of retinoic acid has been associated with some local adverse effects (predominantly in adults for the treatment of acne). Common adverse effects of topical retinoic acid include increased solar sensitivity and local irritation, causing erythema and peeling (<LINK REF="REF-Skov-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skov 1997</LINK>).</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objectives were to determine if treatment with topical vitamin A is successful in either preventing napkin dermatitis, or producing resolution or decreasing the severity of napkin dermatitis. <BR/>
<BR/>A secondary objective was to establish if topical application of vitamin A in infants is associated with adverse outcome.</P>
<P>The protocol for this review was for treatment of napkin dermatitis with Vitamin A . Since the only study found dealt with prevention we decided (after discussion with the editors) to change the title and objectives of this review to include both treatment and prevention . All searches were re-run to reflect the new objectives.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed studies using the following key criteria:<BR/>(a) randomisation (method of generation and concealment of allocation)<BR/>(b) blinding (blinding of observers / participants to the treatment allocation)<BR/>(c) loss to follow-up (presence of drop-outs and withdrawals, and the analysis of these).<BR/>
<BR/>We categorised each component as adequate, unclear or inadequate.</P>
<P>Randomisation (allocation generation): adequate when the allocation sequence protects against biased allocation to the comparison groups</P>
<P>Randomisation (allocation concealment): adequate when the clinicians and participants are unaware of future allocations</P>
<P>Blinding: adequate when the outcome assessor is unaware of the allocation</P>
<P>Loss to follow up: adequate when more than 80% of participants are followed up, and analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention to treat).</P>

<P>One hundred and fourteen newborn infants were allocated to the use one of two creams. The control group (n = 56) received topical application of a cream with the following ingredients: Lassar's plain zinc paste 30 grams, lanolin 20 grams, petrolatum 10 grams. The study group (n = 58) received topical application of a cream with the following ingredients: Lassar's plain zinc paste 30 grams, lanolin 20 grams, petrolatum 10 grams, vitamin A ester palminate 1000 IU/gram. The two creams were indistinguishable (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch_x002d_Banyeras-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch-Banyeras 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Upon discharge from hospital after the birth of their child, mothers were advised to apply the cream when changing diapers and to clean the diaper area with a moist sea-sponge. Infants were examined every 15 days for 6 follow-up visits. At each visit they were assessed for the presence or absence of diaper rash. Diaper rash severity was graded as follows: <BR/>0 = absence of diaper rash; <BR/>1 = minimal, no contiguous spotty erythema and no swelling; <BR/>2 = slight, rather contiguous erythema and slight evidence of swelling; <BR/>3 = moderate continuous erythema and swelling, and lesions present; <BR/>4 = severe erythema and swelling with multiple lesions and excoriated areas.</P>
<P>Infants were excluded from the study if other topical or systemic medication were prescribed for the rash. The control and treatment groups were similar in terms of frequency of diaper change and bowel motions. There was also no reported difference in the percentage of breastfed infants in either intervention group. One infant in the study group was excluded because the paediatrician had prescribed topical and systemic medication for napkin rash.</P>

<P>We found one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch_x002d_Banyeras-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch-Banyeras 1988</LINK>) comparing the use of topical application of medication containing vitamin A with another topical medication.</P>
<P>The single included study (<LINK REF="STD-Bosch_x002d_Banyeras-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch-Banyeras 1988</LINK>) of the use of Vitamin A containing cream for the prevention of napkin dermatitis reported that there were no significant differences between groups with regard to the severity or duration of napkin dermatitis. The trial authors reported the frequency distribution for mean rash scores over all six follow-up visits and the frequency distribution of the number of visits at which they had any rash. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for reproductions of the tables from <LINK REF="STD-Bosch_x002d_Banyeras-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bosch-Banyeras 1988</LINK>. Our specific outcome 'the number of infants with any rash' was not reported. None of the following relevant outcomes were included in this study: number of infants with any rash; duration of napkin dermatitis; serum vitamin A levels; number of infants with clinical signs of vitamin A toxicity. Therefore, there are no quantitative data available on any outcomes that we considered relevant.</P>

<P>There is no information available from RCTs on the efficacy of vitamin A for the treatment of napkin dermatitis.</P>
<P>There is one small, poorly reported, RCT on the use of vitamin A containing cream for preventing napkin dermatitis. This study was randomised and its major strength is that the two creams used in the study (one with and one without vitamin A) were indistinguishable, allowing adequate blinding of the treatment for both caregivers and investigators. The group allocation was adequately concealed. One hundred and fourteen infants were studied and they were only followed up for 3 months: napkin dermatitis is most commonly seen between 6 and 12 months of age. Nevertheless, the trial authors report that the incidence and severity of napkin dermatitis did not differ between groups. Given the population studied there is no information on differences with regard to the gestational age of the infant. There was also no assessment of systemic side effects or the relative efficacy of ointments versus creams.</P>
<P>We can only speculate on the reasons for the dearth of studies using topical vitamin A to prevent or treat napkin dermatitis. It may well be because of the perceived lack of adverse effects of topical vitamin A. This of course ignores the cost of such treatments and the false reassurance given to parents of affected infants.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>There is no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin A for the prevention or treatment of napkin dermatitis.</LI>
<LI>The review found only one single, small, poorly-reported RCT of topical vitamin A which showed no alteration in the development of napkin dermatitis in the first three months of life. </LI>
<LI>For treatment of napkin dermatitis: there is no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin A for the treatment of napkin dermatitis.</LI>
<LI>For prevention of napkin dermatitis: there is no evidence to suggest that topical vitamin A alters the development of napkin dermatitis given that there is only one single, small, poorly-reported RCT of topical vitamin A which showed no alteration in the development of napkin dermatitis in the first three months of life. Given the available data, the usage of preparations containing vitamin A for the prevention of napkin dermatitis cannot be recommended. </LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further RCTs are required to determine whether topical vitamin A is efficacious in preventing or treating napkin dermatitis. These studies should also determine if there is any systemic toxicity associated with topical vitamin A application in infants. The relative efficacy of vitamin A derivatives in cream and ointment base should also be considered.<I>
