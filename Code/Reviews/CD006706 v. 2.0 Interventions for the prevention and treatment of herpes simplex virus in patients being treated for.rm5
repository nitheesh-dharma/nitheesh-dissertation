<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:57:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective, but associated with oral complications such as mucositis, fungal infections, bacterial infections and viral infections such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Oral complications can impact severely on quality of life and may lead to life-threatening systemic infection. Infection with HSV can cause pain and blistering on or around the lips and within the mouth. Orofacial lesions are most commonly caused by HSV type 1. Aciclovir and other antiviral drugs such as valaciclovir, famiciclovir and penciclovir, have been widely used to treat HSV-related conditions. Recurrent HSV type 1 infection in patients who are immunocompromised due to treatment for cancer may be more aggressive, painful and slower to heal. These more extensive lesions often require much longer treatment and leave the patient more susceptible to developing drug-resistant strains of HSV. This review of 17 trials found evidence that aciclovir is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of HSV infections, in terms of preventing clinical/culture positive HSV infections, reduction in healing time, duration of viral shedding and relief of pain. There is no evidence that valaciclovir is more efficacious than aciclovir, or that a high dose of valaciclovir is better than a low dose of valaciclovir. There is evidence that for prevention, placebo is more efficacious than prostaglandin E. However, in all included trials, risk of bias is unclear. No trials reported on duration of hospital stay, amount of analgesia or patient quality of life.</P>

<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, SIGLE and LILACS. The reference list of all related review articles and articles considered to be potentially relevant were checked for further trials. Authors of identified trials and known specialists in the field were also contacted in an attempt to identify any additional published or unpublished trials.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:40:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing interventions for the prevention or treatment or both of HSV infection in people being treated for cancer. Outcomes were presence/absence of clinical/culture positive HSV infections (prevention), time to complete healing of lesions (treatment), duration of viral shedding, recurrence of lesions, relief of pain, amount of analgesia, duration of hospital stay, cost of oral care, patient quality of life and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:41:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and sample demographics where necessary. Quality assessment was carried out on randomisation, blindness, withdrawals and selective reporting. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratio (RR) values were calculated using random-effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:53:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. Four trials evaluated preventative interventions for HSV lesions, three trials for viral isolates, and eight trials evaluated both outcome measures. A single trial reported on the cost of prophylaxis for HSV. Two trials evaluating treatment reported on time to healing, duration of viral shedding and relief of pain. No trials reported on duration of hospital stay, amount of analgesia or patient quality of life.</P>
<P>In placebo controlled trials, aciclovir was found to be effective for the prevention of HSV infections as measured by oral lesions or viral isolates (RR = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.31 nine trials; RR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.37 nine trials). There is no evidence that valaciclovir is more efficacious than aciclovir, or that higher doses of valaciclovir are more effective than lower doses. Placebo was found to be more effective than prostaglandin E for prevention of viral isolates (RR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.14 one trial).</P>
<P>Aciclovir was also found to be effective for the treatment of HSV in terms of duration of viral shedding (median of 2.5 days versus 17.0 days, P = 0.0002; 2 days compared to more than 9, P = 0.0008), time to first decrease in pain (median 3 days compared to 16, P = 0.04), complete resolution of pain (9.9 days compared to 13.6 days, P = 0.01; median of 6 days compared to 16, P = 0.05), 50% healing (median of 6 days compared to 11, P = 0.01) and total healing (median 13.9 days compared to 20.7 days, P = 0.08; median of 8 days compared to 21, P = 0.0).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that aciclovir is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. There is no evidence that valaciclovir is more efficacious than aciclovir, or that a high dose of valaciclovir is better than a low dose of valaciclovir.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-06 12:01:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral complications occurring during and following cancer treatment are common and can cause pain, difficulty in swallowing and phonation and poor nutrition. They clearly can impact severely on a patient's quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1999</LINK>) and may lead to life-threatening systemic infection. Oral complications include mucositis, fungal infections, bacterial infections and viral infections such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV).</P>
<P>Infection with HSV can cause pain and blistering on or around the lips and within the mouth. Orofacial lesions are most commonly caused by HSV type 1, although not exclusively. It is estimated that around 80% of the population are asymptomatic carriers of the virus (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2003</LINK>). Following primary infection, which may be asymptomatic, the virus enters sensory nerve endings and travels up the axon and becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion. The virus can lie dormant for many years until triggered by a stimulus such as sunlight, stress, common cold, febrile illnesses, menstruation or immunosuppression. The activation of the virus under conditions of immunosuppression can lead to severe oral and occasionally, disseminated infections. Recurrent HSV type 1 infection in immunocompromised patients may be more aggressive, painful and slower to heal than in the immunocompetent patient (<LINK REF="REF-Arduino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arduino 2006</LINK>). It is thought that approximately 50% to 90% of bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients who are seropositive for HSV will develop HSV infections, usually within the first 5 weeks after transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1989</LINK>). A large proportion of patients with acute leukaemia or those receiving high dose chemotherapy will reactivate HSV during periods of immunosuppression.</P>
<P>Aciclovir, a specific nucleoside inhibitor of the herpes DNA polymerase, has been widely used to treat HSV-related conditions since its development in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Arduino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arduino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmid_x002d_Wendtner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmid-Wendtner 2004</LINK>). However, more recently, a greater understanding of the replication of HSV has led to the development of new antiviral compounds such as valaciclovir, famiciclovir and penciclovir. These newer drugs are gaining attention due to increased bioavailability and reduced frequency of dosing.</P>
<P>There are also important considerations relating to resistance to antiherpetic drugs that need to be considered when treating immunocompromised patients. In patients who are immunocompetent, recurrent HSV lesions are usually small and short lived and resistance to antiherpetic drugs is rarely an issue (<LINK REF="REF-Chilukuri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilukuri 2003</LINK>). However, the slower healing, more extensive lesions occurring in immunocompromised patients often require much longer treatment and leave the patient more susceptible to developing drug-resistant strains of HSV, requiring the development of regimens for both receptive and refractory HSV infections (<LINK REF="REF-Arduino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arduino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chilukuri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilukuri 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review aims to examine the effects of different preventative and treatment strategies for managing HSV in patients who are immunocompromised due to treatment for cancer.<BR/>

<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two of the review's authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently by the review authors to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed for quality and data extracted.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two of the review's authors independently using a specially designed data extraction form. The characteristics of the trial participants, interventions and outcomes for all included trials were recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The quality assessment of included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two of the review's authors as part of the data extraction process in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Included trials were assessed on the following criteria:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>generation of random sequence</LI>
<LI>concealed allocation of treatment</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants/caregivers</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessors</LI>
<LI>extent of drop outs/exclusions (trials using an intention-to-treat analysis were noted)</LI>
<LI>selective reporting.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A description of the quality items was tabulated for each included trial, along with a judgement of low, high or uncertain risk of bias. Criteria for risk of bias judgements regarding allocation concealment are given below as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias - adequate concealment of the allocation (e.g. sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias - uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (e.g. where the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias - inadequate allocation concealment (e.g. open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, date of birth, or case record number).</LI>
</UL>
<P>A summary assessment of the risk of bias for the primary outcome (across domains) for both prevention and treatment within and across studies was undertaken <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Within a study, a summary assessment of low risk of bias was given when there was a low risk of bias for all key domains, unclear risk of bias when there was an unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains, and high risk of bias when there was a high risk of bias for one or more key domains. Across studies, a summary assessment was rated as low risk of bias when most information was from studies at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias when most information was from studies at low or unclear risk of bias, and high risk of bias when the proportion of information was from studies at high risk of bias sufficient to affect the interpretation of the results.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, for example the presence/absence of culture positive HSV infections, the estimates of effect of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated where means and standard deviations are presented or were calculable.</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by examining the participants and cancer types, interventions and outcome measures included in the trials. Meta-analyses were only carried out if trials were of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. Estimates of effect were combined using a random-effects model. The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and quantified by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. It was planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of individual quality items, publication status and language of publication on the overall estimates of effect. However there were insufficient data to do this.</P>
<P>It was proposed a priori to undertake subgroup analyses for different cancer types (leukaemia, solid tumours and mixed), cancer treatment (for example, bone marrow transplantation) and age groups (children, adults and both). Sufficient data were available for subgroup analyses by age group only. A decision to undertake subgroup analyses according to mode of delivery of pharmacological intervention was made post hoc.<BR/>

<P>The search resulted in only three interventions: aciclovir, valaciclovir and prostaglandin E, for the prevention or treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV). In the placebo controlled trials, aciclovir was found to be effective for prevention and treatment. In comparisons of active interventions, there is no evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between valaciclovir and aciclovir, or higher doses of valaciclovir and lower doses. Where adverse effects were reported for the aciclovir or valaciclovir interventions, these were evenly distributed amongst the placebo and active intervention groups. In the single study assessing the effectiveness of prostaglandin E for prevention, this intervention was less effective than placebo. No adverse effects were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>There were sufficient data to compare the efficacy of placebo-controlled aciclovir studies by mode of administration and patient age group. There is evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between aciclovir administered orally or intravenously and placebo for prevention measured by oral lesions. Whilst there is evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between aciclovir administered orally and placebo for prevention measured by viral isolates, there is no evidence of a significant difference in efficacy for aciclovir administered intravenously. The benefit of aciclovir was present for studies comprising children and adults as well as adults alone. A potential limitation to the review is that all but one of the studies comprised patients with cancer of the blood, and there were insufficient data to carry out analyses with respect to cancer treatment. Reporting of the primary outcomes identified in this review of clinical/viral isolates and time to healing was good, but reporting of the secondary outcomes was variable from trial to trial. Furthermore there were little patient-reported outcomes or economic data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The findings should be interpreted with caution with respect to the research objective. Although 17 trials were included, the methodological assessment indicated that the overall risk of bias was unclear in all studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential bias</HEADING>
<P>Not all relevant data could be obtained and some potentially relevant trials were excluded. Presentation of results for 'immunocompromised' patients, rather than by clinical condition meant that some potentially relevant trials could not be included in the review. Attempts to obtain further information for these trials from the authors were not successful. Information to enable a methodological assessment was also lacking for many of the trials, and can perhaps be attributed to the date of publication. The CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>) was first introduced in 1996, and of 17 studies included in this review 14 pre-date the introduction of the statement.</P>
<P>Whilst there were too few trials to formally determine whether publication bias was present, published trials showing no evidence of the effect of aciclovir versus placebo were included.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-06 16:37:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias in the studies included in this review is uncertain. For the primary outcome of the prophylaxis studies of presence or absence of clinical/culture positive herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, a within study summary assessment of uncertain risk of bias was given to 11 studies, low risk of bias to two studies, and high risk of bias for the two 'non-blinded' studies. Across studies, a summary assessment was rated as unclear risk of bias. For the primary outcome of the treatment studies of time to healing of HSV infections, a within study summary assessment of uncertain risk of bias was given. Across the two studies, as most information was from studies at low or unclear risk of bias, a summary assessment was rated as unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>There is evidence that aciclovir may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. There is weak evidence that valaciclovir is as effective as aciclovir though this is based on only two trials. As a prophylaxis, placebo is more effective than prostaglandin E (one trial).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:57:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the risk of bias cannot be ascertained for the majority of studies included in this review, principally through lack of information to enable a judgement to be made, there is a need for more, well defined trials assessing the effectiveness of aciclovir and valaciclovir for the prevention and treatment of HSV infections in patients receiving treatment for cancer. Further research into prevention and treatment with patients of other cancer types and cancer treatments would enhance the evidence base. Better reporting of studies, particularly the stratification of results of 'immunocompromised' patients into their underlying condition and treatment, and the additional inclusion of non-clinical outcome measures such as patient reported outcomes and economic evaluations are also warranted.
