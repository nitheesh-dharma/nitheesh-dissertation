<TITLE>Traditional birth attendant training for improving health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional birth attendants are important providers of maternity care in developing countries. Many women in those countries give birth at home, assisted by family members or traditional birth attendants (TBAs). TBAs lack formal training and their skills are initially acquired by delivering babies and apprenticeships with other TBAs. Governments and other organisations have conducted training programmes to improve their skills and to link TBAs to health services. There is disagreement about whether these training programmes are effective. This review included six studies involving over 1345 TBAs, more than 32,000 women and approximately 57,000 births and examined the effect of TBA training, or additional training, on TBA behaviour and on pregnancy outcomes. We conclude that while there are a few more studies meeting the inclusion criteria and the results are promising for some outcomes, more evidence is needed to establish the potential of TBA training to improve peri-neonatal mortality. A lack of contrast in training in the intervention and control clusters and an insufficient number of studies may have contributed to the lack of observed differences in maternal deaths and deaths of their babies (early neonatal deaths).</P>

<P>Six studies involving over 1345 TBAs, more than 32,000 women and approximately 57,000 births that examined the effects of TBA training for trained versus untrained TBAs (one study) and additionally trained TBA training versus trained TBAs (five studies) are included in this review. These studies consist of individual randomised trials (two studies) and cluster-randomised trials (four studies). The primary outcomes across the sample of studies were perinatal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths (early, late and overall).</P>
<P>Trained TBAs versus untrained TBAs: one cluster-randomised trial found a significantly lower perinatal death rate in the trained versus untrained TBA clusters (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.83), lower stillbirth rate (adjusted OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) and lower neonatal death rate (adjusted OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.82). This study also found the maternal death rate was lower but not significant (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.22).</P>
<P>Additionally trained TBAs versus trained TBAs: three large cluster-randomised trials compared TBAs who received additional training in initial steps of resuscitation, including bag-valve-mask ventilation, with TBAs who had received basic training in safe, clean delivery and immediate newborn care. Basic training included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (two studies) or bag-valve-mask resuscitation (one study). There was no significant difference in the perinatal death rate between the intervention and control clusters (one study, adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02) and no significant difference in late neonatal death rate between intervention and control clusters (one study, adjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.11). The neonatal death rate, however, was 45% lower in intervention compared with the control clusters (one study, 22.8% versus 40.2%, adjusted RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92).</P>
<P>We conducted a meta-analysis on two outcomes: stillbirths and early neonatal death. There was no significant difference between the additionally trained TBAs versus trained TBAs for stillbirths (two studies, mean weighted adjusted RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28) or early neonatal death rate (three studies, mean weighted adjusted RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01). </P>

<P>The results are promising for some outcomes (perinatal death, stillbirth and neonatal death). However, most outcomes are reported in only one study. A lack of contrast in training in the intervention and control clusters may have contributed to the null result for stillbirths and an insufficient number of studies may have contributed to the failure to achieve significance for early neonatal deaths. Despite the additional studies included in this updated systematic review, there remains insufficient evidence to establish the potential of TBA training to improve peri-neonatal mortality.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:49:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) defines a traditional birth attendant (TBA) as a person who assists the mother during childbirth and who initially acquires skills by delivering babies herself or through an apprenticeship to other TBAs. Individual TBAs and their roles vary. However, certain characteristics are commonly seen across continents and regions (<LINK REF="REF-Fortney-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortney 1997a</LINK>). TBAs tend to be older women, respected in the community for their knowledge and experience. They are often non-literate and have learned their skills through older, more experienced TBAs. They may work independently, in collaboration with an individual provider or facility or they may be integrated into the health system. Their role may include, in addition to birth attendance, bathing and massage, domestic chores and provision of care during the later postpartum or postnatal period. TBAs may perform other roles depending on local custom, their own interests and expertise. The number of births TBAs attend each year ranges from a few births to as many as 120 births per year. Typically, TBAs attract clients by reputation and word-of-mouth. Usually they receive some remuneration for their services. </P>
<P>TBAs are important providers of maternity care in developing countries. Analysis of the 1995 to 1999 Demographic Health Surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Measure-DHS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Measure DHS 2002</LINK>) using STATCompiler found that TBAs (trained and untrained) assisted at 24% of 200,633 live births (ranging from less than 1% to 66%) in 44 developing countries representing five regions of the world. Reporting on attendance at birth does not clearly distinguish between a TBA, a family TBA (one who has been designated by an extended family to attend births only in that family) or a relative who occasionally attends birth. When these categories are combined, TBAs, relatives and others assisted at 43% of all live births, ranging from less than 1% to 89% of live births. Up to 12% of births are unassisted in some settings (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004a</LINK>). Our re-analysis of the 2005 to 2009 Demographic and Health Surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Measure-DHS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Measure DHS 2011</LINK>) using STATCompiler for 20 sub-Saharan African countries shows that 42% of births from 2002 to 2006 were attended by semi- or unskilled attendants (TBAs and relatives/others attend 26% and 17% of births, respectively, while 6% of births were unattended). These statistics are similar for five South Asian countries, where 53% of births are attended by unskilled or semi-skilled attendants (TBAs attend 23% of births, relatives/others 28% and 2% are unattended).  </P>
<P>Maternal mortality estimates for 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>) indicated that approximately 536,000 women die each year from causes related to childbearing; 99% in developing countries, mostly due to direct obstetric causes including severe bleeding (haemorrhage), infection, complications of unsafe abortion, eclampsia and obstructed labour (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>). Although more recent estimates show that a number of countries have made progress and are on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia together still carry the greatest burden of death, with 87% of maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). </P>
<P>An estimated 4 million babies die within four weeks of birth, mostly (75%) within the first week and on the first day of life; a similar number of babies are stillborn. Like maternal mortality, 99% of neonatal deaths take place in developing countries, mostly due to preterm birth, severe infections and asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Although progress has been made towards MDG 4 to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, this is primarily due to reductions in child mortality. To achieve MDG 4, reductions in neonatal mortality are also necessary. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. Most countries in these regions have made little progress in reducing these deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Stillbirths and early neonatal deaths have similar obstetric origins and could be largely prevented, highlighting the importance of skilled care during labour, delivery and the early postnatal period for both mothers and babies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>During the 1970s through to the 1990s, the World Health Organization promoted training of TBAs as a major public health strategy to reduce this tragic and preventable loss of life. According to the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), a trained TBA is any TBA who has received a short course of training through the modern health sector to upgrade skills. The broad goals of TBA training were to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality and to improve the reproductive health of women. Objectives included enhancing linkages between modern healthcare services and the community, increasing the number of TBA-attended births, and improving TBA skills and stature. Training programmes differed considerably in the way in which they address these objectives (<LINK REF="REF-Fortney-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortney 1997a</LINK>). TBAs were trained by individuals, non-governmental organisations and missions, as well as by local, state and national governments. The training programmes ranged from very basic to quite elaborate and may last from several days to several months. They may, but often did not, include clinical practice at a referral facility. They may, but sometimes did not, include continued contact with trained TBAs through supervision and further education. The content of TBA training also varied but usually includes performance of hygienic deliveries and cord care and use of appropriate techniques for delivery of the placenta to prevent immediate postpartum haemorrhage. Consistent with the emphasis on extending the reach of primary health care, however, many TBAs were also trained to take on expanded functions focusing on prevention, screening and referral. Usually TBAs were not trained to provide initial management for major maternal and neonatal complications such as postpartum haemorrhage or birth asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004c</LINK>). Moreover, TBAs typically practised in resource-poor environments where access to and availability of quality emergency obstetric care are severely constrained. Thus, their ability to impact maternal and neonatal mortality was limited. After more than three decades of experience, the evidence to support TBA training was limited and conflicting. By the late 1990s the uncertain impact of TBAs on maternal and neonatal mortality stimulated a passionate policy debate over the cost-effectiveness of TBA training (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortney-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortney 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levitt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levitt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maine 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maine 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Starrs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starrs 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tinker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinker 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Since the mid-1990s, international policy has promoted skilled birth attendance. At the same time, countries with the highest maternal and neonatal mortality are often challenged by maternal and neonatal health workforce shortages, poor performance, inequitable distribution and high costs. These countries have, perhaps by default, a greater proportion of births attended by TBAs, relatives and others. While recognising the critical importance of skilled birth attendance in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, concern persists among policy makers and planners about what to do about TBAs (and other less skilled health workers) during the transition to skilled birth attendance. </P>
<P>Rigorous evaluation of TBA training is methodologically and logistically challenging. The distinction between a trained TBA and an untrained TBA may be blurred because untrained TBAs are exposed frequently to biomedical concepts and practices. Moreover, TBA training is often one component of comprehensive interventions, for example, community mobilisation and upgrading of referral facilities. Both behavioural and health outcomes such as maternal and neonatal morbidity are typically based on self report and suffer the limitations of this method (<LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortney-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortney 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ronsmans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronsmans 1997</LINK>). Finally, measuring the magnitude of the impact of TBA training on maternal mortality requires special studies with large bio-statistical denominators. As a result, while donors, governments and non-governmental organisations have invested heavily in TBA training programmes over the years, they have not invested equally in the systematic evaluation of training effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Fortney-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortney 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the review authors (LM Sibley, TA Sipe) conducted a meta-analysis for the period 1970 to 1999 on the effect of TBA training and a subsequent update through 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004c</LINK>). The original systematic review included 60 eligible studies measuring 1695 unique outcomes reflecting attributes of knowledge, attitude, behaviour and advice (a subset of behaviour) related to maternal and child health care (MCH), as well as maternal and perinatal mortality. The studies span 30 years and three world regions. Main findings include moderate to large, positive effects for MCH knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and advice associated with training and small effects associated with perinatal health outcomes, such as cause-specific neonatal mortality due to birth asphyxia, which demonstrated an 11% decrease over the untrained TBA baseline). The data were not sufficient to document an association between training and maternal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004c</LINK>). The 2004 updated systematic review (n = 16) included a stratified analysis to examine the influence of methodological variables and outcomes pertaining to antenatal care service (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004a</LINK>) and emergency obstetric care (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004b</LINK>). Main findings from the systematic review include a medium, positive, but non-significant association between training and knowledge of risk factors and health conditions requiring referral (danger signs); with small, positive, significant associations between training and TBA referral behaviour (a 36% increase over the untrained TBA baseline), as well as maternal service use (a 22% increase over the untrained TBA baseline). These findings suggest that the real effects of TBA training on TBA and maternal referral behaviour are likely to be small, and emphasise the complexity of the referral process (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004b</LINK>). Unfortunately, the overall quality of studies included in this systematic review did not permit causal attribution to training. Even in the more rigorous studies, TBA training was part of an integrated package of interventions in an integrated package of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004c</LINK>). Thus, countries that are considering current and future TBA training do not have adequate evidence needed to guide sound policy and programme decisions. As others have persuasively argued (<LINK REF="REF-Buekens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buekens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>), rigorous evaluation is both necessary and feasible. Our original and first update of this review (2007, 2009) included four studies. We concluded that the potential of TBA training to reduce peri-neonatal mortality is promising when combined with improved health services. However, the number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria was insufficient to provide the evidence needed to establish training effectiveness. </P>
<P>Responsive to the reality that lay health workers and TBAs continue to provide maternal and neonatal health in high mortality countries, the WHO has initiated consultative steps towards developing guidance for Member States on optimising the roles and capacity of frontline workers (including lay health workers and TBAs) as a possible strategy for scaling-up implementation of evidence-based care practices to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). With the addition of three new large cluster-randomised trials, we hope that this 2011 update review on TBA training effectiveness will contribute evidence that is needed for guidance on TBA training.</P>

<P>Three review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion. In addition we used items specific for cluster-randomised trials when appropriate (see <I>Handbook</I> sections 16.3.2 and 16.4.3). In the following section, we describe the criteria used to assess risk of bias for the different types of study designs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">A. Individually randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g., random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g., odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g., telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding (checking for possible detection and performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed data as low risk if there was no more than 20% missing data. Where sufficient information was reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Selective reporting bias (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">B. Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Recruitment bias</HEADING>
<P>Recruitment bias can occur when individuals are recruited to the trial after the clusters have been randomised, as the knowledge of whether each cluster is an &#8216;intervention&#8217; or &#8216;control&#8217; cluster could affect the types of participants recruited. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Baseline imbalance</HEADING>
<P>Cluster-randomised trials often randomise all clusters at once, so lack of concealment of an allocation sequence should not usually be an issue. However, because small numbers of clusters are randomised, there is a possibility of chance baseline imbalance between the randomised groups, in terms of either the clusters or the individuals. Baseline differences can be reduced by using stratified or pair-matched randomisation of clusters or statistical adjustment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (comparable groups in terms of clusters individuals or statistical adjustment in the analysis);</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Loss of clusters</HEADING>
<P>Occasionally complete clusters are lost from a trial, and have to be omitted from the analysis. Just as for missing outcome data in individually randomised trials, this may lead to bias. Missing outcomes for individuals within clusters may also lead to a risk of bias in cluster-randomised trials. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (no loss of clusters, &lt; 20% loss of individuals, &lt; 20% missing data on primary outcomes);</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Incorrect statistical methods (unit of analysis error)</HEADING>
<P>Cluster-randomised trials are sometimes analysed by incorrect statistical methods, not taking the clustering into account. Such analyses create a &#8216;unit of analysis error&#8217; and produce over-precise results (the standard error of the estimated intervention effect is too small) and P values that are too small. They do not lead to biased estimates of effect. However, if they remain uncorrected, they will receive too much weight in a meta-analysis. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">C. Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) for individually randomised trials and (1) to (4) for cluster-randomised controlled trials, above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<P>Participants included traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and lactating mothers living in the intervention and control areas (<LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>), pregnant women living in the intervention and control clusters identified, recruited and followed through the postpartum and/or postnatal periods (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>), and women recently delivered by and/or referred to a health facility by TBAs (<LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>). <I>See</I> 'Characteristics of TBAs' (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and 'Characteristics of women' (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) for available social and demographic information about the study populations.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In two studies, the authors categorised TBAs targeted by interventions as 'untrained' TBAs (<LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>). However, in one of these studies, the large majority of TBAs in both the intervention and control groups had received some prior biomedical training through government or non-governmental organisations, or both; for example, 97% of the intervention group TBAs and 70% of the control group TBAs in the Bangladesh study (<LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>) had received prior training. Thus we categorised this study into the additionally trained TBAs versus trained TBAs. In the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK>), all TBAs received some prior biomedical training (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>
<P>In four studies, the interventions consisted of educational instruction in management of normal delivery, timely detection and referral of women and/or newborns with complications, as well as importance of linking women to essential obstetric care services (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some of the studies, TBA training was part of a package of interventions including community and improved facility-based care components. For example, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>), the improvements involved staff training in essential and emergency obstetric care and clinical outreach by team physicians. Two study interventions focused on breastfeeding: one highlighted initiation of early exclusive breastfeeding and the introduction of weaning foods (<LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>), while the other intervention emphasised initiation of early suckling before placental delivery to reduce postpartum blood loss (<LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK>). Finally, the interventions in the three new studies included in this 2011 review (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>) focused on essential newborn care and resuscitation. </P>
<P>Duration of training among studies ranged from two to three days (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>) to up to one week (<LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> reported that project data collectors were not blinded to the intervention status of the TBAs, but that the TBAs, who measured blood loss, were not informed that they were participating in a trial. <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK> did not report on blinding of providers, recipients of care or outcome assessors. The risk of performance and detection bias is therefore high for <LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> and unclear for <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants and personnel is often not possible for cluster-randomised trials. Performance bias may be an issue as increased training of TBAs may have instilled greater confidence and adherence from community members for all aspects of care. <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> all used TBAs as the primary outcome assessors, with verification of data provided by other unblinded government health workers or interviewers. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> provided a 60 Taka incentive to TBAs for accurate birth/death identification, regardless of whether the TBA was the delivery attendant. However TBAs may have still underreported deaths for deliveries they attended if greater social or reputation disincentives prevailed. <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> both used prospective monitoring of pregnant women, which likely reduced detection bias of deaths. <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> also utilised a panel of independent neonatologists, blinded to group allocation, which reviewed delivery and verbal autopsy reports for stillbirths and neonatal deaths. <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> also notes that the Lady Health Workers and TBAs were not made aware of the purpose or comparative nature of the study. We consider the risk of bias due to lack of blinding for all four cluster-randomised trials to be high.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> reported that about 30% of TBAs in each group, intervention and control, were excluded from the analysis because they were "untrainable", "failed quality control check", or were "strongly suspected of fabricating results" (page 524). Among the remaining TBAs, outcomes were reported for more than 90% of women. <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK> reported outcomes for more than 90% of participants. We consider risk of attrition bias to be high for <LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> and low for <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>None of the four cluster-randomised control trials had clusters lost to follow-up. Additionally, all studies reported results for all primary outcomes listed, with a high and comparable percentage for control and intervention clusters (above 80% in all studies). In <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> only home deliveries were included in the analysis, which is appropriate due to the nature of the intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed for all primary and secondary mortality outcomes, yet analysis for behavioural secondary outcomes excluded temporary and tea garden residents. As the only specified outcome for the TBA intervention was early neonatal mortality, there is a low risk of incomplete outcome data. <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK> excluded births for which the birth weight was unmeasured from the analysis (5.1%), and reported that results were &#8220;materially unchanged&#8221; with this exclusion.</P>

</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> stated that randomisation may be compromised due to the purposive selection of districts, sampling stratification and the restricted number of clusters. Confounding with a women&#8217;s group intervention and potentially differential interventions for health services inputs may have also occurred. Underlying secular trends in declining mortality also appeared to be present in control areas. <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK> reported that participation appeared to be non-differential between intervention and control. <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> described various methods for combating misclassification of failed resuscitation as stillbirths. <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> was not sufficiently powered to detect a difference for the maternal mortality outcome. Furthermore, as the outcomes of referrals were not followed, it is possible that the intervention could have altered the composition of referred women (i.e., a greater proportion of high-risk women electing to be referred), which could have biased results. Finally, the validity of self report of maternal complications may lead to bias.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> used a factorial design in which clusters were first randomised for a women&#8217;s group intervention, then secondarily for the TBA intervention. Women were recruited after the clusters were randomised, placing it at high risk of recruitment bias. <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> was also at a high risk of bias as seven TBAs (&#8220;clusters&#8221;) were added to the control group after randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>  and <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> all had an unclear risk of recruitment bias.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Baseline imbalance</HEADING>
<P>All four studies performed a baseline survey and all but <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> controlled for baseline differences in the analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>, chance inclusion of three tea garden estates in control clusters, which &#8220;had substantially worse health and socioeconomic indicators than did the rest of the study area&#8221; occurred, and delayed surveillance activities. The baseline survey found that intervention group mothers were more likely to be younger, have no education and no household assets than control mothers. While baseline differences were adjusted for in the women&#8217;s group component of the study, it was unclear whether these differences persisted, or were controlled for, through the second-level of randomisation for the TBA component of the study. Furthermore, the <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> baseline survey collected data on a limited number of covariates and the comparability of clusters remained unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> had comprehensive baseline surveys and large numbers of clusters, thus the risk of baseline imbalance for both was low.</P>

<P>All four studies adjusted for clustering using appropriate methods and are thus at low risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Comparability with individual trials</HEADING>
<P>Of the four cluster trials, <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> had a high risk of bias for comparability with individual trials due to apparent contamination of participants from control to intervention clusters. <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> uniquely defined a cluster by TBA, versus by administrative units like districts. Intervention group TBA catchment areas often overlapped with control group TBA areas, and intervention TBAs attended significantly larger number of deliveries, a figure which increased over the course of the study. Contamination did not appear to be the case for the other studies. However the use of clusters may facilitate natural diffusion of TBA training messages and foster an environment for changes in community-level knowledge, attitudes and practices. The use of governmental administration units (e.g., sub-districts) as clusters could also promote cohesion across health system actors and strengthen referral systems. The multiple components of the TBA intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> seemed particularly aimed at these goals. The implications of these cluster-level activities made comparability with individual trials unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">C. Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment is generally not a problem for cluster-randomised control trials as all clusters are randomised at once. However, some authors did not clearly state details for allocation or randomisation sequence, prohibiting judgement on the expected direction and magnitude of the bias.</P>
<P>Lack of blinding of personnel, participants and outcome assessors was problematic across all studies, largely due to the nature of the intervention. This may have resulted in performance bias and detection bias. However, as most of the performance bias expected is due to TBA and communities&#8217; increased confidence in care provided due to the training intervention, this could arguably be considered a valid component of the intervention effect intended. Additionally, it is unclear that detection bias would have been differential between intervention and control clusters. Furthermore the direction of bias could have favoured the control groups, as better-trained TBAs in intervention clusters may have been able to more accurately detect maternal deaths. Conversely, knowledge of the intervention may have favoured the intervention group, especially for more subjective secondary outcomes such as maternal morbidity or behaviours. Prospective monitoring of pregnant women to minimise issues of disclosure of deaths by both women and TBAs is recommended, as is supervision of TBAs for data collection and follow-up.</P>
<P>Overall, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting did not appear to be problematic, neither did loss of clusters or incorrect analysis. The largest threat to comparability with individually randomised trials was concerns of a &#8220;herd effect&#8221; due to natural diffusion of education amongst mothers within intervention clusters and contamination of control cluster participants to intervention clusters due to knowledge of the intervention (also an issue for recruitment bias). The former would overestimate the effect, while the latter may underestimate the effect.</P>
<P>Baseline imbalance was addressed in some way by all four cluster-RCTs. However, a small number of clusters or incomplete baseline data proved problematic for two studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> the direction and magnitude of bias due to baseline differences is unclear, as insufficient data on these differences were collected. In <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> it is unclear in which direction baseline differences may have influenced the effect size, as it was not clear if the authors measured or controlled for these differences during the second level of randomisation for the TBA intervention. </P>
<P>Misclassification bias for stillbirths versus failed resuscitations was another potential source of bias in studies, which would likely underestimate the effect, as better trained TBAs would be more likely to attempt resuscitation. The magnitude of this bias is not clear.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies involving over 1345 traditional birth attendants (TBAs), more than 32,000 women and approximately 57,000 births that examined the effects of TBA training for trained versus untrained TBAs (one study) and additionally trained TBA training versus trained TBAs (five studies) are included in this review. These studies consist of individual randomised trials (two studies) and cluster-randomised trials (four studies). The quality of the evidence in the included studies was mixed, several studies had problems with attrition and none of the studies was blinded; for outcomes that were self reported by women and for clinical outcomes recorded by TBAs the potential impact of bias is difficult to determine but results should be interpreted with caution. The primary outcomes across the sample of studies were perinatal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths (early, late and overall). The strengths of the three new studies included in this update are their design (community cluster-randomised trials), size (large scale) and common focus (newborn care and peri-neonatal outcomes). This allows us to begin to build the evidence needed to evaluate TBA training effectiveness in relation to peri-neonatal mortality, which we were unable to do in previous versions of this review (2007 and 2009). The main results are summarised below and focus on primary outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trained TBAs versus untrained TBAs</HEADING>
<P>One cluster-randomised trial found a significantly 30% lower perinatal death rate, 39% lower stillbirth rate and 29% lower neonatal death rate in the trained versus untrained TBA cluster.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Additionally trained TBAs versus trained TBAs</HEADING>
<P>Three large cluster-randomised trials compared TBAs who received additional training in initial steps of resuscitation, including bag-valve-mask ventilation, with TBAs who had received basic training in safe, clean delivery and immediate newborn care. Basic training included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (two studies) or bag-valve-mask resuscitation (one study). There was no significant perinatal death rate difference in the intervention and control clusters and no significant late neonatal death rate difference in intervention and control clusters. The neonatal death rate, however, was 45% lower in the intervention compared with the control clusters.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis conducted on two outcomes showed no significant differences between additionally trained TBAs versus trained TBAs for stillbirths (two studies) or early neonatal death rate (three studies). In the studies that examined stillbirths, all intervention and control cluster TBAs were trained in neonatal resuscitation, which may have resulted in apparent stillborns being resuscitated (and a reduction in births classified as stillbirths in both groups). Inadequate contrast between intervention and control TBAs&#8217; training may also explain the null result. In the three studies that reported early neonatal death rates (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>), reduction in the early neonatal death rate appears to favour additional TBA training in bag-valve-mask ventilation over basic TBA training, including mouth-to-mouth ventilation, but the differences were not significant. Note that <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> is heavily influencing the overall mean effect for early neonatal death rate and accounts for two-thirds of the weight in the weighted effect estimate, primarily due to a small standard error. As previously noted, a sensitivity analysis with this study removed reveals an effect estimate for early neonatal death that is larger and significant (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.90). Removal of either of the other two studies does not change the original results.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies included the appropriate types of participants, interventions and outcomes. However, most of the authors did not provide sufficient descriptions of the TBA training, TBA supervision and follow-up support (apart from data collection follow-up), or comparable information on the characteristics of the TBAs and women (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). While the number of studies in this updated review was too small to conduct subgroup analyses, this information would be useful to better understand the relationship between the intervention and results going forward and may have relevance for policy and practice.</P>
<P>The evidence in the review addressed the broad question about the effect of TBA training on health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes. It is based on findings from six studies from rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa (Republic of Congo, Zambia) and South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan). These are high mortality regions and/or countries where TBAs continue to assist women and families during labour, birth and the early postnatal period and access to skilled care is still limited. The findings are applicable to ongoing international policy discussions on how to best optimise training and deployment of different kinds of health workers (including lay health workers such as TBAs) for maternal and newborn health during the slow but gradual transition to skilled birth attendants.  </P>
<P>There was very little information in the included studies on the identification of, and referral for, obstetric complications by TBAs. In earlier versions of this review, given the overall paucity of evidence from randomised trials we included findings from a controlled before and after study examining additional training for TBAs (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Rourke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Rourke 1994</LINK>). This study reported findings relating to the identification and referral for malpresentation, prolonged labour and preterm birth before and after a training intervention for TBAs. Overall, the mean number of monthly referrals over the study period showed non-significant differences between intervention and control communities both during and after the intervention and baseline to post intervention identification of and referral for obstetric complications of malpresentation, prolonged labour and preterm labour among women referred by TBAs showed no significant difference for timely referral between the intervention and control communities.</P>

<P>Assessment of risk of bias in these studies raises concerns about the quality of evidence. Among individually randomised trials, risk of selection bias (sequence generation and allocation concealment) was high in <LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> and unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>; risks of performance and detection bias (blinding) and incomplete outcome data (attrition) were high in <LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK> and unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2000</LINK>; risk of incomplete outcome data was high in <LINK REF="STD-Bullough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bullough 1989</LINK>. Both studies reported all relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>Among cluster-randomised trials, risk of recruitment bias was high in <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>, and unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>. Risk of baseline imbalance was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK>. All authors reported minimal loss of clusters and individuals and conducted the appropriate statistical analyses, adjusting for design effect and baseline covariates. Moreover, all reported relevant outcome measures. None of the studies used blinding and thus were at risk for performance and detection bias. Although many of the primary and secondary outcomes were objective (mortality), the likely direction and magnitude of performance and detection biases on outcomes are uncertain (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the studies included in the meta-analysis of stillbirths (<LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>) and early neonatal deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK>), most of the information was of low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>A major limitation of this review is that most of the outcomes were reported in only one study. This could lead to a bias in interpretation of the results for these outcomes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a number of methods to mitigate potential bias in the review process. We searched both the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) Trials Register as well as citation alert, and conducted handsearches of the references of included studies. Two of the review authors independently extracted the data and four review authors assessed the included studies for risk of bias and reached consensus through virtual discussion (one external assessor). The analysis was conducted according to <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Among the studies in the review, one study included TBA training as a second intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>) and the other included TBAs as a subgroup of birth attendants (<LINK REF="STD-Carlo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 2010</LINK>). The amount of information about TBAs in these studies was limited to outcomes. We sought, but were unable to obtain additional information about TBA training intervention and results from <LINK REF="STD-Azad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Azad 2010</LINK>.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, the results of the meta-analysis revealed no substantial impact of TBA training on stillbirths and a promising 17% decrease in early neonatal mortality in the intervention clusters. A 2009 systematic review by Darmstadt and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Darmstadt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darmstadt 2009</LINK>) of the evidence of the ability of community-level providers to reduce intrapartum-related deaths found low to moderate quality evidence that TBA training may improve linkages with facilities and perinatal outcomes. Their review was based on the <LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> study that is included in this update review, and our own earlier meta-analysis of TBA training effectiveness which demonstrated an 11% reduction in perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sibley-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibley 2004c</LINK>). More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Lassi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassi 2010</LINK> reviewed 18 cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised trials and found significant reductions maternal morbidity (25%), stillbirths (16%), perinatal mortality (20%) and neonatal mortality (24%), along with increases in referral for complications (40%) and early breastfeeding (94%) as a consequence of implementing a broad range of community-level maternal and newborn care packages, many of which included a relationship with TBAs. As Osrin and Prost (<LINK REF="REF-Osrin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osrin 2010</LINK>) note: &#8220;TBAs have been largely abandoned as a cadre who could take useful health actions to reduce PMR. This abandonment has been at the level of international policy rather than ground reality.&#8221; This ground reality and the two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Darmstadt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darmstadt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lassi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassi 2010</LINK>) summarise a growing body of evidence for scaling-up community-based maternal and newborn care through packages that can be implemented by a range of community-level health workers.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rural settings in the developing world vary in terms of the role of traditional birth attendants (TBAs), the proportion of TBA-attended births, cultural norms and values regarding childbirth and childcare practices, general health of young girls and women, local causes of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity, and the social standing, functional status and resources of the health services. The relationships among poverty, women's health status and access to quality health care are especially important. Each is relevant to any discussion and practical decision regarding the feasibility and potential of TBA training to contribute to improved pregnancy outcomes in a given setting. Thus, in settings where there is an insufficient number of skilled birth attendants or limited access to health facilities, and women prefer TBAs, TBA training may be the only means to optimise the use of community-level heath workers for maternal and newborn health. Where skilled birth attendants and health facilities exist and are accessible, and women prefer TBAs, TBA training coupled with strategies to effectively engage them with the health system may be considered. In this update review, the only study of trained TBAs versus untrained TBAs suggests that biomedical training of TBAs who have not been exposed to such training may be beneficial. The remaining five studies comparing additionally trained TBAs and trained TBAs show no clear advantage of additional or advanced training. However, this finding may be due to an insufficient number of studies and the methodological issues in the included studies (risk of bias, lack of contrast in the intervention between the comparison groups).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-02 08:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review contains four large cluster-randomised trials. The small number of studies continues to reflect, in part, the challenges associated with conducting large community trials on the outcomes of complex public health interventions. </P>
<P>This review, nonetheless, provides the foundation upon which to incorporate future studies of the effect of TBA training for improved health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes that is necessary for building the evidence base. The design and methods of future studies must include adequate sample size, protection against common sources of bias, sufficient contrast between intervention and control groups to adequately assess the effect of TBA training, and, most importantly, report similar perinatal and neonatal mortality definitions and outcomes. A focus on TBA training in relation to reducing perinatal and neonatal death, the potential mechanisms involved in reducing deaths, strategies that link TBAs to health systems, and costs continue to hold the most promise. Future studies should include also at least the following information on participants, the intervention and outcomes, to permit subgroup analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>TBA age, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, experience (number of deliveries per year and number of years of practice), and proportion of all births attended in the study area;</LI>
<LI>maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status and educational attainment;</LI>
<LI>training method, content, duration, contact hours, trainer/trainee ratio, supportive supervision and education after training, boosters and context, e.g., whether training is a single invention or part of complex intervention, whether it is situated within an enabling environment that includes elements such as advocacy, community mobilisation, emergency transportation or adequate accessible referral sites; and</LI>
<LI>timing of measurement (observations) relative to the intervention, as well as data collection method and source.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is also need for research that seeks to improve family and community-based interventions, in relation to TBA training, and the links to skilled facility-based clinical care to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Key knowledge gaps continue to exist in these regards. Examples include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>more effective approaches for promotion of care seeking for life-threatening complications by improving problem recognition, increasing demand for quality care, and overcoming cultural barriers to referral;</LI>
<LI>methods to improve prevention or initial home-based management (first aid stabilisation), or both, and safe referral care;</LI>
<LI>best combinations of frontline health workers for family and community service delivery and the phasing of their roles or skills during the transition to skilled birth attendance;</LI>
<LI>strategies to optimise the deployment of frontline health workers and to improve collaboration and partnership among frontline health workers and the health system; and</LI>
<LI>better ways to monitor and evaluate health outcomes of community-based interventions, including vital registration, community-based surveillance, improved verbal autopsy methods to assess specific medical causes and contributing factors to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This updated review suggests that trained TBAs may be viable health workers in community-level intervention packages, particularly given their role during the vulnerable period in and around the time of birth. However, the evidence in the updated review remains inconclusive with respect to peri-neonatal mortality reduction due to an insufficient number of studies and the methodological issues of the included studies.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 2011</LINK> was the only study to include results for cause-specific neonatal mortality based on verbal autopsy. The authors identified 16 and 17 deaths attributed to serious infection in the intervention and control clusters, respectively (unadjusted RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.43, N = 3365 ); 10 and 21 deaths attributed to birth asphyxia in the intervention and control clusters (unadjusted RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78, N = 3365 ); 0 and 4 deaths from diarrhoea (unadjusted RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.59, N = 3365 ); 1 and 0 deaths from tetanus in the intervention and control clusters (unadjusted RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.09 to 56.82, N = 3365 ). Most neonatal deaths (64%) were attributed to birth asphyxia and serious infection. Deaths attributed to infection occurred at similar rates in the intervention and control clusters, while deaths from apparent birth asphyxia were significantly lower (63%) in the intervention compared with the control clusters. Two neonatal deaths, 1 and 1 in the intervention and control clusters, respectively, were not assigned a cause. Other neonatal mortality outcomes were reported but these are not a focus of this review.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>TBAs and the data collectors were not blinded. TBAs conducted case ascertainment. In rural communities without basic facilities the difference between a stillbirth and a baby that does not respond to resuscitation may not be easy to discern. TBAs completed and shared standardised birth records for every delivery (including infant&#8217;s vital status on the day of delivery) with their data collector within 48 hours of delivery.</P>
<P>Data collectors followed activities of all TBAs in their specific geographic area via weekly face-to-face contact. Prospective monitoring of the TBAs&#8217; pregnant woman and due dates likely reduced detection bias of deaths. The data collector reviewed and verified the report contents with the TBA and carried out follow-up visits (at 1 and 4 weeks) with the mother and infant pair.</P>
<P>A panel of 3 neonatologists, who were blinded to group allocation and had no contact with TBAs or data collectors, independently reviewed delivery reports and verbal autopsies for stillbirths and neonatal deaths recorded at any time in the first month after birth. They assigned a presumptive cause of death, selecting from a pre-specified list of causes. Concordance of 2 reviewers was recorded. Their assessments were necessarily based on the TBA and data collectors.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This study was not stopped early. Secondary outcome data by randomisation group (for TBAs) were not reported in this study. Randomisation may have been compromised due to the purposive selection of districts and upazilas, the stratification of sampling, as well as the restricted number of clusters.</P>
<P>While the women&#8217;s group intervention did not show statistical interaction with the TBA intervention, confounding by the women&#8217;s group intervention could be present as differences in climactic conditions, gender-based barriers, presence of NGOs which offered financial incentives (and thus decreased participation) could have occurred, especially as all these factors were associated with the clusters in which the women&#8217;s group intervention was present. The authors reported that a greater proportion of women&#8217;s group intervention clusters had less education and household assets, and were younger, compared to control cluster women.</P>
<P>Though not stated, it is plausible that the various &#8220;health service inputs,&#8221; provided at various health services levels (e.g., training provided to doctors, nurses and paramedical staff working at district upazila and union levels) differed between the intervention and control groups.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The authors note that while it is plausible that intervention TBAs could have shared their additional skills with control TBAs, there was no evidence this occurred, and that the effect of this is likely to be minimal. They state that this is because the intervention TBAs received amoxicillin and equipment (e.g., resuscitation masks, suction bulbs) that weren't likely to be transferred to control TBAs. Additionally, they note &#8220;the effect of cross contamination of skills&#8221; would render the control birth attendants more like the intervention ones,&#8221; resulting in a bias towards the null.   </P>
<P>It is not clear whether intervention TBAs were more likely to identify pregnancies at high risk and refer women for birth at a health centre (there were more referrals from the intervention group in the postnatal period); it is possible that there was a disproportionate number of intervention TBA deliveries at health centres. Numbers of early labour and high-risk pregnancy referrals were not reported.</P>
<P>Much attention to quality data collection in this study. Misclassification of failed resuscitations as stillbirths was addressed by comparing stillbirth rates between the intervention and control groups and calculating overall mortality rates, including and excluding stillbirths.</P>

<P>Difficult to assess without access to study protocol. The study did not have the power to identify a difference between groups for 1 of the 2 selected primary outcomes (maternal death).</P>
<P>The authors state, however, &#8220;We do not have information on the acceptance or the outcomes of these referrals [to public or private facilities].&#8221; While they report that the intervention did not significantly increase the number of referrals in intervention clusters, it is not clear if the different types of women [perhaps those who learned they were at high risk because of the intervention] subsequently went to the facilities and lower risk women [who felt confident delivering at home because of the intervention] decided not to deliver at facilities. If this happened, then it could be a source for bias, in that high-risk women were not counted in the birth outcomes results, showing an artificially beneficial result of the intervention on mortality.</P>
<P>While maternal mortality is an objective outcome, maternal morbidity as measured was not in this study.  LHWs were taught the signs of the major obstetric complications and used a list with definitions to ask postpartum women if they had each complication. It is impossible to assess the validity of self report of complications.   </P>

<P>&#8220;In the assessment of the traditional birth attendant intervention, only home deliveries were included in the analysis.&#8221; This exclusion is not likely to carry a high risk of bias. It probably best captures those who were exposed to the TBAs&#8217; bag-valve-mask resuscitation skills. It also likely creates a better comparison group (i.e., other home births) for assessing the effectiveness of this intervention. (Further stratified analysis comparing births in which a TBA who received the intervention was present to those in which the TBA was not present would have been useful for assessing the true effect of the intervention, as done in the Gill et al study).  Of 12,519 home births in intervention clusters, 8618 (69%) were attended by any TBA, but only 2792 (22%) were attended by a TBA who received the bag-valve-mask resuscitation training.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>It is notable that intervention group TBAs attended significantly more deliveries than control group TBAs (P = 0.03), a difference that increased over the study, suggesting that pregnant women may have become aware of the TBAs&#8217; additional training. Thus contamination of participants may have occurred. While the clusters roughly corresponded to the catchment area in which each TBA operated, adjacent catchment areas often overlapped. Participants may have learned about the additional training and services the intervention TBAs provided and elected to use these TBAs.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>An obstetric team for antenatal care outreach clinics joined mothers together in care-seeking activities while strengthening use of the talukas as clusters provided a cohesive way to connect TBAs with existing health resources. Cluster-level interventions like the use of obstetric teams for antenatal care outreach clinics in intervention clusters may have resulted in a &#8220;herd effect&#8221; of the TBA by facilitating knowledge sharing amongst women and changes in care-seeking attitudes for referrals.</P>

<P>This review was selected for presentation at one of our regular journal clubs. A number of comments arose from our discussions, and we thought we would like to share them with you.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Title and inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>The title of the review and inclusion criteria do not best reflect the scope of this review, which is not simply training for traditional birth attendants, but also more complex intervention packages. The more complex interventions include improvements to facility based care and community interventions, supply of materials, liaison with the formal health sector, and supervision. We suggest the title refers to &#8216;traditional birth attendants programmes&#8217; or &#8216;traditional birth attendant training and support programmes&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Background</HEADING>
<P>It would be useful to include a short general description of the varied social contexts in which traditional birth attendants work, how their relationships with formal health services were initiated and developed, and whose agenda the relationships were fulfilling. Also, it would be helpful to mention the strategy of including traditional birth attendants in biomedically orientated training and service improvement programmes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The interventions are complex and contextually bound, so it is important to describe the context and intervention used in each study as fully as possible. Also, when evaluating such a complex intervention, it is important to take account of the content and delivery of the training provided, if these are available. The authors describe the review as a &#8216;systematic narrative review&#8217;.  In which case more detail is required, in the included studies table and the additional tables, on the components of the training programmes/ interventions, including any improvements to the health system. In the case of the training for example, where did the training take place? How long was the training? What was the mix of theory and practice? What pedagogic approach was used? Were the trainers trained themselves to teach?  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>One large study showed significant reductions in stillbirths, perinatal and neonatal deaths, and serious maternal complications, plus a reduction in maternal mortality that, while not significant, at 26% is certainly encouraging. This suggests that traditional birth attendant training programmes, in conjunction with improved health systems, have the potential to significantly improve outcome for mothers and babies. It is worth looking more closely into how this programme achieved such remarkable results. It suggests that some further research should concentrate on evaluating whether this model of provision might be effective in other contexts, and even how it might be improved on.  </P>

<P>In response, to each section of the feedback:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Title and inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>The inclusion criteria state that the intervention is traditional birth attendant training.  Like most interventions, traditional birth attendant training is nested within health systems and settings with a variety of interrelated components. Only two of the four included studies described traditional birth attendant training as a component of a more complex program or health service (<LINK REF="STD-Jokhio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jokhio 2005</LINK> and O'Rourke 1994a). For this reason, we do not agree that changing the title of the review would improve the fit between title and scope of review; in fact it might be misleading.  In the review we do discuss the challenge of evaluating complex program interventions. Training is a key activity in any traditional birth attendant program.  Adding the term &#8216;program&#8217;, and changing the title to read &#8216;Traditional birth attendant training programs for improving health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes&#8217; might be appropriate, though we are not sure this is an improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Background</HEADING>
<P>The background does describe the typical work arrangements, payment agreements and settings for traditional birth attendants. We are not sure what additional information is being requested, and would welcome specific examples. We agree traditional birth attendant training reflects a biomedical agenda. We do not address the implications of this for traditional birth attendant training because we did not see the review as the appropriate place for such a discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We agree with the feedback.  In the <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK> we state that <I>where available</I> we provide information on characteristics of participants and of the intervention. Information in the main body of the review, in the included studies table, and in the additional tables reflects what was reported for each included studies. Where information is missing it is because it was not reported. The lack of sufficient descriptive information about participants and the intervention is a major limitation of most reports. In the conclusions to the review we urge future trials to provide complete descriptions.  For future updates we will contact trial authors to ask for this additional information.</P>
<P>We used the term &#8216;systematic narrative review&#8217; because we were unable to pool the study findings in a quantitative synthesis due to heterogeneity in the outcomes reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>We agree with the feedback, and state this in the conclusion.  We note that potential mechanisms underlying these promising effects were not addressed in this trial, and that another trial suggests appropriate referral to improved health services is a key factor. In implications for research, we will add the phrase &#8216;further research to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of this promising program is warranted&#8217;.</P>

<P>We also contacted agencies involved in global reproductive health for unpublished literature. We retrieved and screened the references of published studies for additional potentially relevant documents, and retrieved copies of the published articles. We searched the Internet for reports of training projects implemented and evaluated by international organisations, United Nations organisations such as United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the World Health Organization, as well as other non-governmental organisations engaged in community-based work such as CARE, Save the Children Foundation and World Vision. Finally, we contacted experts in the field for information and collection of unpublished material.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed potentially eligible studies for inclusion against the following criteria:<BR/>(a) research design is a randomised controlled trial, a time series study or a controlled before/after study;<BR/>(b) intervention is traditional birth attendant (TBA) training;<BR/>(c) intervention and comparison group data are derived from trained and untrained TBAs (reference to target intervention), or mothers and neonates whose care is provided by trained and untrained TBAs, or who are living in areas where trained and untrained TBAs attend a majority of births; and<BR/>(d) dependent measures are categorical or continuous and concern TBA and maternal behaviours listed above or life-threatening conditions listed above and defined using standard case definitions, and pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>We calculated inter-coder reliability for eligibility using percentage agreement, resolved any differences by discussion and noted the reasons for excluding a particular study. We entered all studies into the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Details of the search procedure are provided in the 'Description of studies' section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We used the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Data Collection Checklist and Data Collection Template, as well as developed and pretested supplementary data collection forms such that we abstracted additional information pertaining to study references and authors, verification of eligibility, as well as study methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results. Three co-authors independently extracted and coded the data, discussed and resolved any differences. A fourth author independently checked a portion of the abstraction. We contacted an investigator for two studies having incomplete information. In some cases the authors provided enough information for us to calculate the missing outcome data using EXCEL software and entered data into the Review Manager software for analysis (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed studies for methodological quality examining different sources of bias following criteria established by the Cochrane EPOC Group (www.epoc.uottawa.ca) and summarising risk of bias as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The Cochrane EPOC Group's standard criteria for appraising the quality of studies include baseline measurement of outcomes, follow-up of professionals, follow-up of patients/episodes of care (protection against exclusion bias), blinded assessment of primary outcomes (protection against detection bias), reliable outcome measures and protection against contamination. An additional criterion for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials study includes concealment of allocation, while the analogous criterion for controlled before-after studies includes characteristics for studies using second site as control (protection against selection bias). To derive an overall summary assessment of how valid the results of each study are, we used three categories in which a 'low risk' of bias exists when all criteria are met (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter results); a 'moderate risk' of bias exists when one or more criteria are partially met (plausible bias raises some doubt about results); and a 'high risk' of bias exists when one or more criteria are not met (plausible bias seriously weakens confidence results) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect and unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>We used <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK> to calculate individual effect sizes of odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals or mean difference for the individual outcomes when possible. We used descriptive statistics to report characteristics of the participants, interventions and outcome measures detailed above. Due to the small number of studies, varied study designs and heterogeneity of the outcomes and measures, we were not able to calculate pooled summary effect sizes.</P>
