<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-27 16:03:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how well botulinum toxin works as a treatment for strabismus. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and included six studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>The evidence as to the benefits and harms of using botulinum toxin for strabismus is uncertain.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
<BR/>Strabismus occurs when the eyes are not aligned. Usually one eye turns inwards or outwards. Less frequently one eye turns upwards or downwards. It is commonly known as "squint".</P>
<P>Strabismus can lead to blurred vision or double vision. In children it can affect the long term development of vision in the affected eye. There are many causes of strabismus. In most cases, there are problems with the muscles or nerves around the eye.</P>
<P>Doctors can use botulinum toxin to stop individual muscles around the eye working for a while. This may help the eyes become more aligned and may lead to less blurred or double vision. One problem with using botulinum toxin is that it can result in a droopy eyelid (ptosis).</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
<BR/>The review shows that:</P>
<P>&#8226; using botulinum toxin in children requiring primary treatment or retreatment for strabismus may make no difference, or slightly reduce the chances of recovering correct alignment of the eyes compared with surgery (low-certainty evidence);<BR/>&#8226; using botulinum toxin in adults with strabismus may decrease the chances of recovering correct alignment of the eyes compared with surgery (low-certainty evidence);<BR/>&#8226; people with sixth nerve palsy receiving botulinum toxin may have a similar or small increased chance of correct alignment of eyes compared with no treatment (low-certainty evidence);<BR/>&#8226; the evidence on using botulinum toxin with surgery, compared with surgery alone, was very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence);<BR/>&#8226; ptosis occurred commonly in people receiving botulinum toxin in these studies. The number of people affected ranged from 1 in 10 to 1 in 2 people. Everyone recovered when treatment stopped. Ptosis occurred less frequently when treated with botulinum toxin combined with sodium hyaluronate compared to botulinum toxin alone.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 11 July 2016.</P>

<P>The use of botulinum toxin as an investigative and treatment modality for strabismus is well reported in the medical literature. However, it is unclear how effective it is in comparison to other treatment options for strabismus.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-27 16:03:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Six RCTs were eligible for inclusion. We judged the included studies as at a mixture of low, unclear and high risk of bias. We did not consider any of the included studies as at low risk of bias for all domains.</P>
<P>Two trials conducted in Spain (102 people, number of eyes not specified) compared botulinum toxin with surgery in children that required retreatment for acquired or infantile esotropia. These two studies provided low-certainty evidence that children who received botulinum toxin may have a similar or slightly reduced chance of achieving ocular alignment (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.16), binocular single vision (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.23), sensory fusion (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.23) and stereopsis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25) compared with children who received surgery. One trial from Canada compared botulinum toxin with surgery in 30 adults (30 eyes) with horizontal strabismus and reported a reduced chance of ocular alignment with botulinum toxin (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>One trial in the UK suggested that botulinum toxin may result in a similar or slightly improved chance of ocular alignment in people with acute onset sixth nerve palsy compared with observation (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.48; 47 participants, low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Very low-certainty evidence from one trial from Brazil suggested that adjuvant botulinum toxin in strabismus surgery may increase the chances of ocular alignment compared with strabismus surgery alone (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.41 to 8.11; 23 participants).</P>
<P>One trial from China of 47 participants (94 eyes) suggested that people receiving botulinum toxin combined with sodium hyaluronate may have a similar or slightly reduced chance of achieving ocular alignment compared with botulinum toxin alone (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.82; low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>
Reported complications in people given botulinum toxin in the included trials included ptosis (range 9% to 41.66%) and vertical deviation (range 8.3% to 18.51%). Ptosis occurred less frequently when treated with botulinum toxin combined with sodium hyaluronate compared to botulinum toxin alone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-27 16:03:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Most published literature on the use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of strabismus consists of retrospective studies, cohort studies or case reviews. Although these provide useful descriptive information, clarification is required as to the effective use of botulinum toxin as an independent treatment modality. Six RCTs on the therapeutic use of botulinum toxin in strabismus, graded as low and very low-certainty evidence, have shown varying responses. These include a lack of evidence for effect of botulinum toxin on reducing visual symptoms in acute sixth nerve palsy, poor response in people with horizontal strabismus without binocular vision, similar or slightly reduced achievement of successful ocular alignment in children with esotropia and potential increased achievement of successful ocular alignment where surgery and botulinum toxin are combined. Further high quality trials using robust methodologies are required to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of various forms of botulinum toxin (e.g. Dysport, Xeomin, etc), to compare botulinum toxin with and without adjuvant solutions and to compare botulinum toxin to alternative surgical interventions in strabismus cases with and without potential for binocular vision.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-31 22:23:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-05 21:46:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Strabismus is a deviation of the ocular alignment where one eye turns, which may be intermittent or constant. It is a common condition that occurs in up to 5% of the population and up to 50% in special populations such as those with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donnelly-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnelly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Str_x00f6_mland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strömland 1993</LINK>). In forms of strabismus that are intermittent, binocular function (using both eyes as a pair) is maintained with straight eyes for a variable proportion of the time. In other forms there is a manifest deviation usually with a variable degree of suppression of the deviating eye. Strabismus can be further divided into esotropia (inturning deviation), exotropia (out-turning deviation) or, less commonly, hypertropia (upturning deviation), hypotropia (downturning deviation) and cyclotropia (rotatory deviation). Strabismus can be caused by a variety of insults such as abnormal anatomical development of extraocular muscles or the orbit, impaired neurological input to extraocular muscles, uncorrected refractive error or hereditary factors. Sequelae to strabismus can include blurring of vision, diplopia (double vision), impaired depth (3-D) perception, and in younger children, amblyopia. Amblyopia is impaired vision in the deviating eye due to the lack of correct stimulation of that eye and results in permanent loss of vision if left untreated at a young age.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-31 22:23:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are various treatments associated with strabismus. Primarily treatment is directed at aligning the visual axes. Conservative options include prisms to realign the visual axes and orthoptic exercises to promote and establish binocular control of ocular alignment where both eyes can subsequently work as a pair. Invasive treatment options include surgery to permanently alter extraocular muscle function and thus permanently change ocular alignment, and botulinum toxin to individual extraocular muscles. <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1980</LINK> first described this latter option, which temporarily paralyses the extraocular muscle and results in a changed ocular alignment that resolves over time (usually a two to three month time interval). During this period of altered eye position, the visual axes may adopt an ocular alignment that permits binocular single vision. This is the ability to use both eyes as a pair so that both eyes contribute to seeing a single image. This may persist or regress necessitating further treatment. Botulinum toxin injection to extraocular muscles is an alternative option that has become established in the treatment of adults who have strabismus. Its use in children is less well studied. It is perceived to be difficult to use in children due to the need for sedation and complications following leakage of the toxin into the levator palpebral superioris muscle (the muscle responsible for elevating the eyelid) thus resulting in a droopy upper lid, known as ptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Botulinum toxin has become recognised and accepted as both an adjunct and alternative to strabismus surgery in many types of strabismus (<LINK REF="REF-Bunting-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunting 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crouch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerr-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ozkan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozkan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabetti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabetti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tejedor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tejedor 2001</LINK>). Diagnostic uses of botulinum toxin include investigation of postoperative diplopia (double vision), to detect whether fusion (which contributes to binocular vision) is present preoperatively, to differentially diagnose between a part and complete sixth nerve palsy, to aid in the prediction of surgical results for incomitant deviations and to help in the investigation of a possible slipped muscle following surgery. In terms of therapeutic uses botulinum toxin has been found useful in treating facial muscle spasm, strabismus, nystagmus, corneal ulceration and exposure keratitis to name a few. The therapeutic uses of botulinum toxin for strabismus are to restore fusion in those people with decompensating deviations, or those with a recovering sixth nerve palsy, to align the cosmetic form of strabismus, to aid surgical overcorrections and undercorrections and to aid in the improvement of visual acuity by relieving oscillopsia (perception of moving images) in cases of acquired nystagmus.<BR/>Other treatment options associated with strabismus include those that address the sequelae of strabismus, such as occlusion therapy for amblyopia which is a reduction in vision caused completely or in part by the strabismus.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-05 21:53:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Botulinum toxin is a drug that is an exotoxin of the bacterium <I>Clostridium botulinum</I>. Botulinum toxin type A is an injectable neurotoxin. In order for muscles to contract, acetylcholine is released at the nerve-muscle junction. Acetylcholine binds to muscle receptors causing a contraction. Botulinum toxin selectively blocks the release of acetylcholine from the cholinergic synapses found within a muscle, thereby blocking the nerve impulses and preventing contraction of the muscle cells. Paralysis (which is temporary) follows within days after injection of the toxin into the extraocular muscle, and the toxin becomes fully effective within three to seven days of the injection. The duration of paralysis is dependent on the individual, but generally lasts for three months. Once a muscle is paralysed, opposing muscles take on a greater movement force and the eye position changes allowing the visual axes to move into a straighter eye alignment.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-09 18:35:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clear guidelines do not exist as to the recommended use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of strabismus particularly as so many types of strabismus exist. Much of the published literature pertains to retrospective case series with varying treatment modalities using different types of botulinum toxin (e.g. Dysport&#8482; or Botox&#8482; or Prosign&#8482; ) and different doses of the toxin.</P>

The latter was calculated as preoperative deviation - postoperative deviation/preoperative deviation x 100%. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were stipulated for the trial. Both groups were regarded as comparable as similarities were present for both groups regarding previous surgical procedures, mean age at initial surgery, average time lapse between first and second treatment, angle of deviation, refractive error and visual acuity measures.

This was a parallel RCT. These groups were compared to each other for clinical diagnosis of recovery. A full recovery was defined as completely normal ocular rotations with full field of binocular single vision. Stable recovery was defined as normal binocular single vision with a minor asymptomatic abduction defect or a small asymptomatic vertical deviation. Non recovery was defined as a persisting esotropia in primary position with diplopia not controllable by normal amplitudes of fusional vergence. Two control participants were excluded and four were lost to follow-up. One botulinum toxin participant was lost to follow-up. Follow-up ranged from four to 42 months. Both groups were considered homogenous as gender, age range, aetiology of sixth nerve palsy, duration of symptoms and laterality of palsy were similar across both groups. The mean deviation of control participants was 17.8 PD and for botulinum toxin participants was 28.6 PD. The difference in deviation across both groups was significant (P = 0.02).

This RCT had a cross-over design. These groups were compared to each other for alignment of deviation &#8806; 10 PD. In addition, percent net change was documented which was defined as preoperative deviation - postoperative deviation/preoperative deviation x 100%. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were stipulated for the trial. Both groups had similar angles of deviation and similar numbers of esotropia and exotropia angles. The trial authors stated that five participants required further treatment. However they did not provide any information as to whether this constituted a cross-over of treatment options.

Group A received strabismus surgery plus botulinum toxin and group B received strabismus surgery with placebo (hyaline solution). The groups were compared for net percentage change in angle of deviation from pre-operative to 1 day through to six to 12 months postoperative in addition to numbers achieving alignment less than 8 PD. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were stipulated for the trial. Both groups were regarded as homogenous as similarities were present for age at surgery, angle of pre-operative deviation, surgery ratio, best corrected visual acuity of either eye and percentage of severe amblyopia.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-02-27 16:06:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included six randomised controlled trials in this review which compared botulinum toxin (Dysport&#8482; or Botox&#8482; or Prosign&#8482;) to either strabismus surgery or conservative treatment or adjuvant solution. The strabismus conditions treated in five trials were unlikely to alter with time without treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), whereas the ocular motility condition in the remaining trial was likely to change spontaneously with time (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>). Risk calculations in anticipated absolute effects across the different types of interventions in these trials varied greatly. This is reflective of the heterogenous groups that comprised different intervention comparisons and different types of ocular motility conditions.</P>
<P>From these trials we were able to make the following comparisons based on the information available in the trial papers: botulinum toxin as an alternative to conservative treatment; botulinum toxin as an alternative to surgical treatment; surgery with or without adjuvant botulinum toxin, botulinum toxin with or without an adjuvant solution; strabismus types with binocular potential versus those without binocular potential; and reported complications. Notably, for this last comparison, we were unable to evaluate occurrence of complications across a range of different doses due to insufficient data in the trial results.</P>
<P>We found the certainty of evidence for all outcomes to be of moderate- or low-certainty primarily due to risk of bias and imprecise results because of lack of clarity in reporting trial methodology. We were able to address the primary outcome of improved ocular alignment as measured by a reduction in angle of deviation in all six trials. However, the main limiting factor for analysis was that results were not comparable across the trials due to different conditions being targeted by each trial plus the different types and doses of botulinum toxin used in each trial. We were able to address the primary classification outcome (success, satisfactory A, satisfactory B or fail) in one trial only (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>), as two trials provided the information for change in angle of deviation and binocular outcome separately (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), and there was no binocular outcome for the participants in the remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes included achievement of binocular single vision and documentation of adverse effects. We determined the former outcome in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), but again the results were not comparable due to differences in target condition and use of botulinum toxin. Four trials used Botox&#8482; (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), one trial used Dysport&#8482; (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>), and one trial used Prosign&#8482; (<LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>), with varying doses utilised for each drug type. Hence the reported adverse effects were not comparable between trials. However, one trial compared the same type of botulinum toxin (Botox&#8482;) with one group receiving Botox&#8482; plus sodium hyaluronate and the second group receiving Botox&#8482; only (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>). This trial showed a significant increase in ptosis as an adverse event in the Botox&#8482; only group.</P>
<P>We were not able to obtain information on the cost of treatment or on measures of participant or parent satisfaction relating to treatment options and effectiveness of botulinum toxin.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-02 15:17:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a large body of literature on the subject of the use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of strabismus. Strabismus encompasses many types including esotropia, exotropia, vertical deviations, concomitant, acute onset and incomitant strabismus, plus strabismus with or without binocular vision. Therefore there are many variables that contribute to outcome after treatment. The literature on botulinum toxin consists predominantly of retrospective studies, cohort studies and case series, which are useful for describing the use of botulinum toxin in varying strabismus types but do not aid the establishment of reliable guidelines for the use of botulinum toxin as a treatment intervention or enable interpretation of treatment efficacy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Improved ocular alignment</HEADING>
<P>This was defined as measurement of a reduction in the angle of deviation by prisms or the synoptophore. All included trials achieved a reduction in angle of deviation using botulinum toxin to within 10 PD, ranging from 29.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>), 30.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>), 33.33% (<LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>), 66.66% (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>), 69.56% (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), to 95.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>). The lowest percentage was achieved in a strabismus condition that did not have binocular potential and this was significantly different from the reduction in angle of deviation achieved by surgery in this trial. The highest percentage was achieved in an ocular motility condition in which all participants had binocular potential. The reduction in angle of deviation achieved using botulinum toxin in three trials where participants had binocular potential showed no significant difference to the reduction in angle of deviation achieved by strabismus surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), or by observation/conservative treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Percentage net change in deviation was also calculated for five trials. For RCTs that compared botulinum toxin to reoperation, the percentage net change was not significant across both groups in which the strabismus type included presence of binocular vision as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>). For one trial where the strabismus type specifically excluded binocular vision, the percentage net change was significantly lower for the botulinum toxin group in comparison to the adjustable suture surgery group (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>). For a second trial in which the strabismus type had no demonstrable binocular vision, the net percentage change was greater for the surgery group combined with botulinum toxin compared to surgery alone (<LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>). For the trial that compared botulinum toxin to observation for recent onset sixth nerve palsy, the change in ocular alignment was similar for both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effect size of risk ratio (RR) varied from 0.79 (botulinum toxin versus surgery) to 0.81 (botulinum toxin with versus without sodium hyaluronate) to 1.19 (botulinum toxin versus observation) to 1.83 (surgery with or without botulinum toxin).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A successful outcome was classed as full control of the ocular deviation with a measurement within 10 PD and with normal binocular single vision. This was achieved in 86% (botulinum toxin) and 80% (controls) respectively in participants from the trial of sixth nerve palsies (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). There was insufficient information provided in the trials by as outcomes for change in deviation and binocular vision were provided separately and not integrated (<LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK> excluded participants with binocular vision potential and <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK> did not report any information on binocular potential for their participants. Thus we could not apply our classification of successful outcome to these trials. Achievement of binocular vision was further classified in this review as satisfactory A (angle within 20 PD with binocular vision), satisfactory B (angle within 20 PD without binocular vision) and fail (little or no change in angle and without binocular vision). We were unable to use these classifications in <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK> as measurements were not provided for the participants that failed to obtain a successful outcome plus outcomes for binocular vision were stated separately to outcomes for angle of deviation. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK> reported a successful outcome in 80% and 95.5%, satisfactory A outcome in 12% and 0% and a failed outcome for 8% and 4.5% for non treatment and botulinum toxin treatment groups respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The participants recruited in <LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK> had no reported binocular function and thus would not fall in the satisfactory A classification. We were unable to classify participants from the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK> to satisfactory B or fail categories with reliability as deviations were stated as greater than 10 PD but with no ranges provided for these unsuccessful participants. 23.1% of the surgery group and 70.6% of the botulinum toxin group were either satisfactory B or fail classifications. Five of 30 participants were unsatisfied with their exotropia deviation and required further treatment. The range of final responses for all participants having botulinum toxin spread from 0 to 100% change in deviation (0 would be classed as a fail) and for participants having surgery, the spread was 67% to 100% change. <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK> reported 5/12 participants in group A and 6/11 participants in group B as achieving satisfactory B with angles of deviation of less than 20 PD, and 2/12 participants in group A plus 3/11 participants in group B achieving a fail with angles of deviation greater than 20 PD. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK> reported no data on angles of deviation greater than 10 PD at follow-up.</P>

The included trials reported transient ptosis in 23.4%, 37.03%, 9%, 34.78%, 41.6% and 20.8% respectively and reported transient vertical deviation in 17.39%, 18.51%, 18%, 8.3% and 2.2% respectively for occurrence of adverse outcomes per participant (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>).

<P>Six RCTs of low-certainty evidence met the inclusion criteria of this review. Each trial related to a different type of strabismus or ocular motility condition; namely infantile esotropia, acute onset esotropia, sixth nerve palsy and horizontal strabismus without binocular vision. Hence this precluded a meta-analysis. It was not possible to ascertain information on dose effect as the six included trials used different types of botulinum toxin (Botox&#8482; versus Dysport&#8482; versus Prosign&#8482;) and different dosages. In addition, we were unable to obtain information on the cost of treatment or on measures of participant or parent satisfaction relating to treatment options and effectiveness.

<P>As far as we are aware we have minimised potential biases in the review process. We have followed the methods set out in the published protocol. The only amendment was to add in a summary of findings table and GRADE assessment as required by new Cochrane standards. To our knowledge, all potentially eligible studies were included - we implemeted an extensive search strategy with independent checks by both authors of the search results. See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>We obtained mixed results when we evaluated the included trials for risk of bias. One study was at low risk of bias in relation to sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>). This was unclear for the other included trials.

This was not achieved by the other trials. We considered all trials as at low risk of bias for the domains of masking, incomplete outcome bias and selective outcome reporting. However, we judged all trials as unclear in relation to the potential risk of other sources of bias. This was due to small participant numbers in each trial group for five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minguini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Minguini 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tejedor 1999</LINK>), and due to early discharge of participants who had shown recovery before a six-month follow up period with lack of long-term follow up comparison across both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-02 15:21:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results are in general agreement with published observation studies of the use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of strabismus. Notably, these observation studies consider a variety of strabismus or ocular motility conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1980</LINK>) and each trial in this review also addressed a different strabismus or ocular motility condition. In addition, the included trials used different types and doses of botulinum toxin - similar to other observation studies published in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayner 1999</LINK>). It was thus not possible to compare these studies for agreement or disagreement of results. Botulinum toxin shows no difference in response in comparison to surgery in participants who required retreatment for acquired esotropia or infantile esotropia and in whom there was potential for binocular vision. Botulinum enhanced the effect of strabismus surgery in participants with strabismus without binocular potential. Botulinum toxin had a poorer effect in comparison to surgery in participants with strabismus without binocular potential. It showed no difference compared to no treatment in acute sixth nerve palsy and thus was deemed to have no prophylactic effect in this condition. The occurrence of adverse effects was similar to those reported in previous observation studies, particularly ptosis and induced vertical deviations (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayner 1999</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-02-27 16:04:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Due to the limited number of RCTs identified in this review, the low-certainty of evidence and the variations in the conditions being treated, it has not been possible to address fully the outcomes of this review.</P>
<P>Without considering the type of strabismus or ocular motility being treated, botulinum toxin has been shown to reduce the angle of deviation by amounts comparable to surgical intervention. However, the type of strabismus is important when considering the secondary outcome of binocular vision. In horizontal strabismus types without potential for binocular vision there was a poorer treatment effect reported with botulinum toxin treatment compared to strabismus surgery. However, for horizontal strabismus types without potential for binocular vision, there was an improved treatment effect reported with combined strabismus surgery and botulinum toxin in comparison to surgery alone. In those strabismus types where there is potential for binocular vision, such as acute onset esotropia, sixth nerve palsy and infantile esotropia, botulinum toxin has been shown to achieve little difference in levels of binocular vision compared to surgery. Therefore on the basis of these studies botulinum toxin can be considered as an independent treatment option.</P>
<P>In terms of adverse events there was difficulty in evaluating the studies because of the varying doses and types of botulinum toxin used. For trials using comparable types and/or doses of Botox&#8482; the prevalence of reported adverse events were similar with approximately one third of cases developing transient ptosis and one fifth developing transient vertical deviation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-15 15:39:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There is clearly a need for good quality trials to be conducted utilising botulinum toxin across the varying types of strabismus in order to improve the evidence base for the use of botulinum toxin as an independent management option. Standardisation is of utmost importance taking into consideration the types of botulinum toxin available and the dosages used as these aspects are not comparable. The presence or absence of binocular vision is also an important variable to consider in future trials.</P>

<P>We used the 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Given the developments in the production and use of botulinum toxin since the original protocol, for interventions in the current review, we added comparisons for the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comparison of botulinum toxin alternatives, i.e. different brands of botulinum toxin compared to each other;</LI>
<LI>comparison of botulinum toxin with and without added substances, e.g. sodium hyaluronate, saline.</LI>

<P>*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% CI) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
